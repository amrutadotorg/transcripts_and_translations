[Part 1 starts at 3:09:26]
Welcome to Ganapatipule.
[Applause]
[Some big noise] He suddenly got called and I think you should all be careful about it, and not to expose yourself too much. Especially in the night, be careful. Today’s program is first to announce all the marriages fixed.
[Applause]
We have already announced so many marriages and so many were not fixed. We try to do the last bit of it, and it will take about half an hour only. But whosoever is called, please stand up in your own place. You need not come down. We try, you see, very difficult, to have an international marriage. So, we try to match, as far as possible, with their heights, with their education, and with their looks also. I hope you’ll like our choice. But if you don’t like, from today I am telling you, please, let us know that you don’t want to get married, or you don’t want to have a particular choice for yourself. It’s much better to do it now. But after getting married, passing all through this ordeal, if you say ‘no’ to someone it’s very hard. Because sometimes, you are registered, and lots of problems are caused because of that. We thought that all such people who, after marriage, misbehave or say ‘no’, will have to go out of Sahaja Yoga. We can’t help it.
[Applause]
Now you have four days here to decide, four days. And, in that time, if you cannot decide, then we can’t help it. But don’t say, "It's an atmosphere". It's, "Somebody says". Nothing, you decide on your own. It has caused us lots of problems so far so, that I told Yogi, "Stop this marriage business". As it is, there are a lot of problems in the choice also. So, in such a short time, whatever we have done also, we must have made some misadjustments. I accept that. If you don’t want to marry someone, you please tell us. We are not going to get angry for that or say anything. But, understand that we have tried.
Now, there are some people, thirty-nine years old, supposing. And they want to marry only Indians. It’s impossible. And under these circumstances, we can’t help you.
[Video starts here]

If you put restrictions; of course, we observe the restrictions. But in that case, there’s a problem.
[Hindi]
So now we will start. All right? Also, those people who were announced before – there were some girls who were missing; some boys, they were missing. So also you can find out and try to match.
[Hindi]
Yogi has been working very systematically. He is working very hard. And don’t think that I have not seen. I have seen all of them. But still, you must know that in such a short time, to decide is very difficult.
[Hindi]

Sahaja Yogi: Doctor Valentino.

[No audio. Starts again with wedding announcements by Sahaja Yogis].

[Names of couples are announced for the next ten minutes.]

Shri Mataji: I think we have to start the music programme now. About these marriages, I will tell you later on. But we have found out that Russian girls are the best as housewives. Very satisfied. [applause]. They are not bothered as to how much you are earning, what you are doing. They are very satisfied and can live with two-three sarees. Very sweet girls. They are very good-looking. And also from other countries like Romania, Poland; they are very good girls.

I am surprised that Indian girls are very fussy. Some of them want to know how much is the pay of the husband, how much he can earn – very calculating. So we have avoided such marriages. Because you have to fight your life in Sahaja Yoga. So many of you who got married before too, didn’t have much money. But you had faith and everything worked out. So two extremes are there.

[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi.]

I am surprised especially with Indian girls. They put on airs. If they have to put on airs, then they will remain here. And will not go there and dominate. Not at all. They are sinking our country’s name everywhere. You people should please have some understanding.

[The music programme is starting. Break in recording, resumes when Shri Mataji is speaking]

Shri Mataji: There are Indian songs in Indian languages. There are so many Indians who are sitting together here and there like groups. So I think that they should sit with other people one by one and explain to them what these people are singing. Then they will enjoy it more. [Applause].

[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi].

I saw so many people were sleeping off. I think you must take rest in the day time. We have most of our programs in the evening. Tomorrow again, we are going to have music, as Babamama says, from six o'clock, because I'm worried about your dinner now. And day after tomorrow, from nine o'clock in the morning, I'm sorry to say that, but there's price distribution only for Indians. The leaders of the Western countries and Australia and Eastern foreigners, I would say, should come here.The leaders, just to give presents to Indians.

On the twenty-fifth evening there's a puja. We are organizing a very famous drama on Shivaji. There are two hundred actors and actresses in that. We'll try to arrange it here, only. On the twenty-sixth and the kawals are coming on the twenty-seven. M. Rajam on the twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, weddings on twenty-ninth. In the morning, we'll have haldi, and in the evening the marriages.

Most of the marriages have been fixed, but still I'm doubtful about one or two which we'll inform you. You'd better meet people, other people with whom you have been engaged. Try to find out all about it, and then decide. Now there are three, four days. So I hope you do not make a mistake. Just talk to them. And I think you may, most of you will agree. But if you don't, don't hesitate. I'll be very happy. Don't leave it to Me. It's your decision. You shouldn't say, "Of course, if Mother wants, we'll do it". That I will never accept. You have to decide yourself, see for yourself. I've just given a guideline. It's no compulsion, no ruling about it. So, you have to just see for yourself and decide for yourself.
Thank you very much.

[Applause].
