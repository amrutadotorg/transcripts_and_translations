I've gotten so used to it, it's so hard to look back. One thing, I go maybe in retrospect. I couldn't imagine not being married to a Sahaja Yogi. I would not be married otherwise. I only want to be married to a Sahaja Yogi and only to Alan. And the marriage has evolved, and we found out things about each other, especially about ourselves through the process, that were invaluable. For me, it only has to do with Sahaja Yoga to be able to share every Sahaja experience with someone who is right there. This is absolutely a privilege. I can't thank you enough. And for his patience to listen to me when I go on and on. In his manly fashion, he wants to be short and brief. I sometimes go on. So these are little things, but they're very entertaining also.

Lately, I have to tell him I'm so grateful because of how we complement each other. In the beginning, I didn't know this. I thought, oh, Alan is also calm and detached and nothing can move him, whereas I was more bubbly and a bit more temperamental, perhaps. Now, thank God, I have him like a soundboard to witness my things. And then we all come down again nicely. So this is just an example that, over the years, I didn't see this in the beginning. I thought, my goodness, he's a Sahaja Yogi, but he's not so emotional. He's so... whereas I am. So now I know for sure this is very, very good for both of us to balance each other. And we enjoy this. We find it quite humorous most of the time.

So we got married in '87. Let's go back to that point. At that time, it was quite a different situation for me. In 1986, I was still married. That was my first marriage, to someone else. It was a Sahaj marriage. I wasn't involved; Shri Mataji never asked me anything. It was organized by others.

Then, when Shri Mataji came to Vienna in 1986, and also I had a small child who was about a year old at that time, she called me to her room. I had no idea what to expect. There were other Sahaja Yogis in the room. She asked me a few questions about that first marriage, and then she said to me, "I think it's better to divorce." And that took me completely by surprise. I had never asked for that. I had never talked to anyone about this first marriage, except to one person. I don't want to go into details now, but that's what happened. So Shri Mataji helped me there in front of witnesses. She dissolved that first marriage, and I did not ask for it. I was completely surprised, but inside of me, I knew it was the right thing.

A day later, she looked at me and gave me direct advice. She said, "You know, there are many good Sahaja Yogis, many good husbands in Sahaja Yoga." Okay. Why does she say that? And she said it twice, directly in my face. That really startled me because this was all very overwhelming for me, this procedure. I didn't have time to think. But I had the help of brothers and sisters who gently coaxed me to put my name on the marriage list again, which I would have never done without all these experiences. So I said, okay. But of course, I had a child. So I did get my name put on the marriage list, and yes, then I got divorced.

In India, Shri Mataji matched me to Alan. I didn't talk to her; she didn't talk to me personally in India at all. I have a different background than many other Yogis who went there for the first time to get married. So in my heart was just, if it is meant to be, please, this is the Sahaja Yogi who will be solid and who will be kind to my daughter and who will accept her unreservedly. That was my wish. From then on, we can manage.

So I got introduced to Alan. I'm sure brothers, I can't remember... it was a bit exciting. Someone put us in front of each other. So again, I looked at him and I said, well, I didn't feel anything different. I saw Alan for the first time. It was, uh-huh. Okay. Like there was nothing deeply exploding in myself. But we got a little time to talk and I wanted to feel him out, how he felt about my daughter. And that really reassured me that he was very fine. Very good. Very nice. So I said, wow. That convinced me on a level that, well, this is a husband I want because he accepts my daughter. And who would do that? And I felt he was honest there. And so we took it from there.

I tell you, it was such an intense time, just all these things happening, that I can't really remember many details. It would come back to me, of course, how we had to treat each other at the ceremony, how we had to write poetry about each other. I don't think we were the greatest poets. But anyway, in a nutshell, for me, it was just the beginning of an evolving, very beautiful story. And I now every day appreciate more. I don't know why things happen the way they do. I have no idea. At least it's all in Shri Mataji's loving heart. I don't need to know everything. But now it's good. And the main thing, we have two more children. They have been in Sahaja Yoga. They have been brought up. They now take a hiatus and are not currently involved actively in Sahaja Yoga. They respect Sahaja Yoga itself. And I hope it will go on many, many years. That's the main thing.

A little background. I came to Sahaja Yoga in the fall of 1985. I was in Sahaja Yoga for about three months, and then I moved into the ashram in January. And then the following year in December, I left for the India tour. I was actually the only Canadian that was on the whole tour there at the time. I found the tour to be interesting because I didn't know what to expect. Everything was new. Everything was fresh. The vibrations were wonderful. And there were times when it was more difficult. Things were tough. You'd get sick.

And then, of course, I had my name on the marriage list. I remember the leader at that time said maybe I should wait another year. And I said, "No, I want my name on the list this year." I went there and we got matched. Edward Sogstedt introduced us together. And I guess like a lot of people from the West, I had my own fair share of conditioning and expectations. It's one thing to say that you are detached and you will accept whoever Shri Mataji marries you to; it's another thing to deal with the reality. So like Inga said, when I first saw her, I didn't feel one way or the other, whether this is the person or not that I should marry. I just sort of took a wait-and-see attitude. But I do remember distinctly that I was quite happy about the fact that she had a child. I've always really liked all children for that matter, but especially little girls, because I knew that in my family, the dominant tendency was for boys. So I thought, okay, if you get a little girl, that's nice. And the idea or concept that it's someone else's child never took hold of me. For some reason, I felt, okay, they're all God's children. It doesn't matter who biologically they came from. The main thing about children is you just love them and you experience the love they have to give.

So we went along. I had my up periods and I had my down periods. But much like Inga was saying, in retrospect, you see clearly all the reasons Shri Mataji had for putting you together. And I am very thankful to Shri Mataji for matching me with Inga because my one main concern was having a strong yogini by my side in my life. And this is the one thing she's always been. She's been a real rock. She had more experience in Sahaj matters than I did, and I think that she has such strong, positive qualities that I can really see help me to balance and offset my imbalances as well. So we're very happy.

Other than that, we had a very traditional marriage, at least for Sahaj at that time. We grooms all rode on bullock carts, maybe four or so to a cart. And we had the sheets of fire and all the rest of those things. The vibrations were, of course, wonderful. Whenever I put my attention on the vibrations, they were very good for us to be as a match. And then I remember very distinctly Shri Mataji talking before the marriages actually took place. There were all of us that were matched, and some people refused the match. I remember somewhere around two or three women declined. And boy, oh boy, I was really glad I accepted because Shri Mataji really gave it to them left and right.

I know the other thing, of course, I had some doubts, and I know I'm not the only groom like that. I've seen men faint when their marriage is announced, as far as that goes, because you just face all this stuff in yourself. It has very little to do with the person; it's just facing your own stuff. But I also remember very distinctly that I had some very powerful Rocky brothers, people like Gregoire and the leaders of this country and that country and so on, and they were all coming up to me. "Yeah, congratulations. This will be a very good match." And I felt like it would have been nice to discuss things in general without having people just telling me this, encouraging. But all said and done, you see a lot of the reasons inside, and it's the inside things that really count. The yogini is someone that will love you and look after you and vice versa. And someone that's a good mother for your children. All of these qualities that are not found in today's society very much, you see in the gift that Shri Mataji gave you.

And then, oh, we got married again. We had a second marriage. I believe it... I don't know if it's called an Aryan Samaj, but we were married legally in a Hindu ceremony that was arranged, which was a bit strange. That would give us the legal paperwork that we needed in order for Inga to come to America. So a lot of... I don't know if they've done that very many times. I haven't heard of anyone else. We had that ceremony, and so we got married in January and somewhere in May, I believe, Inga was able to make it. So it was really quick to immigrate into Canada. But I would not recommend any Aryan Samaj wedding, unfortunately. It was only adding complications. In the end, I had to pay a bribe to be sent to India so that they would send the certificate.

Oh, we had a honeymoon, which was great. Yeah, we did. That was actually nice. In India. Yeah, in a hotel. It was strange. You sit there and look at each other. It was interesting. You got room service. You could order whatever you want. And your dhobi actually came back cleaner than when you sent it out. So I remember those little things. But it's sure an adventure, and I can only recommend it. You have to go with it. You have to go forward, and it'll work out.

Victoria:
I was saying I just want to know what happened to the 12th groom who didn't have a horse. Did he have to run behind the other horses or did he double up with someone else? But I'm sure we'll get there.

Speaker:
No, he didn't double up. They were very skilled. They weren't skinny horses. They weren't looking very healthy. I can't remember. I have to ask Richard. But everybody got there. Everybody got there.

Victoria:
Excellent. Yeah. So I guess mine kind of fits a little bit later. It was '91. And I was still rather new in Sahaj, had not put my name on the list. I had just heard a talk before going to India, which was the talk about how dare anyone say no to anyone I would match them with to be married in Sahaj. I don't know if anyone had heard that, but it was really a blast. It was like 40 minutes of that. And so for that and other reasons, I just thought, I just want to meditate. I don't want to be putting my attention on that. So I went on the tour without that intention. Then one fine day, I woke up and thought, oh, this Left Nabhi, it's never going to clear. I guess I should get married. But I was kind of envisioning a life of suffering and tapas because that's what I sort of thought Sahaj marriage was at that point. I had only met couples who were rather suffering, tapas-type of couples, and thought, okay, I'll just throw my lot in. And yeah, so I put my name down rather late, as we really discourage people to do.

And as the Divine is always about how Shri Mataji finds exactly the thing for your ascent, for your understanding and widening as a person, for me, it was the year you weren't supposed to say no. She matched me with someone who was kind of a crazy person and obviously not really... well, who was I to say, but he didn't seem like a Sahaja Yogi to me. So there I was matched with this gentleman, and she sent us... sort of the window of the car rolled down. And I think it was Yogi Mahajan who said, "Have you decided yet?" and we had literally just been announced. Like I hadn't even met the person. "You have 24 hours," kind of wagging a finger. And I think Shri Mataji was in the back of the car. And so off we went to get to know each other.

To try to squeeze it into the allotted time, I would just say, I felt there's no way I could marry this person. And yet I can't say no to Shri Mataji. So there's the situation I found myself in. And then the next morning I woke up feeling, okay, come what may, whether I get thrown out of Sahaj, I just can't really marry this person. He just doesn't feel like a Sahaja Yogi. And so he said, "Oh, if you want to say no, that's great, but you have to be the one to tell, because I already got in trouble for saying no to a foreigner. I don't particularly want to marry you either, but I don't want to get the heat for it."

He kind of packed me up on a Jeep or a rickshaw or something and sent me off to the huts where Shri Mataji was staying, trembling all the way. And then I arrived there and someone was just coming out of the place Shri Mataji was staying. "What do you want?" kind of thing. And I said, "I just wanted to see Shri Mataji." "Oh, she's resting. What do you want?" I said, "Just kind of saying no." And then I went to the match, and he said, "Oh, Shri Mataji canceled that ages ago. She said, 'He's not a Sahaja Yogi.' And she'll find you a nice tall boy," or something like that. Because earlier there was one other maya where I was on stage. There were four of us called up at the same time and she was kind of mixing and matching. And I was next to one boy and the leader at the time said, "Oh, but Shri Mataji, these two like each other and they know each other already." It found me next to a very short boy. So she said, "You're very tall, aren't you?" And hence the, "I'll find you a nice tall boy" comment.

So then it was the night before the weddings. There were no more announcements as such. They were just throwing a last call for buying a wedding sari. And I thought, well, I'll just go ask, I guess. So I popped down and asked someone at the side of the stage, "Do you know if there's going to be any more announcements or... just wondering if I should buy a sari or not." And they said, "Oh, haven't you met Christian?" Like as if it was common knowledge that I was matched. "Haven't you met Christian?" I said, "No." And then someone ran off to get Christian and Shri Mataji kind of beckoned for me to come up on the stage and was sort of showing some saris. And then Christian arrived and we have two versions of how it happened. He came and said, "I chose this match myself." And his version is her pointing to a sari and saying, "I chose these saris myself." So whichever one fits into your memory better. But for me, that was just the last little stamp of approval from the Divine. And so, we met and of course it was yes, right away. The weddings were the next day, so there wasn't much time to think.

The last little thing I remember is we were sitting after the marriages on those kind of steps made out of mud, the rise. And we were some steps back, definitely not within hearing distance. And all of a sudden I just heard Shri Mataji say, "Victoria." And she was just doing that with her hand, like come up here. And I did that thing of looking all around, but she definitely said my name. So I sort of hopped down the steps and went up and went to her feet. And she leaned over and said, "I just wanted to tell you that your shawl is on inside out." You know, those shawls where the embroidery is only on one side and it's all kind of loose threads on the other. So she said, "I just want to tell you your shawl is on the wrong way. It's your wedding day. I want you to look your best."

Which was so sweet. And again, that personal attention. And we were one of, at the time, one of the most photographed couples ever. It was just somehow everyone Christian knew had a camera and they were all at every angle, your nose, your ear, your everything. And she also finished with, "I hope someone was there to take pictures of you." So many other stories. I also met my beautiful mother-in-law on that very occasion. So much, very beautiful memories. And again, just the Mother always finding what you need and when you need it. And with all the grace and the love as well.

Rosalind:
Victoria, it's Rosalind here. I don't know if you remember, but I was with you on that tour. We don't see each other much now, but sometimes, when we used to get together, we'd hear little things that had been... I don't remember all of it, but I was with you on that tour.

Victoria:
Oh, yay.

Rosalind:
Yeah. I saw you get married and it was wonderful. Nice to see you.

Victoria:
Yeah. Nice to see you.

Alpana:
Yes. Very beautiful stories. It's really talking about marriages, I think it all comes out so much from the heart. It's been very, very nice hearing all these stories. And nice to see Marie-Louise also. Yes. So with that, we conclude today's session. And for next month, we have, yes, in October, we'll be meeting again. And any other couples or any other yogis who would like to share their wedding stories, that would be very nice. Because, yes, we may have written records, but oral records, they have their own value. The feelings come forth. It's really so precious. And we are recording them and we will share them. So we can conclude. Is there anyone else who would like to make a comment or ask any questions?

Hi, Alpana. There's a question in the chat. "When is the next session? And how do we get the link?"

Alpana:
Okay. So the next session, these sessions are always on the second Wednesday of every month. So if you are interested, on this early yogis group connect chat group, you can also send these invitations to other established yogis. As many established yogis who would like to attend and listen to these beautiful, very precious stories, you're all welcome to come by and join these sessions.

Shalini:
Alpana, just a question. So if somebody is not on that group... Yes. I just sent my phone number to the lady, a sister from Macedonia. And any one of us, I just put my number so you can contact us and we can add you to the cosmos and the bigger group. Maybe somebody is new and not in the group yet. So welcome. And we are hoping to expand and hoping to have more brothers also. It was so nice to hear Inga and both of you. So looking forward to more stories because it shows the complementarity and how the Paramchaitanya through the Adi Shakti knows how to balance out. So I think it would be wonderful to actually have, as we've had in the past, both husband and wife. Yes. So please spread the word and through me, you could connect to any of us. And then you'll be part of this group.

Alpana:
Yes. Thank you so much. And good night to those in Europe. Thank you. Thank you, everybody.
