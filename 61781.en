[The three great mantras are sung by Chaya and Guruji from Sangeet Nirmal Sarita.]
[Bhajan ‘Omkar swarupa’]

Babamama: The next is Brahmachodile. Unlike like year, we had Mis Sandhya [unsure] who was dancing on that song, she is getting married on the 30th, she couldn't come this time. But I am sure your hearts are dancing. So that is more than enough for this wonderful song. Jai Shri Mataji.
[Babamama reads the words for Shri Mataji]

I am finding that the vocal cords are not very clear. I am sure you would like to make your presence felt in the song also. So, could we have you participation in a louder way? If not in a bigger way.
[Bhajan ‘Brahmachodile’]

Shri Mataji knows the pulse so well, that She is- I was about to go, I was about to suggest the song ‘Nirmala’ So, Shri Mataji says, "We should sing Nirmala". But as I said, in the end, we call it the gazzal [unsure] where the tempo increases. I would also want you equally increase in your ‘positivorousness’, your loudness. I must get the feed from you, the feedback from you. You don't have microphones, but we have a complete communication system.

Getting inspired, I am asking Ashok to play his part of the ‘naal’ not dholak. So, that it will add it will give the needed impetus This is just to give you the feelings of a brother towards his sister. The Inspiration has come to me while I was traveling in the train, because that is the only time I possibly get poetic. Maybe the rhythm of the train puts me into that.
And I was so overwhelmed by the song myself, that I had tears in my eyes after I had written it. And this is a very, very sincere effort trying to bring out, about how a brother could feel about a Divine sister.

It says, "Nirmala kithi varana Vigatu ji Stuti" It means, "Oh Nirmala. How much should I praise you? " "Manawala Deitiesa Devachi Anubhut" "Because you are giving us the experience of God. You are making us feel God which in itself is making me so joyous, that I would like to praise you to eternity, Oh Nirmala".
Then it says "Murlica Swarathu Rudaspandacha Laita to Anandacha Sarita to Sagaracha Bharati to". It says that, "Oh Nirmala! You are in the in the tune of the flute. You are in the rhythm of the heartbeat. You are not the heartbeat, but you are in the rhythm of the heartbeat then you are in the joy of joy or when you are the you are in the epitome of joy. And you are also in the happy tide of the ocean".
