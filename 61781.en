[The three great mantras are sung by Chaya and Guruji from Sangeet Nirmal Sarita.]
[Bhajan ‘Omkar swarupa’]

Babamama: The next is Brahmachodile. Unlike like year, we had Mis Sandhya [unsure] who was dancing on that song, she is getting married on the 30th, she couldn't come this time. But I am sure your hearts are dancing. So that is more than enough for this wonderful song. Jai Shri Mataji.
[Babamama reads the words for Shri Mataji]

I am finding that the vocal cords are not very clear. I am sure you would like to make your presence felt in the song also. So, could we have you participation in a louder way? If not in a bigger way.
[Bhajan ‘Brahmachodile’]

Shri Mataji knows the pulse so well, that She is- I was about to go, I was about to suggest the song ‘Nirmala’ So, Shri Mataji says, "We should sing Nirmala". But as I said, in the end, we call it the gazzal [unsure] where the tempo increases. I would also want you equally increase in your ‘positivorousness’, your loudness. I must get the feed from you, the feedback from you. You don't have microphones, but we have a complete communication system.

Getting inspired, I am asking Ashok to play his part of the ‘naal’ not dholak. So, that it will add it will give the needed impetus This is just to give you the feelings of a brother towards his sister. The Inspiration has come to me while I was traveling in the train, because that is the only time I possibly get poetic. Maybe the rhythm of the train puts me into that.
And I was so overwhelmed by the song myself, that I had tears in my eyes after I had written it. And this is a very, very sincere effort trying to bring out, about how a brother could feel about a Divine sister.

It says, "Nirmala kithi varana Vigatu ji Stuti" It means, "Oh Nirmala. How much should I praise you? " "Manawala Deitiesa Devachi Anubhut" "Because you are giving us the experience of God. You are making us feel God which in itself is making me so joyous, that I would like to praise you to eternity, Oh Nirmala".
Then it says "Murlica Swarathu Rudaspandacha Laita to Anandacha Sarita to Sagaracha Bharati to". It says that, "Oh Nirmala! You are in the in the tune of the flute. You are in the rhythm of the heartbeat. You are not the heartbeat, but you are in the rhythm of the heartbeat then you are in the joy of joy or when you are the you are in the epitome of joy. And you are also in the happy tide of the ocean".

There is a "Premasa sapeksha to dharmasa apeksha to karmasa moksha to marmacha Lakshahitu". It says, "You are the connection between the love ‘sapeksha’ is the connection. Then you are also the foundation of all the dharma, all the religion Then you are also the ultimate redemption of karma, the moksha, the redemption of karma. And you are also the aim of ‘marmacha’ principles, you are also the aim of the principles. I'm sorry PLES.
Then It says, "Manavatejya tatvatu nirguna jesatvatu kartavyajya kartutvatu jivanajya astitvatu”. You are the principle again of humanity or you are the essence of humanity and you are also the essence of Nirguna. And you are the ability of the ability". So difficult to translate Marati. But you are the ability of the ability, and you are the very existence of existence You are ability of excellence. Thank you Shri Mataji. You are the ability of excellence and you are the very existence of existence.
Then in the end, being a Musician, I have concluded with, "Sangita tasurattu durytansa dhirattu". You are the note of the music, the divine note of music. You are the "sakat" [unsure] to the deprived. You are the ever-overflowing flood of love, which you are ever prepared to share with everyone. Oh Nirmala! How much should I praise you? " This is the essence of it .
[Applause]

There are many more nights which are going to be young we Guido. So don't be in a hurry for qawwali. We'll have many more qawwalis. Shri Mataji has requested for the Marwa. That is the first ghazal which Belos [Babamama] wrote.
"Na kudakpo dukte, lok beach majdhaar dukte". Would you want the meaning also? All right. This again was written in a train. This time the train had halted. And I was, if I am not offending the Bengalis, I was amongst the stinking ruins of Calcutta, standard, and I didn't know what to do. So I said, all right, I'll write. And this is what flew in. Yes. But this had stopped.

It says, "Na kudakko dukte beach majdhaar dhunte". ‘Na kudha’ is the navigator. In Hindi, we say ‘navik’, or in Marathi we say ‘navik’. The navigator. The ones who are drowning in midstream, those who have been caught in the whirlpool, they always look for the navigator because out of selfish end. Then it says, because of survival also, thank you Shri Mataji. And it says, "Saki ko rind maya kade medhoonte". The ones who are habituated to drinking, they are all the time looking for the bar woman. That is how the concept in India is, that the wine was being served by a bar woman, who is known as ‘saki’. So that the people who are drinking are looking for the bar woman in the bar. "Saki ko rind maya kade medhoonte hain kamsar ko nase beykhte ar dhoonte". Those who are the downtrodden, the afflicted and those who are deficient, they are being sought by the critics, because also the non-believers, those who believe in themselves and therefore they criticize. Those non-believers of God are seeking these downtrodden people. They are also all the time because they want to criticize them and advise them as to what is right and what is wrong.
But we Sahaja Yogis, we are seeking the people who are seeking. We are after the people who are seeking all these things, we are after them. We are seeking those who are real seekers. "Ham ko dekho kyam dhoonne walo ko dhoonte hain".
Then the first answer is, "Vatan parasti mein ham nasle ko mitane inta kam dhoonte". In the eyes of the poet, even patriotism has to go to a particular limit. If you are going to kill somebody, just because he happens to be enemy, according to the poet, it is not a proper thing, because patriotism is all right. But patriotism does not mean that you can kill your own breed. That is not the purpose of patriotism. Patriotism is to show your love for the nation, but not to kill people.
"Is tabahi par siya sad dhan amno hamad, amno hamad hoonte". And on the foundation, such a weak foundation of hatred and mutual distrust, the politicians are looking for peace and tranquility, eternal peace. How is it possible? If the basis is- they boast of achieving total peace and tranquility. Where are the foundations? By perpetuating hatred, and by perpetuating mutual distrust, this being the foundation, they are trying to bring peace. What is a contradict manifestation? This is hypocrisy.
Then it says, "Bandho ko bhatkane zahit karishma dhoonte hain". Those who are false gurus, those who are alleged godmen, in order to mislead their devotees, they are looking for miracles. Bringing out ‘bibhuti’ from their hand, bringing out a Swiss made watch, saying that this is given by God. Now I didn't know Switzerland belonged to God. God lived there but I'm sure Shi Mataji, God was not giving Swiss watches.
Yes, some people's God live in Switzerland in the bank. [Babamama is laughing]

Yes, so, "Bandho ko bhatkane zahit karishma dhoonte hain. Ye karishma ham dikhaan hain bandho ka hai ma dhoonte hain". While people are the God’s men are trying to create sort of confusion in the minds of the disciples by showing miracles. We are trying to show this miracle by merely your surrender, your honest surrender. If there is an honest surrender, the miracle is bound to happen. It is a fait accompli, it is coterminous. These two things are coterminous. If you are having a total surrender, your miracle is achieved. So, one doesn't have to look to exterior for miracles. You have to look within for your miracle and that miracle is bound to happen. Shi Mataji has assured us and we have experienced that miracle. Then, "Gam zada ghabra ke gamse nijad dhoonte hain. Gam zada ghabra ke gamse nijad dhoonte hain. Ye Belos zariya abke pyaar ki janat hoonte hain".
"Gam zada ghabra ke".Those who are afflicted by grief, those who are totally in remorse, in sadness, those people are, they are so, so much oppressed by their grief, that they want. They are seeking redemption from that grief. That they are not in the grief. Those people are, they are so much oppressed by their grief, that they want... they are seeking redemption from that grief. They are trying to get out of that grief. But while Belos that Shi Mataji has created is trying to create a paradise through you people. Jai Shi Mataji.

Guruji has also travelled. He has been travelling for last 48 hours. And as Jose was saying, he was also practicing classical music involuntarily, because of the jerks of the bus. So his voice is slightly affected. But I am sure, with the grace of Shri Mataji, it will open up.

[Cut in the audio]

Shri Mataji: We are going to have just a little presentation of the beautiful gifts that the foreigners have brought for the Indian Sahaja Yogis. And it's very sweet of them to have brought all these beautiful things for you, whatever was possible from all different countries. And whatever was available they have been able to bring it and luckily, everything has reached safe. So I think we should thank them, so give them a hand.
[Applause]
I mean if the foreigners want to be here, they are welcome because they are the ones who have brought all these gifts, and they should see the joy of the people who are here. But if they want to rest, they can go and rest also, it's all right. And now I will tell you one after another. The first we'll have children, very small children, up to say three years or four years at the most. Very small children, if you have any. Or anybody who has small children can come. Without the child also, we'll do.
[Applause]
[The distribution of gifts proceeds]
