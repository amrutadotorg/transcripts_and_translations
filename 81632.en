Reeves came to the door and said, "Oh, hello, come in. We're having a meeting upstairs." So I went up the stairs and looked around to make sure I knew where the exit was, in case things were going to happen.

They said, "Sit down, we're having a meeting." So I sat down on the chair and they started working on me. There were just a few people there. And then I started feeling this energy flowing in my hands. I thought, "Wow." I said, "Yeah, that's it."

Then they started explaining to me what my catches were. They said, "Oh, you're catching because you've been doing lots of reading." I said, "Yeah." I thought, "Wow, these people are really good. They can tell what's happening." I said, "Yeah, I've been doing lots of reading." And they said, "Oh, there's a problem with your mother."

What had happened is I left home and I wasn't in contact with my family. But what I discovered afterwards is that your parents are inside you. And because my mum was worrying about me, I was actually feeling the physical pain. It was a pain like someone had whacked me. I thought it was maybe down to work, because of the plaster, but they said, "No, it's to do with your mother." So I thought, "God, I better ring her up and go and see her and tell her I'm fine," because I was concentrating on finding this thing.

So they explained that to me, and then they said a few more things. I thought, "Wow, that's it." But then I said to myself, "Oh, my God. If I tell anyone, they're going to say I'm completely mad." So I got up out of the chair, said, "Thank you very much," and they said, "Oh, we have it every week. You can come back and see us."

I ran all the way home. And it was a steep hill, and I ran all the way home. I said, "I found it. That's it." I thought, "I found it now." When I went back to see my family, I said, "I can go back to work now because I found it." People were saying to me, "Oh, there's something different about you." I said, "What do you mean?" They said, "There's some change in you. Tell us what it is." I thought, "No, if I say anything to people, they're going to start asking me lots of questions." So I said, "No, no, it's nothing." They said, "No, no, there's something about you. We know there's some change in you." I said, "Yeah, when I find out a bit more, I'll let you know."

In those days, they didn't used to answer many questions. Afterwards, I discovered that I was asking lots of questions which they couldn't answer. I kept asking them questions, and they said, "OK, take this tape. Listen to that." I would come back and say, "I listened to that. Now, have you got any more?" I kept asking them lots of questions. They said, "We don't know." I said, "Who knows?" They said, "Shri Mataji." I said, "When can I see her?" They said, "You can't see her." I said, "What do you mean? Is this a cult or what? What's going on? Why can't I see this lady?"

They said, "Do you want to see her?" I said, "Yes." They said, "Oh, OK. We go and see her every Monday." I said, "What? Would you like to come?" I said, "Of course I want to come. I'm asking you all these questions you can't answer." So they said, "OK. Be here at Sutton. There's a minibus. Jump in the minibus. Go down to London." She must have been at Caxton Hall. I thought, "Wow, yeah. There is just something special about her." I could feel vibrations. I knew it was something.

After a few more weeks, they said, "There's a ceremony we have. It's called a puja." And this one was a Sahasrara Puja. This was the 5th of May in 1981. They said to me, "Would you like to come?" I said, "Yeah, of course. I'd like to come along."

"We've got a minibus. Come down in a minibus with us." I said, "Great." They didn't explain anything to me about where or anything like that. So I got my flask and my packed lunch. I remember they said it was going to be a long day. I turned up at Chelsham Road and sat down in the room. It was packed; there were loads of people there. Shri Mataji's chair was there where it normally is. She gave a speech, and then she said, "All those people who are here for the first time, who come from a country which is not England, can ask for a boon for their country."

I thought, "Wow." I understood what that word meant. You can ask for three wishes. I thought, "Great." I said, "What can I ask for now?" I thought, "Okay." At the time, the Rastafarian movement was growing big. I knew that it wasn't good because I met people in my community who were doing it. They were smoking stuff and going off their heads and all that. I said, "This needs to die down." That was one.

Second one, I said, "They keep telling me that this marijuana is a holy herb, something to do with King David or something. This needs to be neutralized." And then the third one, she said, "I'll tell you what to say." She said, "You should ask that the Pentecostal movement subsides." At the time, they were having busloads of people, coaches, going down from Bristol to London. Billy Graham. It was all people coming back like zombies. She said, "You should say that this needs to be stopped." So that was the third boon. I said that, so that was good.

I'm sitting there. At the time, Gregoire was translating what I was saying to Shri Mataji, because it was a Jamaican accent. Or deep Bristolian, I don't know. But when I was speaking, Gregoire was translating what I actually meant to Shri Mataji. So I sat back down.

I'm sitting there with my hands out, meditating. At the end of the puja, lots of presents were given to Shri Mataji. She took the wrapping off. What I was thinking was, you see those things with the wicks on, with the flame? Looking at her, on her left-hand side, she would undo the wrapping and put it down. And all of a sudden, the wrapping paper caught on fire and started going up to the ceiling. Everyone was in the room, and nobody was moving. And I was thinking, "What's happened? Why is nobody moving? This lady's going to catch on fire." When wrapping paper burns, it's so fast.

I thought, "Oh my God." So I jumped up in the air. I had a really nice brown corduroy jacket, dark brown. I jumped up, ran over, ripped it off my back like that, and just damped down the flames. Put the fire out, and then sat back down. In that time, it was like time stood still. Nobody moved. Nobody said anything. I was thinking, "What's happening with these people?" I just sat back down. Even up to now, all these years later, no one's ever asked me about it. At the time, nobody said, "What were you doing?" And I was thinking, this is... I was there. I just sat back down. I think it was all over in about two seconds. So I just sat back down. And then I was thinking, "Wow, these people are slightly different. I'll stick with it." So that was my first... that was happening within two months. And that was my sort of interaction.

Carol Garrido

Where was I at? Well, I was in Sheffield at the time. I think what happened really, in retrospect, is that I walked... I was studying Landscape Architecture in Sheffield, and I walked past this bookshop where they sold incense and all sorts of things. I walked back again because I saw this picture on the door. It was of a lady with long hair. I just sort of read what was underneath—to this day, I can't remember what it was—but I saw the picture and then I just walked on. I forgot all about it.

Before that, I would never be someone who was looking, reading anything that was unusual or doing anything like that. I come from a very Christian background. But after that incident of seeing Mother's picture, which it was, I started reading things and allowing myself to seek. And even to go back and read the Bible as though I was just reading it for my own sake, rather than anything else. Then I came across a book by Gurdjieff, who's someone I had never heard of or didn't know anything about. But inside it, it said you need a guru somewhere. So I thought, "Oh my God, yes. I need a guru."

So I was looking. I started going back to church because I'd stopped doing that. Going to the Baha'is because my brother was trying that. And somebody in the house that I was living in said, "Oh, we've gone to this thing. You'd be good at that. You're looking around, you're asking questions. Come to this." So we went to this public program in Sheffield. Ray Harris was talking, and he was talking about evolution and everything. I thought, "Oh, this is interesting." Then they put this tape of Mother on, and Mother started talking about how God made this beautiful world and just put rivers here and trees there and mountains here just to make it beautiful. And I thought, "Hmm. That's interesting," because I was studying landscape architecture and trying to design things. I thought, "Well, that sounds good."

Then I was worked on. I think it was John Glover and Graham's wife, Gail Pottinger. And they worked on me, asking, "What are you feeling? What are you feeling? Are you feeling the cool breeze on your hands or on your head?" I couldn't feel anything. And then I started to cry, because I was in an emotional place at that time. They said, "But can you feel anything else?" I said, "Yes, I can feel this cool coming down on my knees." "Oh, that's good. That's good." I thought, "Good."

Then, I went home. Oh, yes. And they asked me, "Why do you think we're here?" Ray said, "Why do you think we're here?" I said, "We're here to enjoy." Because, strangely enough, before I'd come for the program, I had been sitting under a tree somewhere thinking, "Why are we here?" And this thought had come into my head from somewhere: we're here to enjoy. And I was so not enjoying myself at that time. I thought, "This is very strange." Then Ray asked me, and he said, "Yes, yes, yes. That's what we're here for. We're here to enjoy."

There was Mother's photograph, a puja photo, at the meeting. And I kept saying to John Glover, "Who is this lady?" because I felt that coming from a Christian background, an icon... it's a photo and you're all sort of... "Who is this lady?" I kept wanting to know who this lady was.

Eventually, in a few months' time—I think it was in the summer that I came to the program in Sheffield, maybe two or three months later—we all went down to a puja in Chelsham Road. Mother was there sitting by the fireplace, and I was almost at the back. It was very tight, with a million people around. I was just looking at Mother and saying, "Mother, who are you? Who are you?" And coming back home and looking at Mother's photograph again and thinking, "Well, I know who you are."

Then going again to the next puja. At the first puja I went to Mother's feet when she asked for new people to come. And she said, "What are you doing? Your liver's so bad." I said, "Architecture or landscape architecture." She told us to say, "Mother, you're the architect of all architects." You say that three times and suddenly you feel,
whew
, it's all cleared out.

After the second puja, I asked her about the Baha'is. She said, "Well, they do drink and smoke." And I thought, "Hmm, that's an interesting answer." I knew that because my brother, who was a Baha'i, couldn't give up smoking. After coming back from that puja, I just felt, "Well, I just love you." And that was really it for me.

Later on, I went to a meeting at somebody's house, and Mrs. Harris, Ray's mum, was there. There was this big photo of Mother with the blue sari. People were talking about Shri Mataji, and Mrs. Harris just sat there. She said, "Well, you know that they do say she might be the Virgin Mary." And I sort of thought, "Yes." I took this on board and thought, "Yes, this, wow, this is a possibility." And I think just that was it, really.

Kay McHugh

I got my realization in Australia, but I very soon came to England about four or five months after. I never thought of myself as a seeker. Somebody told me afterwards, "I always picked you as a seeker." I thought, "What's a seeker?" I didn't even know the word guru. At that stage, my lifestyle was... you'd have everything you'd think you'd want in a nice flat overlooking the harbor in Sydney, a fast car, and a job where you're traveling around the world. But there was a big hole in my life. I reached that emotional state where everything was starting to fall apart and go wrong.

I had come back from a long-haul trip, and I was tired. I was just going into the supermarket to get some milk and stock up. This girl who lived quite near my flat, who I knew very vaguely—she was often asking me to parties and things, and I thought she was crazy; I'd never gone to her parties—she said, "Oh, how are you going?" And I went, "Oh, God, my life is like this." So I'm having this great whinge to her, and she's banging me on my left shoulder the whole time. I thought, "Why is she hitting me on the left shoulder?" I was feeling so tired, having a nice whinge.

She said, "What you need is this lady." And she pulled her pendant up like this. And I went, "Oh, okay then." I thought, "Nice." She said, "You come to my house on Sunday night." This was a Friday, the 1st of August, 1980, I remember. And I said, "Okay." So having turned down parties and things she'd invited me to before, suddenly I said out of spontaneity, "Yes, I'll come." I remember walking to the dairy department to get my milk and standing there thinking, "I don't feel tired anymore." I felt like this rush of energy. I felt fantastic. It was amazing.

I never had another cigarette; I was wanting to give up smoking. I never had another cigarette. I went home and wrote these Dear John letters and sorted out all my love life and stuff. I had no idea what was happening. Everything was just suddenly falling into place. All I had seen was Mother's picture on the pendant.

Then I went to her place on the Sunday and they sat me down in the kitchen, put Mother's picture there, and said, "Put your hands out." And I thought, "What?" I thought, "I knew I shouldn't have come to this crazy woman's place." They were knitting away and saying, "Oh, she's got it." I'm thinking, "Well..." I said, "Look at her eyes. Look at this. Can you feel it?" I thought, "No, I can't feel anything." Anyhow, they gave me this picture and sent me home and she said, "By the way, she's God." And I've gone, "Okay."

I do remember putting that official black and white photograph of Shri Mataji down by the gear stick of my car and driving home and thinking, "Well, who am I to say she's not?" So I give myself credit for having an open mind. Because she told me that straight off, I thought it's between her and I and we have to work this out. If I'd come to a public program, listened to a lecture, or looked at the Sahaja Yogis around me, I would have gone, "No, no, no, they're all crazy."

To me, the seeking... I didn't even know the word guru. It was more that I had to have the answer this lifetime. That's all I knew. I didn't want to sit and be 80 years old with that blank look on my face, thinking it's all over and I still don't know the answer. I thought, "I'm not dying till I get the answer."

And of course, I always knew that something special was going to happen to me when I was 35. I was always going on about turning 35, and they said, "What's so special about that?" I'd gone, "I don't know. It's just that that's when I'm going to be complete. I'll be complete at 35." They said, "What do you mean?" I thought, "I don't know what I mean, but it's going to be complete." Of course, it was my 35th year that I got my realization.

But I had made such a fuss about turning 35 that my sister had given me a surprise birthday party, which was the most disastrous night of my life. She'd just gone through my address book and asked everybody. I said, "Why did you do this? It was horrible. You had the plumber there, people I never wanted to meet." It was just such a dreadful night. She said, "Well, you've made such a fuss about turning 35 all your life, I thought we'd better do something special for you." But it was some months later that I actually got my birthday present. It was the 1st of August, 1980. Four months later, I was transferred in my job to London, which was a miracle, orchestrated by Shri Mataji from beginning to end. So I guess I was a seeker... on planes. I always thought I'd find it somewhere in the next port. The answer would be somewhere else. But it was always there.

I just want to say that I was brought up as a Catholic, and I felt that was not it. In the church, I felt quite like an intruder. So I became a communist. The communism wasn't very good either, so I didn't really know what I wanted. I didn't think I was a seeker, but obviously I was, because people didn't seem to make sense. They were living all the time with contradictions in their lives, and I couldn't make out what it was all about.

One day, I cycled to the lake. It was five o'clock in the morning, and I was quite tired because it was a long drive. I just stretched on the ground. The sun was rising, the daisies were growing around, and I just suddenly became one with nature. I instantly thought, "Well, this is God," because it was such a strong experience.

I went home and announced to everybody that God really exists. I was trying to come to England for seven years, but I was refused a passport. After this experience, everything started to happen very quickly in my life, so I could actually get the passport and come to England. It was in 1977 when I came.

Then I came across different seeking books. I bought lots of them, and I was going to different meditation groups. I was training to be a Hatha Yoga teacher. A week before I came to the program in Caxton Hall, various people were meeting me at random, looking at my hands, and saying, "You really have healing hands." I thought, "Well, I don't think so, but if they say so." Then a friend of mine came to my flat and said, "I met this lady. She healed my back. She's really a great healer." So I thought maybe I'd better come along and check it out.

I came to Caxton Hall, and it was quite amazing. She was wearing a white sari, and there were these two big Indian standing lamps burning on both sides of her. She looked very majestic and very powerful. She gave a talk, and then she just asked us to go into meditation. I had this very strong experience, like a fountain just opened at the base of my spine and went really through my stomach and up. I was completely shaken by the experience.

Then I went to her feet. Because I had burning in my heart—obviously, I was doing hatha yoga—I was thinking, "What is this burning?" Mataji just looked at me and she said, "Your problem is here." She was very sweet. She was saying, "Do you catch colds?" I was thinking, "Colds? Yes, I do." And she was saying, "You are very joyful," because I was smiling, and she was smiling. Then I just knew. I just knew I had arrived at my destination.

But the interesting thing was that the next day, I started to feel very strange. I was walking along the street and I felt that I was walking just like she did. I thought, "Am I ever going to be myself again?" because I was moving how she did, and it was quite strange. Later on, I found out that Shri Mataji says that we are all one, so we are in her body. From that perspective, I now understand that through this self-realization, I was taken by Shri Mataji into her body.

Of course, then I tried to find out about the ashram. It was quite impossible for me to do because nobody wanted to give me the address. Douglas was operating the recording equipment, so at the next meeting, because Shri Mataji wasn't there, I said to him, "Maybe I can help you." He said, "All right." Then I said, "By the way, do you know the address of the ashram?" He just looked at me. He gave me Kundalini, and he says, "I suppose I can give it to you."

So I went to the ashram the following week. And then there was the Sahasrara Puja, 1980. I just thought I was just popping in, but the puja started, so I stayed. To my great surprise, Shri Mataji called me to do the puja. It went on for quite a while. But then it was strange, because after the puja, there was a havan, which is normally the other way around. Shri Mataji asked me to sit and do the havan with everybody else.

The havan was a thousand names with translations, so it took about four hours. After 20 minutes, I started to feel amazing, but at the same time, things were clearing up. I started to feel my legs were not really up to it. I looked outside the window and it was getting dark, but I had come at nine o'clock in the morning. Then there was a music program after the havan. By the time I left, I felt very, very clear inside. I think ever since, I never missed any programs or any pujas. I couldn't have enough of them.

Luis Garrido

I think I was going mad, probably. And very sick. But sometimes I was well; it was on and off. Of course, meeting Mother is the greatest day of my life. It's something for which, still today, I'm very thankful to God to have that chance to meet Shri Mataji, and also the chance to somehow understand who she is at that meeting. Otherwise, I could have lost everything because Shri Mataji was going to go away the next day. So time was short. I think Shri Mataji and God made it easy for me. It had to be such that I had to understand it there and then.

In preparation, before meeting Mother, I was on a motorbike and had a head-on collision with a car. The moment the motorbike hit the car, my body was up in the air. During that time, I knew I was going to die. In that split second, I saw my whole life, since I was born—something one cannot remember as a baby—up to that day. Then I saw my own funeral. I saw my parents weeping over my body. Each and every person I had met in my whole life was there. An angel up in the air told me, "What a big waste of a life. A life which really had a purpose."

The next thing I hear, a big bang. This was the bang of my helmet on top of the bonnet of the car. And then I fell on the floor. Not a scratch. Nothing. A very strange feeling. To see one's whole life from beginning to end, including my own funeral, in less than a split second. So that was like an awakening experience.

Then one day I was in bed at 4 a.m. My parents arrived home. They woke me up and showed me a glance of the picture of Shri Mataji. They said, "Look, look at what we have found." I said, "Wow," and went to sleep. In those days, because I was very ill, I was always praying for the dove of the Holy Ghost to land on top of my head. I knew I needed divine salvation; there was no way I could get out of that situation. But even though I prayed and prayed, nothing happens, as you probably know from experience. But that night, after seeing a glance of Shri Mataji, when I woke up, there was a voice in my head. The voice of Christ. And the words were, "I was hungry and you didn't give me any food. I was naked and you gave me no clothes. I was ill, you didn't come to see me. I was in jail and you didn't come to see me either."

Those words kept coming in my mind, very loud. I knew, "Oh my goodness, these are the words of Christ." Then I realized, my cousin was in jail and I had refused to go and see him for two years. He was my age, but he had done some drug offenses and I said, "No way, I'm not going to visit him." Then I realized what a selfish person I am, not minding the fact I'm hurting my parents, my aunt, my cousin. I just don't care for other people. All I care for is myself.

Luckily, I had this thought: "I want to go and see my cousin in jail at last." My parents said, "My God, what happened to you? Did you have an epiphany? We've been telling you this for two years." I said, "I don't know. I have to go and see him today." That was my luck, because I went to see my cousin in jail that day for the first time, and on the way back, my parents went to see Shri Mataji again. So I was with them. That was my chance at last to see Shri Mataji.

However, my girlfriend was an atheist and a communist, so she refused to go. Shri Mataji was staying in a place where you had to go up many stone steps. I don't know what came to me. I said, "Okay, you have to go. That's it." So I forced her up the steps, really by force. It was hurting her arm. I dragged her up all the way, so she had to come as well.

We arrived there and were sitting in a small room. This was like an old castle, a very ancient building. The room where they told us to wait for Mother had no windows. To go into the room, you have to go down some little stone steps. The door is so small, like in ancient buildings, that to go inside you have to bend down. Once you are in the room, it's like a cell. You cannot get out. We were waiting there for Shri Mataji. She was having a siesta. All my family was with me there in that room.

Then I saw some people passing through. I thought, "I know those guys. False gurus." I couldn't believe I would come to a place like this to meet these guys. I jumped out of that room and went after them. As I went after them, I saw a lady coming out of a room, totally disheveled. The sari was not... Mother had just come out of siesta. I saw Mother from a distance and had the same motorbike experience. Instead of seeing my present life, I saw all my past lives and could see that Shri Mataji had been my personal mother all my lives. That's what that vision gave. Mother made it very easy for me to know that she is the mother of the universe. I knew I had met Christ at last. It was an emergency because Mother was going away the next day.

Mother came to the little room where we were standing with my family. She looked, and I was back there in the room, sitting next to my parents and my girlfriend. The first thing Shri Mataji said was, pointing at my girlfriend, "Who is that woman? What is she doing here?" I lost my tongue. Shri Mataji looked at me. "You can translate." She knew that I knew English. I had been studying English for two years. I was really amazed. My goodness, she even knows that. "Who is that woman? What is she doing here?"

I couldn't find the word. I said, "My girlfriend." "My what?" "My girlfriend." "No, no, I don't know girlfriend. That doesn't exist. It's indecent. It's absurd. It's obscene." Then she asked, "Do you really love her?" Big silence. I couldn't say it, because I didn't. You see how Mother knew everything. "If you don't love her, then stop it. It's indecent. It's very gross. It's appalling." That was the introduction.

Then she went to work on my relatives who also had diseases. She came again. "Come on, you translate." So I moved next to Mother to translate. Then Mother gave realization. After realization, Mother decided to work on each and every person, and people made a queue. I was in a rush to go and be treated by Mother. So every time my turn came, Mother said, "To the back of the queue." I went to the back of the queue. Then I lost patience and I started jumping the queue. I appeared again. "Sir, go to the back of the queue." Two or three times Mother sent me to the back of the queue. At last, there was no one left. Only me.

Mother worked on me. I was so ill that I can't measure time in those situations, but Mother must have worked on me for 40 minutes or so. It was serious. I was the last one, otherwise the people in the queue would have had to wait so long. At the end of those 40 minutes, suddenly without telling me, she did a neck click. Boom. She twisted my neck to one side. Boom. Big noise in the spine. It was incredible. Then suddenly, bang, she clicked my head in the opposite direction. Then, without telling me, she picked up from her handbag a thing called Netranjan, a very strong eye medicine. She put a massive amount in each eye. At that moment I went blind. Totally blind. But it was so blissful that I said, "I don't mind. I like it. This is fantastic." That was the strongest experience of self-realization I cannot describe, even though I was blind.

By now it was about 2 a.m. She said, "I'm going to Spain tomorrow. So if you want to see me, come very, very first thing in the morning before I go to take the flight." I said, "Fine, I'll come, of course." It was already 2 a.m. "What time shall I come?" She said, "Very early, very early. Early morning, please come." I said, "Yes, early, but exactly what hour?" She said, "Well, early, just come early." I said, "Yes, I understand, but exactly what hour, please?" I thought, this is very strange. "I don't want to come so early to wake you up or disturb you. What time do you get up?" I asked Mother. Mother said, "I get up at 4 a.m." "Shall I come after you get up?" "Yes." "So that means 4 a.m., isn't it?" "Yes."

So I came at 4 a.m., except I didn't manage to make it. My motorbike broke down, ran out of petrol, so I had to run all the way to try and reach there at 4 a.m. I arrived at 5 a.m., pouring in sweat. I banged on the door. Maria Amelia came and opened it, dressed in her pajamas. "What happened to you?" I was pouring sweat, my suit was totally drenched. I had run for an hour to be on time. I was one hour late. "I'm very late to see Mother. It's 5 a.m. I'm here now. Tell her that I've just arrived."

She said, "You see, you need to meditate. So sit down." "Okay, so how do I meditate?" "Very simple. You see that photograph there? You just look at it." I was really offended. "I'm here to see the lady herself, and you are giving me a photograph. Is this what you call meditation?" She said, "Try it." Well, I tried it. And that really was a very special meditation, even without Mother in person. I must have stayed one hour in meditation. Then I got up. I didn't know what to do, so I cooked Mother breakfast. I cooked all the wrong diet, of course, because Shri Mataji was on a special diet. Everything I cooked was wrong. So Maria Amélia said, "I'm sorry, but you better eat it." I said, "No way. Give it to her and tell her this is a Portuguese breakfast. She might like it." Maria Amélia said, "All right, fair enough." She took the breakfast to Shri Mataji, and Shri Mataji ate the whole Portuguese breakfast, even though it was not at all her diet. That was also a special moment.

At last, Shri Mataji met me and she said, "So now can you feel the vibrations?" because I had been meditating. I said, "No." So Shri Mataji, sitting from a distance of about three meters, said, "All right, what about now? Can you feel the vibrations?" She was throwing the vibrations at me. My God, that was like a cool breeze and a big wind. And I said, "No." Then she started blowing it. Every time she blew it, it was like having a bath. "Can you feel the vibrations?" I said, "No." By then, Maria Amélia was getting very irritated. "Come on, come on. What's wrong with you?" And Mother kept saying, "All right, let's try again." She would blow the vibrations. "Can you feel the vibrations?" I said, "No." Of course I was feeling it. Mother said, "I know you can feel it." I said, "It's not vibrating. I'm waiting for it to actually vibrate and shake." Mother said, "Oh, I see. It's a translation problem." The word vibration in Portuguese, you expect it to vibrate.

So when I admitted, "Yes, I can feel the vibrations," Mother said, "In that case, you can come with me to the airport. We'll take you in my car." So great, I'll come to the airport with Mother. As Mother entered the car, everybody got in. I was just getting inside, and the dog gets inside and takes my place, sits next to Mother. A big dog, where I was supposed to sit. She picks the dog by the collar and starts pushing it out of the car. And the dog went,
grrr
, really at Mother's hand. Mother pushed again, and the dog,
grrr
. Then she looked at me. "Well, Luis, you see, I tried. I did my best. The thing is that this dog also recognized me. There's nothing I can do. Why don't you take the bus?"

So I went to the bus. I didn't have any money, and my motorbike ran out of petrol miles away. I really felt stupid, waiting for the bus without any money to go to the airport. But that's what Mother told me to do. Suddenly comes another Sahaja Yogi. I thought, "Oh my God, this is the solution. Have you got a bit of spare change? I need to go to the airport." They looked in their pockets. "Good gracious, I don't even have enough to go on the bus myself." "Okay, well, what shall we do?" "Well, Mother told you to go by bus. You go by bus." Okay, fine. I wait a bit longer. Third Sahaja Yogi comes. "Have you got a bit of spare money?" They check their pockets. "Good gracious, I don't have enough money for myself also." Three Sahaja Yogis now, if you count me, all waiting for the bus to go to the airport without money. I thought, "This is mad. We need to do something about it." They told me, "Oh, no. That's not how it works. You don't worry about things. You just give it a bandhan." "Really? And that's how you go on the bus without money?" "Yes, you just give it a bandhan."

I gave it a bandhan. Suddenly, one of the yogis, he was berserk. He sees a taxi passing through. "I know that guy!" He stops the taxi. "This guy is a good friend of my brother," he said. "Okay, let's get in. We are lucky. What a miracle." We go in the taxi. They start talking. In Portugal, the taxi drivers usually have a cricket bat under the seat. If you don't pay the fare, you get a headache. I said, "We are going to die. One of us is going to die today." They said, "Oh, no. In Sahaj, this is not how you do things. You just give it a bandhan." I said, "Really?"

So we gave lots of bandhans. We had waited about 40 minutes at the bus stop. We must have started about 40 minutes after Mother. I thought, "We are going for our death now. This is the day." We arrive at the airport. Now what are we going to say? I said, "Shall we all run away? Each one in a different direction." They said, "No, no, no. We just give it a bandhan. We have to have faith." We gave it another bandhan. The taxi stops. We look to the car next door. It was the car of Shri Mataji. Inside the car, there was a very rich doctor. He paid for the taxi. Dr. Rustam. There was really a close brush with death again.

At the airport, Shri Mataji worked on a man who was going bald. She rubbed some of the amla hair oil on the head of that man. I felt jealous. I was getting bald also. I wished Mother had given me a bit of that oil on my head, but I couldn't say it. Mother was about to leave. Later on, Maria Amelia comes back. "Oh, look, Mother gave you this bottle of amla oil for you." You see that even small thoughts, she knew everything.

Linda Williams

I've told all my stories in the book. I was always a seeker from early childhood. I remember when I was a kid, someone asked, "What do you want to do when you grow up?" expecting me to say, "Marry a rich man," because that's what people were supposed to do when I was young. And I said, "I want to find God. I want to give that wisdom of God to others." Of course, they thought I was quite mad.

Then I remember when I was a bit older, there's that wonderful thing in the Bible where Lord Jesus gets stuck in the temple. He has these discussions with the people in the temple and his family can't find him. And he says, "Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?" That also was very much my mantra as a child. I was always seeking, even when I was 10 or 12 years old.

I think I'm probably the oldest person in the room here, but I grew up just after the Second World War. I remember the first things I saw in the newspaper were these photos of atom bombs going off. If you grew up with that being drummed into your head—the fact that we were about to go bang—it did something to you if you were a thinking person. We used to have these lectures at school about what to do when the bomb went off. I think that was one of the things that caused the whole hippie generation; we realised something had got to give, something had got to change. An awful lot of us grew up feeling that way.

So I thought I was going to find realisation—I was always looking for Self-Realisation—at university. I tried philosophy at London University, but luckily my professor was a very sensible man. He said, "You're looking for a philosophy of life. You will never find it at London University. Go and do a degree that doesn't impinge on your seeking." I remember him actually using that word, "seeking."

Well, then things went from bad to worse because, unfortunately, everybody basically got caught by something. I got caught by drugs and I got caught by false gurus. I got caught by the TM. But I realised in about 1978 that it was wrong. By that time, I had this place in Scotland which had actually been an academy where they did all these ghastly things. But anyway, we kicked these people out.

I was desperately, desperately seeking and went to an astrologer. Not something I usually do, but I was pretty desperate at that time. I was a bit like John and his macrobiotics and stuff; I was trying everything. This guy was really strange because he said, "Is there any question you want to ask?" And I said, "Yes, I want to know if I'll ever get my Self-Realisation in this lifetime." He looked at the chart—he was an Indian Vedic astrologer—and he said, "Yes. June the 8th next year."

So I kind of forgot about that. Then I was reading all the scriptures; I went through them one by one. I was reading the Srimad Devi Bhagavatam, which is the stories of the Goddess. At this time, I had a £350,000 bankruptcy court case against me because we'd kicked the TM out and they'd ripped us off big time and were trying to bankrupt us. And it said—and I've never found these words again—"If you say these three names of the Goddess, help will come within a day."

The next day, a letter came through the post. I was living in Perthshire, Scotland. It was a letter from David Prole with a photograph of Shri Mataji, the classic photo. He just said, "You must come and see this lady. She is your only hope." He hadn't actually met Mother, but he'd been to a public programme in Caxton Hall. He enclosed a cheque for the train fare "because I know you haven't got any money," which was pretty nice of David because he was also going through bankruptcy. It seemed to be the name of the game for us at that time. So anyway, there was David who'd given me his probably last £35.

Well, things got interesting after that. I had to take the train from Rannoch Moor, which was a funny little station on the West Highland line, down to Glasgow. Then I had to change stations. I was due to meet Mother at the home of Maria, the Greek lady, just outside Bedford. I had to take the train to Bedford and then I was going to be taken to her house.

So I get to Rannoch station and there was this one man who was the porter, the station master, and everything else combined in the middle of this tiny station on the moor. I said, "I've got to get to Birmingham." And he said, "Well, you're not going to make it because the train from Fort William is three-quarters of an hour late. It's going to be later by the time it gets to Glasgow." I said, "I've just got to make that train. I've got a really important meeting." So he said, "Well, don't worry. I'm the station master of Rannoch, although I'm the only person here. I'm going to phone Glasgow, the station for the trains going south. I'll tell them that there's a really important person and that you've got to hold the train." This was in the days when British Rail owned the railway, and they did not hold trains for nobody.

Anyway, I get to Glasgow and I took a taxi across to the other station. I get to the barrier and the ticket collector said, "Are you the lady from Rannoch?" I said, "Yes." He said, "You get on that train. They'll have your guts for garters if they know who you are." This entire express train had been held up for an hour for me. So at this point, I knew something unusual was happening.

Then I got to Birmingham station and Balan picked me up in his funny little red Mini. He drove me very sweetly and kindly to Maria's house. It was a lovely summer day—June the 8th, of course. I didn't realise this till afterwards. I remember the door of her living room was open. It was smaller than this living room; she had a sort of garden door at the back. Felicity was there, and I remember sort of hovering at the back. I just looked at Mother. She was sitting on the sofa with the window behind her, wearing a beautiful red sari. She had so much hair in those days. And I just remember thinking, "My God, this is who I've been looking for all my life. What went wrong? Where did I get delayed?" And I just thought, "This is the one."

She just said, "Come here." I remember walking straight up to her, kneeling at her feet, and putting my forehead on her feet, which I did. Then she would put her toes up a little bit, indicating for you to sit up in front of her. While I had my head on her feet—forget Chakra charts, forget the introductory talks, it was just straight to Mother's feet—I saw this image of a lady riding on a tiger with this wonderful hair and red sari and with all these weapons in her hands. You see, it was Durga. I sort of realized because I knew quite a bit about the Indian tradition.

Mother said to me, "What did you see?" And I described it. I said, "I saw a lady on a tiger and she had all these weapons and this wonderful hair and she had this red sari." She looked at me and she said, "Hmm, yes. That's me. But in another lifetime. You're very super-conscious." And that was my introduction to Sahaja Yoga. So I had no problems like most of the people in this room with realizing who I was in front of. But there were considerable problems after that.

I would like to say one thing about Grishna, actually, which came to my head. When we got Chelsham Road sometime later, I had my money down to £150. Literally, I bought that place for cash with 10p in the bank because, again, there was this bankruptcy case sitting on my head. But somehow I managed to get enough money to buy Chelsham Road for cash. It was £41,000. It was rather cheap, no matter what it's worth today.

And none of us had any money. Shri Mataji wanted to come, you see, because we had this Bhoomi Puja, and we just didn't have the money for food. I clearly remember sitting around the kitchen table upstairs there and saying, "What are we going to do? We haven't got any money. We've got to buy enough for a meal because people are coming and Mother's going to expect a meal." And Grishna disappeared that afternoon. I remember you coming back and putting £100 on the table, which was quite a lot of money in 1980. And it was enough for us to buy the food. I said, "Grishna, where on earth did you get that money?" And Grishna said, "Well, I took my bracelets to the gold exchange." And of all of us, you were the one who came up with the money for that first food. I shall never forget that. I thought, "My God, here's a real Sahaja Yogi." I was blessed with a bit of money to buy the place, although I had no money ever for food. I bought the house, but Grishna was the one who really came up trumps. And I shall never forget that moment.

Interviewer

That's a fantastic story. One of the things that I think is particularly interesting about your generation is this blessing, if you like, to live alongside the Goddess as the Mother. To us, it's quite an alien experience, having God mothering you, in effect, cooking for you and looking after you. What's that like? Do any of you have any particular experiences where it dawned on you that this was God in a special way you hadn't realized before?

Unidentified Speaker 1

I've got one. It was when Mother was at Ashley Gardens. She used to work on me an enormous amount. At one point she said to somebody else, not me, that I was the worst damaged person she'd ever met. Mother, in her infinite compassion, used to have me around and work on me. I remember she used to sort of sit with her foot on my back while she'd be on the phone or reading a paper, and she would move her foot around.

I was sitting on the floor, and she was on her sofa with the window behind her. I remember thinking, "Mother, here you are, you're looking beautiful, and behind you is the sky, and the sky is actually infinite. It goes on forever." She picked up my thought, looked at me, and said, "Yes. What you see is Mataji, but what is behind is vast." That's the story.

Unidentified Speaker 2

She met me... each time she met me, she used to kiss me or hug me. And I just took it for granted. I was so heartbroken when it stopped. Because after a while, well, I had to be a grown-up girl, not needing any more of Mother's attention and love. But it was quite extraordinary, because I felt I had really found my real mother. It was a very, very personal feeling I had. I needed that very badly, and Mother somehow knew that.

Unidentified Speaker 3

Mother used to cook for us, and she used to do everything for us, really. When we went to Stonehenge, she bought us all ice creams. We traveled with her in the back of her car to public programs. When I first came, it was such a normal thing to do. She used to be so, so sweet. You felt she knew exactly what you were feeling, what you were thinking. And she would respond to you on a different level. You just knew that she was just like your mother. You would imagine the best mother you could ever have, who knew exactly what you wanted, exactly what you needed. It was an ideal. For me, it was very moving because I never had this when I was growing up. So it was such a new experience, and I really felt like I was reliving my childhood again. I was really being looked after in many ways.

Unidentified Speaker 4

Yeah, she'd be spoiling us all the time. She was more like my mother than my mother. I remember many times calling her "Mum" by mistake. But she'd know how to touch your heart. Just the way she'd say your name would spark something in you to melt your heart. She just knew. You can't really put it into words, but that love was there very strongly. And I feel that we all really needed that.

Interviewer

Derek must have quite a lot of stories from building various houses in various parts of the universe. The ones I've heard have been hilarious. Derek, maybe you've got one.

Derek

Yes. A really nice story happened in '98, in Cabella. Somebody wanted to be in charge, but Shri Mataji had said to him, "You should just do carpentry." He'd taken it badly and disappeared. So the next morning I had to go and see Shri Mataji. I walked up the stairs and I knew what was going to happen. I had an old photograph of how the house was. I walked up the stairs and she was sitting outside her room, by the two double doors.

Shri Mataji's face was completely drained. For two weeks all her windows were boarded up with plastic; she couldn't see any light. I came up and she said, "You see that angel on the wall there?" There were some plaster mouldings being put up. And she said, "John put that there. And I can see the love pouring off of this little statue." I was looking; I couldn't see anything pouring off, but she was saying that there was all this love pouring from this particular angel.

Then she said to me, "See the scaffold outside? The scaffold has to come down or something's going to happen." And immediately I thought, "Oh my God." It was like I just imagined apocalypse. The whole of creation is going to be destroyed. It was like being in a movie. You see something all beautiful and then suddenly, there's going to be a disaster. When she's talking about the Ganas or the deities, she always says "they." So she said, "They say you have to do the job." And I'm thinking, "Oh my God, the whole of everything rested on my shoulders." She said, "This scaffold has to come down. I want you to do this for me." And I was like, "Yes, Your Majesty."

Time stopped still. I had a photograph in my pocket. The way the people were designing it was all wrong, which I knew. So I took the photograph out and I said, "Your Majesty, I think if we redesign this plan this way, it will work better." She said, "Yeah, go ahead. No problem." I put the photograph in the back of my pocket and thought, "Wow. This is something which has got to be accomplished."

In the end, everything worked out. But I was just thinking of how the two things happened at the same time, within a few seconds. After it was all resolved, people were phoning up from all over the world, saying, "Fergie, what's going on? Something's happened in the castle." I said, "What do you mean?" They said, "Yeah, yeah, tell us, there's something going on." Because our yogis are quite sensitive. I was trying to fob them off. "Nothing." "No, no, no, tell us." I explained the story of what happened, and they were saying, "Oh, wow." Something had happened which was part of a historical context.

Unidentified Speaker 5

Could I just say something in connection with what Derek is saying? It was like that. We didn't quite know what was going on on the subtle level, and very often it was very, very intense. Sometimes Mother used to say what the deities were happy about and what they were not, and the Ganas as well. You didn't know from one moment to the next where the fun stops and the serious thing starts, because they were together.

It was so intense on a very, very deep level. So, it was fun, but it was also very hard to be in Mother's presence when her aspect of the Goddess fighting the negativity was manifesting. Because the negativity was also connected with us, inside us. So it had to be fought, and we had to witness it, really, because we couldn't quite do it. Mother had to do it. But the battle was in one room. It wasn't anywhere else.

John Watkinson

She would often completely spoil us, but there'd be the other extreme where we'd be completely blasted because the negativity would try to act through us. We were around Shri Mataji all the time. Seeing Shri Mataji in a fury, I think that's the strongest I've ever felt the vibrations. She would just get everybody together and one by one, go into that person. But the vibrations were so incredibly powerful. I've never felt vibrations like it when Shri Mataji's been angry. I mean, when she was angry with someone else, just being in the room was so powerful. But she was actually giving her blessings, really, because she's just driving a thing out. Sometimes she'd have you on the run for days, weeks, blasting you. But it was all her compassion, that I don't think we as human beings could ever understand.

Unidentified Speaker 6

Can I tell a story on the subject of building? Once, we were at Brompton Square. It was '83 and virtually finished, looking absolutely beautiful. It had not been wallpapered. So me, Antonio, and another guy had this idea: "Let's wallpaper this wall as a surprise for Mother." Mother said she was going to an international conference and would leave about 3 o'clock. She said she would come back the next day, early morning. That gave us plenty of hours.

We waited for Mother to go. She was looking so beautifully dressed when she went. But Mother knew what we were thinking; we were just waiting for her to go so we could do the surprise. At last, Mother left with Sir C.P. Now we could decorate that wall. We started decorating, and ten minutes later, Mother is back. Sir C.P. would often forget some important documentation. It was quite common.

And Mother caught us in the act. "So, what are you up to?" "Oh, well, we are decorating this wall." "Oh, I see. Well, remember this. When you start something, it's not auspicious to leave it half done. So make sure you finish it. If you must, drink as much coffee as you want, but finish that. And there's one more thing. Sir C.P. does not like a gap in between the wallpapers. See, that looks very unprofessional. You mustn't leave a gap. Not because of me, but because of Sir C.P., make sure it looks professional."

"Of course, of course," we said. Antonio is a professional artist; he would never leave a gap, neither would we. No gaps, guaranteed. We finished the whole job by about 5 a.m. and we double-checked. No gaps whatsoever. We went to sleep.

At about 9 a.m., there's a ring on the bell. We were all exhausted. I went to answer the door. It was Sir C.P. He had gone straight to work. He said, "I wasn't sure whether to ring or not in case you were resting, but I checked the vibrations. And on vibrations, I felt that one of you at least must be awake." "Yes, that was right, I was awake."

So Mother came in. She didn't look very pleased; we could feel there was something wrong. She didn't say anything about the wallpapering and went to bed. She got up at about midday. We went to see her, and she was a bit gloomy. We thought, "My goodness, Mother should be very pleased with this beautiful wallpapering." But she was really sad. We said, "Mother, didn't you like the wallpapering?"

"I did, very much." "So what's the problem, Sir C.P. saw a very big gap on the wall." "That's not possible! We checked it three times. There is no gap whatsoever." Mother said, "Yes, I'm sorry. There is a gap on the wallpaper." "Impossible. Shall I show you?" So Mother stood up and showed us the gap. We looked at it. "Oh my God, what a gap on the wallpaper!" I think it's called shrinkage. It shrank during the night or something.

Really, we could have died that moment. Mother said, "Don't worry about it. Let's fix it with vibrations. Just push it." We didn't have faith for that. So Mother started pushing the wallpaper. We were just looking at her. "Aren't you going to help me, please? Are you just standing there watching me? You push it, too." So we all started pushing the wallpaper from all directions. The paper didn't budge a millimeter.

We said, "Mother, it's too late. It's totally dry now. There's nothing we can do. We'll strip it off and start again." "No, no, no, you don't get the point. It's not you who pushes it. It's the vibrations that actually do it. Just push. Have some faith." We pushed a bit more with Mother. We felt sorry for her, pushing the paper, but nothing budged. So we knew we had to have a big meal, get lots of cups of tea for encouragement, and then strip the paper.

We did that. We had a big meal, big cups of tea, and thought, "Well, let's do it. We have to strip the whole thing off and start again." We arrived there to find the gap. "Okay, where is the gap?" "Oh, it's here." "No, no, no, not there. There." "Where?" We started looking. We couldn't find the gap. The gap was gone while we had lunch and a cup of tea. So the vibrations did it in the end, but not in front of our eyes.

John Watkinson

To cut a long story short, I was literally running late. Shri Mataji was there with Pamela at the station. I just ran into the station, bought the ticket, and ran to the train. I could see Pamela and Shri Mataji in first class. I thought, "God, I should have got a first-class ticket." So I went in and said, "I'm just going to go and change my ticket, Shri Mataji." She said, "Why?" I said, "Well, I just didn't think, Shri Mataji. I bought a second class." She said, "Pamela, go and change our tickets." I said, "No, no, it's okay," and pleaded with Shri Mataji, but she wouldn't have it. She made Pamela go and change their tickets to second class.

Pamela arrived back and I thought, "Oh my God, not only am I late, but Shri Mataji's changing her ticket to second class." So Shri Mataji was in the lead and the three of us walked from carriage to carriage. She went into the second-class carriage and it was completely packed. "Oh no," I thought, and I started feeling really guilty and getting a catch in my heart. We went into the next carriage and again it was completely packed. I think it was the fourth carriage before Pamela sat down on Shri Mataji's luggage or something, and Shri Mataji sat down opposite her. I sort of gingerly sat opposite Shri Mataji, feeling still quite bad about it all.

But then the train pulled away and I felt something in my lap. It was Shri Mataji's foot. She said, "Rub my feet." I thought, "Wow." So I started to rub her feet. It was always different when you rubbed Shri Mataji's feet. Sometimes you felt quite hot or uncomfortable. Other times you'd go into complete joy and bliss, and that was one of those times. I just went into this complete joy. The vibrations would go right into your center heart. You'd have a big whoosh of energy and just feel lots of love. The only way I can explain it is that I just wanted to go into her feet. I just wanted to hug her, kiss her. It was uncontrollable ecstasy, bliss, and joy. And that went on for three hours.

So that guilt and center heart catch just completely disappeared. That particular weekend in Sheffield, Shri Mataji just completely spoiled me, always giving me her food. That was one of the occasions when I called her "Mum" by mistake many times. So it went from feeling guilty and insecure to feeling complete joy and bliss. We were incredibly lucky to have that opportunity to touch her feet, to put our head on her feet, to have that care.

Interviewer

Best second class ticket you ever had. Did she have that sense of humour, making you laugh?

John Watkinson

Yes. I've got another one. She had very fast, quick humour. Myself and Fergie were there with many people working. There was an area of the house which was like an outside courtyard, but much smaller. It was referred to as "the well." Shri Mataji was coming down the stairs and she said to me, "Where's Fergie?" And I said, "I think he's in the well." And she said, "Who put him in?" I said, "Pun." And she said, "Little Tommy Thin." She was so fast that it took a little while to get the joke.

Interviewer

Ladies, give me some experiences that you had individually. Start with Kay.

Kay McHugh

The wallpaper story just triggered a memory for me. We were wallpapering in Shri Mataji's bedroom, and it's a story to show that she's sort of correcting us all the time. There were three of us all wallpapering on one wall, so it was chaotic. We were crisscrossing each other, and I was getting glue on my head as somebody was up the ladder. I was looking at all their pieces of wallpaper and they were kind of skewed with little creases in them. I was putting my piece up, and I finished it and thought, "Look, no creases." It looked absolutely perfect. I was looking down the wall at the others going... And Shri Mataji swept past and said, "Hmm, upside down, isn't it?"

Guillmette Metouri

I was very shy. I was not as brave as all these yogis you see here because since the beginning I was very, very impressed by Mother. I remember at the beginning, I found it much easier to communicate with her without her physical presence. For instance, when they started to say that she was the Holy Spirit, I thought, "Oh my God, I'd like to believe that, but Shri Mataji will have to prove it to me."

I remember at this castle meeting, everybody was there. She was stroking everybody's hands, talking to everyone. She would always ignore me. And I was thinking, "My God," but all the answers I wanted to have, she would give me during the talk. I remember she was talking one day about the Holy Spirit, because "Holy Spirit" was a bit difficult for me to accept in front of my friends, who would laugh at me. On the way to that meeting, I was praying to her, saying, "Okay, Shri Mataji, give me a good answer. Show me who you are, this Holy Spirit." It was just in my head. I got there, and there were about 100 people, and again I was at the back. She gave an explanation during the talk, and then she went, "Hmm," like that, straight at me, right at the back. I was so impressed and thought, "My God, how does she know I wanted to know that?"

It happened in many instances. So one day, I was at Shri Mataji's house for a problem with curtains. I had to go because they couldn't find anyone else. Mother took me down to the dining room and said, "You see, I want to make curtains there. Rosie Lyons is going to make them. We are going to measure..." And she was talking to me, and I went blank. "Did you understand me?" And I said, "Yes, Mother." There I was in front of the window, thinking, "What am I going to do now?"

She came back, passed by, and asked, "Is it going okay?" "Yes, yes, yes, Mother." I had a meter in my hand, trying to figure out I don't know what. Half an hour later, I was still there. She came back. "Okay, have you understood?" I looked at her like this. She said, "Okay, I'm going to explain to you. Look, this measures this, that, that. This is such and such meters." She gave me the measurements, and I put it right in my head. I thought, "Okay, all I have to do is listen to Mother's measurements. It can't go wrong."

So she gave me the measurements. "Now you can tell Rosie when you go home." "Thank you, Mother. Yes." I was repeating these measurements. I went to Rosie, who was very down-to-earth and practical. I said, "Rosie, Mother gave me these measurements for the curtains." She said, "Okay, what are they?" I gave her the numbers. "Are you crazy?" she said. "That means we need kilometers of material. That can't be." I said, "Yes, Rosie, Mother told me. I'm pretty sure she told me." "No, no, no, it's far too much." "Mother said, Rosie, I don't know."

Then she phoned Shri Mataji. And Shri Mataji said, "What? What did he not say to you? Of course not."

Another time, she called us. We were married and had Fatima. One day we got a phone call, I think it was Warren from Mother's house, saying, "Could you come? Mother needs some people." Again, I tried to phone other people, but I couldn't find anyone. I had to go. On the way, I met Dania, Magda's daughter. "Do you know why we are going?" "No. Mother wants to see us."

We arrived and Shri Mataji was in her big bedroom. She said, "Hello. Yes, I've called you to give you a lesson of Indian philosophy." "Okay." "Don't worry," she said. "It will be very easy. You will have nothing to do. Just watch." She had invited a group of ladies whose husbands were working with Sir C.P. They were from the diplomatic services, from different countries. All these ladies arrived, very superficial, talking blah, blah, blah.

Mother showed them the house. I remember there was a lady who spotted a tea cozy with pearls. It was white with pearls. The lady said, "Oh, how nice it is." "Okay, you like it? Have it," Mother said. They didn't know that she was giving things away like this.

Then it was lunchtime. She had invited them for lunch. I was just standing behind the table serving, passing some dishes. The conversation was so strange. I was used to seeing Mother giving spiritual lectures, and here it was just about trivial things. But the kind of love she was giving to these ladies, talking about being fat and wanting to be slim. They were all saying, "Oh, yes, I need to slim," and she was there, smiling, pouring love on them. In the end, she said, "Yes, it's nice. But you see, after a certain age, it's also nice to have a bit of kilos on." They were talking about the traffic in London and about very, very superficial things.

I noticed that day that the kind of attention and love she was giving to these ladies was exactly the same she would give to us, though they were not interested in her spirituality. It was quite amazing. In the end, they left, and she gave us a little present. I got a little Mangala Sutra, Dania got a little brooch. And she thanked us in such a warm way. "Thank you very much. You helped me so much." We were just there, completely flabbergasted.

Carol, you've been quiet for a while. What have you got?

Carol Garrido

I'm lurking, remembering. Mother had given Chantal, Ray Harris' wife, some very beautiful jewellery because they were getting married. It was a pink jade in a silver setting. And like you've all been saying, Mother feels what's in your heart, and I sort of felt, "Hmm, I've just got married too, and Mother didn't give me anything." It's terrible when you feel those things.

Before long, I honestly can't remember whether we went to Brompton Square with Louis, but Mother said, "Oh," and she apologised profusely to me that she hadn't given me anything already. She went into her bedroom and found something, and she brought me a little pink jade necklace in a silver setting, very, very sweet and beautiful. I suddenly felt, gosh, and pulled my ears, feeling how Mother just knows what's in your heart, whatever it is. And she even apologised to me so much that it was only something very little, that it wasn't so grand or so big as what she'd given to Chantal.

Luis Garrido

There was an interesting miracle at the airport. Have you ever seen a man who is seven foot tall? His hips are about this wide, and the back is even bigger. The size of his boots... in a kind of security man's uniform. One of those guys was there one day, about seven foot tall at least. What a big man. And he started shouting at people, "Move out of the way!" Nobody reacted. So he lost patience and started pulling people out of the way, especially women with pushchairs. The women were jumping in the air with the pushchairs, one to the left, one to the right.

He started making his way towards Mother, because Mother was the source of the blockage. She was sitting there receiving flowers. He started shouting at Mother, "Please get out of the way!" I thought I must tell this man, "Look, this lady is a very spiritual lady. You must respect her." So I touched his arm. "Excuse me, sir, that lady..."

"Did you touch the uniform?" he asked me. "Yes, sir, I touched the uniform, I just wanted to tell you..." "Excuse me, did you touch the uniform?" "Yes, I touched the uniform, that lady..." "Did you touch the uniform?" I said, "Yes, I'm sorry, I touched the uniform." Then he lifted his boot. "You touch the uniform again, and your head will be under my foot."

I was amazed. Then two ladies pushed me from the back and dragged me away. They said, "Louis, shut up, leave him alone." The man carried on all the way towards Mother, pushing people left and right. He arrived face to face with Mother. He looked at Mother, Mother gave him one glance, and the man did like this, went round Mother and disappeared in front of her. All Mother did was look at him. A man that size, and we were all afraid of him.

That reminds me of the fire. You had a can of... burning off the paint in Brompton Square. I was there and I watched it, and the fire went just like that man, right to Mother and right around her like that.

Linda Williams

Well, I got blamed for this, in a rather unfortunate way. I mean, what actually happened was... my job at Brompton Square was always stripping the paint off. I was pretty good at paint stripping, having done it for eight months, and I knew that the one thing you never did was leave an oxy-acetylene torch on. You never, never left it on because it's extremely dangerous. As a lecturer, when Mother says, "Linda left the torch on," what she says becomes the truth. But in fact, what happened was, at least as far as I remember...

I remember walking in that room. The whole floor was covered in chalk dust, because I think John Ewan was making those cornices in that room. And I saw that some idiot had left this oxy-acetylene torch on, pointing into the middle of the room. It's something I literally would never have done in a million years, plus I wasn't even stripping in that room anyway. Mother was there. That day, she was wearing a synthetic sari, which made it even more of a miracle.

Mother walked in the room and appeared not to see the torch. The blue flame jumped out of the torch, and it went towards her. The blue flame went right around her sari in a ring of fire, and then went back to the torch. By this time, I was lying on the floor, because I just thought, "My God, she's going to go up in smoke," because it was a nylon sari. I just jumped and landed on my tummy. I just grabbed the torch to turn it the other way, and I think that's probably why Mother thought it was me who had the torch, because I just dived onto the floor.

And I remember her saying, "The fire cannot burn me. I am the fire." Alison Ravina, I remember talking to her about this story, she said she remembers Mother saying, "The fire is just doing arti to me." It was just extraordinary, because that was a nylon sari, and the blue flame went right around it. It was the most extraordinary thing. But as I said, I go down in history as being the one who left the torch laying around.

One of my first times going to the airport to see Mother, we were holding bits of her luggage, and Mother suddenly turned to me and said, "What were you doing going to my house and doing namaskar on the pavement?" Mother had just recently given a talk about not saying, "But, Mother." So I thought to myself, "Don't say 'but, Mother'." And also, I was thinking inside, "But Mother, you are God, you are divine, you know everything. You know I didn't do this." I just said to Mother, "I don't know, Mother," because I couldn't think of anything else to say. I just stood there, and Mother just turned away and talked to somebody else.

Years later, I went to see Mother and she said, "Yes, your wife is very sensible, such a decent, good lady. You should listen to her a lot more. Except, I can't understand why she did that, going to do namaskar there on the floor at that house where I used to live many years ago. That is so unlike her." "But Mother, it wasn't her, it was someone else." "What? And you didn't tell me? All these years, you know, I've been very confused because this doesn't go with her personality. You should have told me." "Well, we thought, Mother, that because of who you are, you know everything." "Well, you have to tell me," Mother said. "These things you have to tell me. It is confusing for the brain." Mother has a memory, and our character and personality... her memory is incredible.

I asked Mother once, rather stupidly, "Mother, do you know everything?" We were shopping or something, in a very materialistic environment, and she said very casually, "Yes. Well, I can know every thought, word, and deed of every human being from the beginning of time to the end of creation, simultaneously, if I want. But I can't be bothered."

Interviewer

On that note, I think we'll say thank you very much, everyone, for taking your time. It's been a fantastic experience. Thank you.

She asked me one day to go in and choose a sari. She was going to an interview down at Brighton. She said, "Go in and choose one of my saris. Which one should I wear?" And I said, "Oh, dear, this is universal. This is going to have repercussions if I don't get the right sari." There were two rows of saris going around three walls. You think, which one do you choose? Because one's always better than the other. I thought, "I've always loved that one with the little orange dots on it." I came out, and she must have thought I was taking so long, because she'd already gone into the bathroom. I sat outside to wait for her to come out because I hadn't told her which sari I'd chosen. But of course, she came out with that sari on. Out of what must have been 700 saris in there, that was the one she was wearing. She said, "Just be careful. I do know what you think."

Linda Williams

When we think thoughts, she was picking up people's thoughts. She was talking about the hundredth monkey effect, and she said, "Basically how it works is, if we as Sahaja Yogis think good thoughts, that can go into the collective consciousness of the whole of humanity." It's in the Pratishthan chapter at the end of the India book of recollections. It's really important that we have very positive thoughts about everything. If we watch the news and we have positive thoughts, then it's likely that that will happen. Because what we think is actually seminal; it goes everywhere. And she said that's how the hundredth monkey effect works on the level of humanity. That's one of our roles as Sahaja Yogis.

General Discussion

You can see how it's been proven by the fact that quite a lot of Sahaja terminology is starting to move its way out into the mainstream. I see "vibrations" in many more places than ever before. Do you notice that? I've seen someone say, "That's got really cool vibrations," talking about something with nothing to do with Sahaja Yoga. This is definitely the collective consciousness working out. I've seen that in a lot more cases. I mean, even yoga itself. Look where yoga is now as a concept, compared to where it was. It's quite acceptable. It's just an unbelievable change in a very short space of time. So the enlightened attention is clearly doing something.

I saw a big billboard one time, and there was a woman with her hand above someone's head, going like this. It's all over the place. I saw a video the other day where they were working on something, and you could see it being sort of purloined by various people, skirting the truth and using our whole environment, our words, and our actions. I think it's amazing to see that sort of stuff.

I've got a personal goal to get "left-sided" and "right-sided" into the collective consciousness. I want to be the first person to do it. "You're very left-sided today." I think that'll be the win.

No, actually, what they say now is they talk about people's ego with actors and stuff like that. "He's got a big ego." That's something that used to not happen.
