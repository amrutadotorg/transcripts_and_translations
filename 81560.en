 (England)
Yeah, we used to come sometimes when we were catching the train. We used to sometimes go back and forth. We'd have cucumber sandwiches, tea. Cucumber sandwiches... I don't remember being with Shri Mataji; I remember being with her in McDonald's, just on the other side. I had some sort of moment where I was saying, "Wow, God is drinking Coca-Cola." I had the same thing, the same sort of vision as you, that Mother was moving into Ashley Gardens and she sent the lad out for a McDonald's. Yeah, that's true. We all had that, the McDonald's.

And Mother was so unconventional. You know how she thinks about alcohol, right? I remember there was this worker, he's an English worker, who worked with her, and she gave him a bottle of black Chivas Regal, which is a rather good brand of whiskey. She gave it to him because that's what was going to make him happy at that point.

When she left Herst Green, there were a load of guys doing removal stuff for her. And when they left with the stuff they were taking away, on the table, there were bottles of either Chivas Regal or some other Scotch whiskey for them to have one each. She gave them one each, and when the boss found out, he was horrified. He could already hear singing coming from the back of the van. Because that was supposed to be gifts for diplomats, no?

And when she gave the cigars to the lady... she was inviting all the ladies from the surrounding houses. We were coming to be the English people. And one of them asked if she could smoke, so Mother offered her a really good Habana cigar. You could see this woman was torn between wanting to look cool and accept it, but knowing that there's no way she could smoke a cigar. Mother just called her bluff completely, and she sort of said, "No, thank you, that's fine."

He was present at one of their diplomatic get-togethers at the house. He said neither Sir C.P. nor Mother seemed to have any concept of what alcohol did to people because they just kept filling up people's glasses as fast as they could drink them. They seemed to have no idea, especially Sir C.P. But, well, alcohol is actually a weapon in diplomacy. I saw it in China because in China they have a very strong alcohol. And they make you drink, because at some point you can't handle it, and then you are more vulnerable.

I remember, that's one time where I was full of sympathy for Pat, because I think that was one of the tests in your life. At some point, Shri Mataji told you to pour the bottles of... I still remember that because I thought, gee, this is going to be tough for him. He was brave, but he was brave from the moment when Mother told the people in Gavin's home, "You should drop drugs." And the feeling in the group was, "No way." And then Pat said, "Okay, I'll do it." And I remember that. I remember that, yeah.

I think until we went to India, to Kathmandu? Well, we met in Mumbai first, and then we went off. That was the only time, because you stayed with Mother, and we didn't see you. That was the first time. This is when I had this ridiculous white suit, or not? I don't remember that. I just remember you sort of on your knees in front of Mother saying, "Forgive them, they know not what they do," or something. I know, it was very dramatic, but you were the only one taking her side.

Yeah, but I remember when he said, "I will stop," it was like, paf, something... the table stirred. Because the group was really not taking the message.

I was telling friends about this white suit because Shri Mataji told me, "We're going to see the yogis." When I came from the US, I had an American army jacket and jeans, and that's the way I knocked at the door, and the American army jacket was torn. So I said, "Oh my God, we're going to meet the yogis." So I went and I bought a sort of Elvis Presley white suit, and on top of it—I must have been out of my mind—a red bow tie. And I arrived. We climbed the staircase... and looked at the room. So I took my bow tie out; I couldn't take the suit off. But they made fun of me for this for quite some time. "But the yogis, we're going to meet the yogis, my God." Oh, the yogis. They were a very wild bunch. The whole room was full of the local crowd. I saw them all, and I thought, "Oh my God, what's going to happen here?" Because they were quite a bunch.

It was only about my second or third time. Was that during the trip you came over from America in the first place? To meet Mother? Or did you meet her earlier than that? Was that a second trip to see her? It must be the second one. I think it's around the 20th of August 1975. When we first came. Oh, so it must have been the second. Oh, you came after me? Yes. Oh, I didn't know that. Okay, I thought you came before. So that meeting is after that.

Yeah, because I got lost, you remember? I put it in the book. I stopped then. I was trying to help this wretched Ignatius to come to Mother's house, and he didn't turn up, and I failed to make it. I got lost. So I went off the wagon spectacularly that weekend. I remember going round there and you were singing, "What a difference a day makes." Yeah, it was a bit feeble, but I was obviously in such a state. I know. But the thing was, it meant so much to you to miss it.

What is sweet is we pretty soon had a feeling of brothers and sisters. I remember my feeling towards Marie Rouget. At some point, in the corridor, Sir C.P. had just arrived, and I was always anxious that we behave correctly. I remember Marie was sort of crying on the shoulder of Shri Mataji in front of Sir C.P. And I was feeling so embarrassed, but I was feeling embarrassed as if it was my own sister who doesn't know. My embarrassment was my own sister doesn't know it's not time to do this in front of the husband of Shri Mataji. So we gelled together pretty fast, I feel. We were such an odd mixture. It was the hope of the world, you know. Strange people.

In Herst Green, I remember Shri Mataji putting all her shoes on the table. Who remembers that? She put, I don't know, X pairs of shoes on the table, and we were around with our hands because we asked her to put our hands towards her shoes. Do you remember? And we were looking so stoned. I was looking at the scene, and I said, "Right, now we have to change the world with this bunch," looking around the pairs of shoes and taking... we didn't know actually what it was to take vibrations from.

Pat was saying that she had tried speaking to a politician. Well, lots of them. She tried in her own circles and got nowhere. It was William Whitelaw, wasn't it? She was speaking to him at a dinner party and was talking to him about how we must change society. He literally turned around and said, "Well, why? What's wrong with it?" Well, now we would have the answer. But even so, you see, if you're rich and okay, in his view, his life was fine. It was the other people's problem. So that's when Mother said she had to start looking at other people because she tried with the people that didn't have the huge deficit that we had.

This is really the experience I had because at some point we were in Dehradun. And we gave realization to a gentleman who was, at that time we called him Joshi, and he was the chief of staff of the Indian Army. Look at the top, solid. We were in his thing, and at some point, he didn't really feel the vibration. And then I asked him to ask Shri Mataji, "Who is Durga?" because Durga is the goddess of the warriors, right? And he asked the picture. And then I saw tears coming out of his eyes. And then I said, "Gee, what is the difference?" This is the general-in-chief of the army.

But it's not only England; it's the West. All the guys who are somewhere up the ladder in our country just have too much ego. So we were very happy to have a few doctors. When they showed up, you were still a student. One had given up being a doctor. He was working in a factory. He'd lost confidence in being a doctor. He'd spent too long in Goa on the beach, stoned out of his mind. But to him, he could see it was a complete waste of time. He wrote his book for all the stoneheads of the world.

Did you notice I spelled the first word in the book wrong? "Foreword." Yeah, it was spelled "forward" as in "forward home." It should be "foreword," the word before. But I spelled it "forward" as in "going home." And the proofreader missed it. Everyone missed it. So there's no way I could promote it with that because it would just be ridiculed by anyone who wasn't a rogue.

But, when I read... because your parents were administrators in Hong Kong, and this was a generation of doers. They were a solid generation. They were the wing captain in the Royal Air Force or whatever. I read a book when I was in the U.S. that inspired Newt Gingrich and Al Gore. And it's "Generations: The History of America's Future." What they say, and I think it applies to you, is that because the generation of our parents were such solid people—that generation who defeated Hitler, who built the Bretton Woods Institution, engineers, no-nonsense, solid people—because of them, we had the guts to seek. Today, people who throw stones in Brixton or wherever, they don't seek because their parents didn't give them any start.

We took our mom to Quebec two weeks ago. Your mom? She's 92. And she's so quiet and unassuming. She's been a Catholic all her life, but she said, "It's amazing. It's so peaceful." So she's got her blessings. Your dad is still alive? No, he passed away. He had a hard time because he was drinking. But he recognized Mother. He did. The last six weeks, he couldn't drink because he was in hospital, and he cleared out incredibly. When he died, I arrived just an hour afterwards. And it was like this kind of opening above his body into this dimension of complete peace. And I thought, "How the hell did you do that?" It's just incredible. He was in trouble his whole life and he still managed to be taken somewhere half-decent.

Well, he was blessed, Mother said. She shook his hand. He brought Kevin to Mother's house when he was 17, and she managed to open the door herself, and that never happened. He took her hand, he held her hand automatically, and she wouldn't let go. They had a tug-of-war on the doorstep. She pulled him in. He basically pulled through the door, and she made him sit next to her. She held his hand and talked to him. And some days later, he said, "Is it strange to not be able to get somebody out of your mind?" And I said, "Well, it depends who it is." He said, "It's Shri Mataji." And he got his realization; he felt it. He was sitting in front of the fire saying, "Fire is hot and cold." That must have given you great joy, isn't it? Well, it was temporary because he fell back, partly because my mum's Catholic. She freaked out. But she's changed a lot.

Dealing with Catholicism is something... I think the first big confrontation, if I may say, between our maker and the church was at the marriage of my brother. Because Arnaud married Maria, who is Portuguese, Catholic, traditional. So there was a Catholic marriage. And the entire family were sort of, "Who is this lady?" And we were sort of hugging... It was very... and the priest was like this. And I read the book of the apocalypse in the church. And it was quite dramatic.

The last question. You said you didn't meet at the same time. So had you met her somewhere other than England?

No, I met her in England. Quite a story, I must say. I heard about her in Berkeley from a student called Rajesh Shah. There was an Indian boy from Bombay in the Johns Hopkins University where I studied. So when I went to Berkeley, I went into the flat of Rajesh and there were a couple of people who were stoned there. And Rajesh was sort of watching it. I remember one exited the flat crawling on his own.

Anyway, he started speaking to me about Shri Mataji. And he wanted to give me my realization. I said, "No way. Who do you think you are?" I was not going to get my realization from this guy. And then he told me about Shri Mataji. He told me she was Sita. She was Radha. She was the Virgin Mary. That blew me off. The guy was not stupid, so I said, "Well, then I need to change."

Then I flew to London. I had a friend in London who was a lifeguard of the Queen. Two years earlier, I had visited him in Cambridge, and he picked me up at the airport. He's a really sweet boy. And I remember I was in the car, and he tells me, "Grégoire, I have an affair. I hope you don't mind." I said, "Of course I don't mind. Why should I mind?" He has a girlfriend. And then I was in the back of the car, and he said, "Well, I'm sure you'll like Richard." And I was like, "Oh, shit." I wasn't really prepared for that. We were moving into another cultural sort of development.

So, when I came back to see Shri Mataji, I stopped at his flat. And this boy who was cute and was really sweet and everything, he looked like the portrait of Dorian Gray. You could see he was sort of... So it's from that flat that I called Shri Mataji. And I said, "My friend Rajesh Shah..." And I still remember her voice. Her voice was like coming from the clouds. I was in that flat, and there were a couple of guys around. It was really weird. And then I had that voice who came from somewhere else. She said, "Yeah, sure, come and meet me. I'm waiting for you."

And then I went. I remember I went to this house where we are going, and I rang the bell. On the right side, all dressed in white. And I was all scrappy, of course. No long hair. I tried to look like I had some education, so I actually kissed her hand. And she said, "May God bless you." And that's the way it started. And then at some point she told me, "I will have to test you." And then I burst into laughter. "Oh, you can test me." Because I didn't know what it meant. In those days, we thought we could not do anything wrong.

I just remembered that I kissed her hand as well the first time I met her. That's why, I suppose, then it was after that, as she walked out, she turned around and blew me that kiss. And his son, she said, "He's like a Roman soldier," remember? When Kevin said, "Why don't you put the red carpet out for her?" she said, "Look at him. He's like a Roman soldier." He was quite remarkable when he was young. One day, in my friend's car, he was sitting in the back, and he said, "I think God gave me an extra eye." Well, that's because he's your son. Anyway. He's come back into the fold a lot.

This is now what I think is really the priority. I didn't turn up to Cabella this year because I didn't want to have to chat with everybody and explain what's going to happen and what is to be arranged, and committees and all this nonsense. Because we need to try to imbibe what it means that she goes from the Sakar to the Nirakar. Otherwise, if this doesn't happen, then what? Then we are going to spread the numbers, like the Catholics and the Sunnis. And then we are going to have schools and pilgrimage places, health centers. And people will think that's it. That's not it at all.

Anything you read that Mother said, all that is just to keep us busy. We have to come to a different level. It needs to be automatic. If you look at some of the young people, everything they do is so much. They're not going to read a book or go to school. They live so much.

There is something that Mother told me. It's a bit tough. That was in a house in Ashley Gardens. She said, "Those who build the stage are not those who climb on it." And I was there, and I was thinking, "Hey, wait a minute. Where am I in there?" She also said to us that you put the rubble in the foundation. It's a similar... Not the rubbish, though. She got angry with you, I remember, in Kathmandu, when you said something to the effect of, "Mother, does that mean we'll just be forgotten about, buried in mud underneath everyone else?" And she said, "No, no, that is the most important." Because you need to be solid to be a founding stone. It means we are not those who are going to manifest ourselves.

Look at the artists of our generation. In our generation, there were some yogis who were musicians, right? None of them, bless their soul, managed to be the Mozarts and the Vivaldis of the new age. While now, when you look at the yogis, there is so much talent. It's really bubbling.

I really enjoyed the music festival we had at the farm in England recently. I thought the talent was amazing, some of the younger ones. Incredible. I was quite surprised. When it first started, I remember walking into the big public program we had at the Hammersmith Town Hall. And there was this so-called Sahaj group on the stage. And they were singing this song, and it went something like, "Seek and you shall find." And I kind of felt like, "God, this is just horrendous." But it's changed so much. There's some real talent there. I really enjoyed it. I was incredibly impressed.

Another similarity I had with him is being embarrassed. When we were facing the public in Caxton Hall, we were always anticipating what they may think of us. And we needed to go over that. I can remember the feeling. Absolutely. I just felt inadequate. Not a good example in any way. I was half-dead. But I think she used that, we didn't understand, for energetic purposes. Shopping with her in Oxford Street was an agony. I was in the shop looking for the next chair all the time because I was so tired. Shopping with her was not an agony, of course—we enjoyed being with Shri Mataji beyond words—but it was exhausting. Because being with her and being in Oxford Street, so much stuff was going through us.

Most of it was hard work, I found, for me, anyway. Of course you enjoy being with her, but it was very hard work. It was such a blessing, but it was really like marine training. It was like the night of taking vibrations. Half my mind would be, "This is amazing." The other half, "Just wake up and tell me I can go to sleep now." And then when Mother did, I thought, "Oh, no, I don't want to." That struggle to physically keep yourself going. Or even just rubbing Mother's feet, taking the vibrations. It would go on and on and on sometimes. And your arms are just on fire. You just want... you can't keep going. And yet, it's such an amazing thing, and she wants you to keep going, so you have to. It was all quite tough in many ways.

I always remember when Mother first moved from Herst Green, she moved to that place by Sloane Square, didn't she? That flat. And while we were there, she had a load of furniture, and she made us all move it. And there was tons and tons of it. At a certain stage, as we were all really, really knackered, she said, "Oh, you're all rather tired, but the vibrations are flowing really well." And I remember thinking then, "Uh-oh."

So, when you met Mother originally, what was it that convinced you that she was who she was?

Okay, this is the reason why I had the guts to write The Advent. At some point, Shri Mataji showed us to read the chapters of the book which is now going to be published for yogis, which we call the Opus Magnum of Shri Mataji. The beginning is the story of the creation. I found this, of course, mind-blowing, but I told Shri Mataji, "Mother, this is fantastic. It's going to fly above the heads of the people. I think someone should write a little introduction." And she asked me, "Would you like to do it?" And I said, "Well, me, Mother? You want me to do it?" So I said, "Okay, I'll write the introduction," and that became The Advent.

The reason why I had the guts to write The Advent is because of what I'm now telling you. I don't think I remember 20% of what happened to me. But anyway, sometimes I remember saying, "Gee, this is so important. I should remember. I should write it down." And we never did. I think it's not meant to stay.

Anyway, I think the second time when I visited, I had come back from Switzerland. And I was in the little salon. You remember the salon up there? At some point, she asked me, because I felt that... you thought you were finished because of the drugs, but I thought I was finished because of the Mooladhara Chakra. So, finished for finished. At some point, I was laying on my tummy, just flat, before a statue of Shri Ganesha. And she asked me, "Ask forgiveness to Shri Ganesha." So I was laying like this before the statue, and I was asking, "Please, Shri Ganesha, forgive me." And then I felt cool vibrations coming from the statue. And I tell you, this was something.

So, in that same room, I was going to leave. And I felt, "I'm not going to maintain this." Because as he described in his book, when you are with her, you feel so comfortable, the comfort of the spirit. You feel so within the territory of love. But then when you leave, it's another matter. So I felt, "I'm not going to manage that." I had to take my plane.

And then she was sitting almost like you and me. And she said—she was like this—and then she said, "You shouldn't be sad." Because I was feeling sad, but I was not telling her. And she just said to me, "You shouldn't feel sad." And she did something like that with her hands. And then... the complete, total... When we feel vibrations, it's in a gaseous state, according to the sixth chapter of the Dnyaneshwari, "Kundalini Adyaya." But when that raises to a certain power, it's like a cloud becomes condensed into water, right? So it was a liquid. It was not gaseous; it was a liquid coming into each and every cell of the body. And it was a complete amrut.

You know, human beings imagine that the highest intensity of sensation they can experience is sex. But that was more than that. And in the entire body. And it was sacred. Because it was spiritual, it was sacred, but it was also physical. So it was both sacred and physical. I felt this thing, and that's when I knew... a saint cannot do that. A prophet cannot do that. So that's when I said, "Gee, this is something else." And it went away after some time. I never had such a powerful experience afterwards. Never, ever. And yet, afterwards, I hope I was better than what I was then. This was compassion. She gave us those experiences because she probably thought that we needed to comfort our own confidence. Otherwise, we would just be washed away. So, it's just out of compassion she gave us these things.

That was the same room where I had my experience where she actually became the Virgin Mary.

On that one, I was in my garden in Kathmandu. I have a picture. She came three times to Kathmandu. I don't know whether it was when you were there or not. But at some point, she was sitting in the corner of the garden on a little chair. And I asked how the Virgin Mary wore her... because she's always represented with something on her head. And then she took her sari and she put it... and that was very moving.

And about this house where you were. You know that Liz Lotter, who was this lady who had an old Vienna restaurant in Kathmandu, and a lot of Germans and Austrians came to Sahaja Yoga thanks to her. One day, she moved into a house, and the landlady living next door came into her house. And she sees the picture of Shri Mataji and says, "A couple of years ago, there was a young man working for the United Nations, and this lady came and visited him." Liz Lotter, without knowing it, in the entire city of Kathmandu, had rented the house where I had received Shri Mataji, just in Nakpokari, behind the old palace. So that's the little... you know, they say the devil is in the details, but for us, God is in the details.

One or two months ago, I was in Portugal. And I walked into the hall of the Tivoli Hotel where Shri Mataji went after the marriage of Arnaud. And I just saw the hall and I started crying just in the middle of it. We need to leave ourselves time to absorb this thing.

It was the same hotel, the same hall in which we sat with Shri Mataji in August '80, when Arnaud and Maria got married. Because with the marriage ceremony, as they had invited Shri Mataji, they organized the first programs in Portugal. So it's the same hall, and it's just a flashback.

Is that Lisbon? Yes. I used to live in Lisbon.

Oh, you used to live in Lisbon. If I may, there was something also very moving which happened in Portugal, and that was in Sintra, because the marriage was in Sintra. You know Sintra? Hotel de Seteais. We were in a little restaurant and there was some round bread. Antoinette, my sister was there, and she was blown away because Shri Mataji explained the communion. She said Christ was just Pranava. So what he did, he took the bread and he put the vibrations in the bread to vibrate the apostles. And then she took the bread, and she gave it to everybody.

We used to go to Herst Green, which is where Shri Mataji lived at the time. When Sir C.P. moved to London, he found that location. She stayed quite a few years there. And that is the period where you can see Sahaja Yoga started in the West. When she was in Herst Green, it is when it started. That was really the moment. That's why we go down, just as a pilgrimage and paying our homage by taking the train again, even if the color of the train has changed.

On the back of a seat, we had put a batik representing Shri Kalki, that is, Vishnu on a white horse. And on that evening, she said, "Today is the beginning of the Satya Yuga." That happened in Caxton Hall. And she said, "Today is the beginning of the Satya Yuga." But then I'm saying, okay, it's like if you turn a big, big ship. It takes a long time to change. That which starts in England goes around the world. It has. It's taken a bit longer than I expected.

Well, the thing is, you can only take one step at a time. But there are moments which happen in England that impact the world, and they're actually quite sweet. I remember when I was in the Rome Embassy, I remember the marriage of Charles and Diana. At that time, Diana was realized. And you remember how we felt, no? I was in Rome watching that, and the entire world was watching that.

Now, when Diana had her accident, despite everything about her life, there was such an empathy in the entire world that you had a true moment of collective consciousness. It was amazing. And much closer to us was the wedding of William and Kate. When they went out with the cavalcade and the lifeguards in the back, the sun came out. And you could really feel the blessings. When they sang "Jerusalem" in Westminster... we were watching this at home on the television, and my wife, Cat, said, "I wish they would sing Jerusalem." And three seconds later, the first notes... It was... so, there is still the attention, the blessings. And Mother did say that William is born realized.

It does move people. I mean, when Diana died, it was unbelievable. They lined not just the streets, but the roads. And it rained all day. But even when it immediately happened, people just went to London, and they were just walking about in the parks, opening up to each other. These psychologists tried to dismiss it as some sort of... They were just standing in the park with their hands open, like this. But you see, that, I think, is when you feel the power of the heart. The power which is stored at the subtle level, in the Tattwa of this country. So, it shoots through in these moments.

Oh, definitely. With the recent wedding, two of my sisters and my cousin, who are all aged about 60, went and slept on the pavement the night before to get a good place to watch and to wave them on.

That's a bit much of collectivity. I'm collective enough behind the TV screen.

But many people did that. Many, many people did that. They thought it was an amazing experience. I think because they wanted the collective experience, which was very strong. You see, it's an identity thing. The royal whatever captures some of the identity of the people. And they would like this identity to be something that they can enjoy, and it has not always been the case with the Windsors. So, when they see auspiciousness, because this marriage was auspicious, they want to be part of it. It's brilliant.

So, you see, you hear a lot of cassettes where Shri Mataji gives a scolding to the English. But in that sense, we say in Latin, qui bene amat bene castigat. Who loves well, chastises well. For instance, I counted in my miserable life at least five major scoldings from Shri Mataji, and I have missed the small ones. And actually, when I look at some people who were never corrected by Shri Mataji... including once Guido, she told me once, "Go and tell Guido." She wanted me to tell Guido off. "Go and tell Guido because I cannot tell him myself." So, in a sense, it means that she cared about England, that she loved the English, and that's why she was so much on them.

Well, it's a bit like the older children have to take responsibility.

But also, they didn't mind taking it. They didn't mind actually hearing it.

They didn't mind because they probably didn't notice.

No, no, no. Pat and Maureen, okay, they had the core training. They had to notice. But boy, did we get it. I noticed at Cabella, we worked there for months, seven days a week, and got blasted from one day to the next. And then one person does a little dance in front of Shri Mataji, gets praised. And there were times when you...

But that's what they could take. Tough love. One day, we were coming back from Ratnagiri on the boat, and then Shri Mataji was whisked away in a car with Rajesh. I was, of course, very jealous. And then I ended up in another car with Paul Winter and Bala. And these are two remarkable characters, no? And Paul and Bala started fighting. Paul had rented the car, and he wanted to offload Bala in the middle of nowhere. We were on the road to Pune. And I was saying, "No, Paul, you cannot do this." I was trying to make peace between two strong personalities. We arrived, the three of us, before Shri Mataji. We were completely caught up. And Shri Mataji started scolding me. I walk away. Then Rajesh asked Shri Mataji, "Mother, why did you scold Grégoire? Because it was the other two who were fighting." And Shri Mataji told him, "Because Grégoire was the only one who could take it."

A dubious privilege. But the next morning, she gave me a little statue of Shri Kartikeya, which, I don't know what it means, but I still have it on my altar. It happened many times to many people, I think. But there's a difference between the training and the knowledge. Everybody can have the knowledge, and if you listen to it, you get inspired, stimulated, you get insight. But the training is different. And some people got the training. That's why it's important to communicate. And that's also what you try to do with your book. I was very happy that you could write your book. And I was admiring how you did it, because you did it well. It was really well written, with a little bit of humor, which needs to be there.

Well, when I finished it, I really thought, how the hell did I do that? It wasn't easy. It was just like pushing on and on and on. But yeah, I'm pleasantly surprised at the way it turned out. I hope it does some good.

What I find difficult is to write—and this is where I think you managed—it's very difficult to write about this stage of consciousness. How would you describe your best stage of consciousness?

Elevated, that's all I can say. Elevated. It's hard to describe, huh?

Well, it is. But maybe it's easy to describe as hierarchy, but it's very difficult to describe to anybody else, because people don't understand vibrations.

I think with a lot of the things that we've been through, Greg, it's just instinctive. You know what's right and wrong with a lot of things.

See, this is why vibrations are also in the intuition, the common sense, in the being. And that's why I find it a little bit surprising that some people are now inventing new methodologies that never existed with Shri Mataji—little envelopes and this and that. And when you look at the results, they came up with some wrong results. Because vibrations are not a GPS. You cannot put it in a little box. Vibration is also your consciousness.

That's very true. Well, it's a bit like the pujas. Mother started with a certain thing and changed it and changed it. Some people got stuck at certain points. And, for instance, in England, for ten years, we had a style that was rigid, wasn't it? It was like church. At the time, Mother was... you blink and you miss the puja. She got it to that level. Whereas we were still following, "If I haven't put this here, then that has to be there." He'd stop it in the middle and make us start again. Unbelievable.

But you see, this is ritualism. And ritualism in a religion is an expression of diffidence. If you have trust in your heart and you have confidence in your relationship with God, then you use protocol as an expression of respect that comes from the heart. But if you are afraid—which we all are, all right—but if that fear of losing your connection with the divine is too big, then we try to secure the access through rituals. And this is the entire history of religion. Buddhism was killed by ritualism. All this is coming back in Sahaj.

And that's why the training is important. Because the knowledge itself is not enough. If you would like to help a yogi and say, "Mother said this," that yogi will unearth something else and send you the counter-quote. So you need to understand from inside. And that's what the training was.

So how would you give that training to someone now who's new to Sahaja Yoga? How do you give them the training to know to follow what's inside as opposed to finding it in a book?

Well, if you train someone, you need to be prepared for tough love. Because the yogis, they have a comfort level in love. And from there, they slide easily into a place where everybody is nice, it's all love, it's fine. And with that, you don't deliver the ascent because there is negativity. And we need to be able to stand by what is right. That's the Vishnu aspect.

So, in Austria, I was explaining that. If you want to train someone, first of all, this hand is full of love. So you hold him with love here. Then you can do that because you hold him. Because if he knows I love him, if at some point I tell him something which is a bit tough, he will take it because he knows I love him. It's basically the only way you have this balance between caring about people, but also being clear.

The problem is also that the yogis themselves, the newer ones, have to have the right balance between self-reliance and humility to listen. That's the problem in a lot of them. They're going off into ego. It's just extraordinary. They're arguing about whether the candle should be on the left of the altar or the right. I mean, it's mind-boggling.

You are right, because a piece of advice is only as good as the one who receives it.

Yeah, it's true. But it's interesting to see how it works out. But I do feel a bit frustrated by the way some people who you think you'd be able to rely on are going off on some sidetrack and making it more difficult to deal with the more serious problems.

I was going to talk about a few people we know, but there are two stories I wanted to tell as we are on the train. The first story, you all know it, but it's quite topical. Shri Mataji was telling how she was on a train like this and she saw young kids who were slashing the seats. People were afraid, but she confronted them. Of course, she wasn't afraid. She said, "Why are you doing that?" And they said, "We are very angry." And she said all she could feel was the center heart catching. So it was basically related to security at heart. When she arrived, she reported it at the station. And the guy said, "This is a very common thing. We don't know what to do." Now, this was about 30 years ago. So you can see that what has been going on in London over the last week is something which has germinated for so long and has to do with parenting and a loss of values. It's not just a law and order issue.

The other story I wanted to tell you about the train is when I was on my way to one of our meetings at Gavin's place. I went down with Shri Mataji. She was sitting here, going towards London, and I was sitting where Pat is, just in front of her. At some point I asked, "Shri Mataji, who are you?" And she said, "Ask the vibrations." So I closed my eyes and I put my hands together and waited for some time. Then I opened my eyes and she was looking at me in her own sort of Gioconda-plus, raised-to-the-power-of-divinity style. And she said, "So?" And I said, a bit disappointed, "Nothing, Shri Mataji. There is only the silence." I wanted something more. I said, "Nothing, Shri Mataji. There is only the silence." And then she told me, "That's it. I am the silence."

After that, when I walked in Victoria Station, I had an experience which would have been worthy of Mr. Pattinson. I felt that I was walking on a cushion of air. I felt like I was walking without my feet touching the ground. And that was on our way to a meeting at Gavin's. So that happened on the train here. That was a big one.

The way we got to know you mostly for the next two years was through your letters. Because you used to write to Shri Mataji about every other day, didn't you? And she used to read some of the bits out to us.

Oh, really? So we felt you were there with us.

And I was living for her letters. Kathmandu was quite funny. We really had a good time together. Another funny episode: at some point, Mother came back. I was sitting in my office, and there is an Indian gentleman who comes and says, "I'm looking for Mr. de Kalbermatten." And I said, "Yes, I am." I thought he was some guy from the office, so I was not particularly courteous. I said, "Yes, what's going on?" And he said, "My name is Rommel Varma." And I said, "Yes. And?" And then he says, "I'm the son-in-law of Shri Mataji." Then I jumped one meter. And I said, "What?" And he said, "Yes. And she's here." I didn't know she was coming. "What do you mean she's here?" "She's in a taxi."

So I rushed out of my office, and there was a place in the middle of the U.N. compound where all the drivers stay. And Mother was sitting in the back of this little Toyota taxi. So I kneeled on the ground in the middle of the compound and I put my head in the car on her feet. You can imagine the U.N. drivers thinking, "What's going on?"

During that trip, she came twice. And it was really nice, because she cooked for me. All my electric appliances were not working, so she cooked on the fire. And also once, she asked me, "Grégoire, where are the legs of the chicken?" And I said, "The leg of the chicken?" Because in Nepal, they do things in a weird way, and I never had any meat on my chickens. I had only bones. And I thought that's the way they do it here. She said, "Grégoire, you are so naive. For all this time, your cook has been bringing the best pieces of chicken to his family. And you are just eating the bones." And she knew it. I didn't know, of course. So I was so furious, I fired the cook the next day. I had not noticed that the chicken had no legs.

Even that, she turned into something. You were there when we were doing all the Havan all together?

We've got photographs. Yeah, I have one of them. And that's why I try to tell people, some people do Havan at meetings and go away. And you know how she said you should cover your head and never go out. They'd get a really good dose. We were actually under there with her. It was incredible.

And going out to that picnic where we went to visit... the purse incident.

Yeah, I put that in the book.

You put that in the book, but there is a little episode. Because Shri Mataji told me after that, that I have to start Sahaja Yoga with them. And this was a bunch of kids, 10, 12 years old. So I was saying, "How?" I invited the boys to my home. And you know what? They stole my wallet. I said, "That's it."

Well, now you've repeated the purse incident.

That was it. I didn't start Sahaja Yoga in Kathmandu. At some point, I had an old ambassador who got interested, but I really couldn't. Sahaja Yoga started eventually, but after me. Liz Lott did a lot of work.

Do you remember that dog you had, Sidon? He would sit on the Kundalini. You said, "Get out, get out." But my son said, "No, no, no. He's showing me where the Kundalini is."

Oh, I didn't remember that. And another very interesting thing. We were out in the garden, and the dog's out there sort of sniffing around. And she said, "Sit." And the dog sat. Quite amazing.

Well, the interesting thing about Kathmandu is that's where we saw lots of hippies. And we were all terrified, because we had so recently come from that.

Mother actually laughed a lot about that. You put it in your book also. There were some hippies and she wanted a yogi to work on them. She turned, and you were terrified and you were drawn away because the last thing you wanted...

Yeah, that was in India. I remember... I think his name was David. He was playing guitar, and he was brought into Finchley. He was a hippie. At some point he tore the picture of Shri Mataji. He was actually in a bad state. And then I took him down the staircase. You remember that? I took him down the staircase and then threw his mattress after him.

I remember him. He went completely mad. I was in that top room and I heard this pounding up the stairs. And he burst into the room and he was doing funny leaps like this. Then there was a pounding up the stairs after him, and you burst in and said, "Where is he? I'll kill him. I'll kill him."

Yes, because he had torn a picture of Shri Mataji in front of me.

I was sharing a bunk with him. Poor thing. I give you a bunk... I'm still doing that.

But Lindsay and David Baxter... David apparently died. The rumor is he died and left money to Sahaja Yoga, but I don't know. David Baxter was a willing person. His problem was he couldn't stop being a reporter. And so he wanted to investigate Sahaja Yoga. He was too inquisitive to just accept.

The irony was that when he got his realization, he had an incredibly powerful experience. In fact, he rang the ashram three days after getting it and said, "How long does this last? Because I can't do much work with it."

But sometimes I think each of us had the feeling at some point she brought us to such a high point. And then we had the feeling, "No, not now." We felt we can't stay there now, we need to come down because there is work to do. Otherwise, when you are there, that's it. I think that's why they say... I'm not saying we are Bodhisattvas, but the Bodhisattva is somebody who is there, and then he comes down because of compassion. We were not there because it's our level; we were there because she showed it to us. She put us there.

She actually said once to us that it was not that difficult to achieve these high states, but that she had actually caused it to be put on hold because she needed the work done.

Otherwise, we would just be in meditation.

Today, I think that it's very important to help. And I think that all of us can be helpful by telling the yogis that we are in Sahaja Yoga for Satchitananda. That's what we are in Sahaja Yoga for. And then if we do other things like school or this project or that project, fine, no problem. Let's do it. But let's keep the perspective. Otherwise, we are going to end up in a couple of years building some sort of religion with administrators. This is the temptation which is now put on us. We are coming out of this Catholic thing that has been going on for 2,000 years. It's the most successful religious institution which ever existed—2,000 years of being a state represented by the United Nations and a complete fallacy. Spiritually, it's a complete fallacy. And now it's ending up with priests and little boys and other disgusting stuff.

So, I think when we have all this historical experience, Mother put us in a homeopathic situation where we are being given a bit of the poison, a bit of the temptation to organize, to administer. And we need to handle that from a spiritual point of of view. If you run away and do nothing and play guitar alone, it's not enough either. It's the balance which we need to achieve.

And also, we die. That's the feeling that I get. If we're not actively doing Sahaja Yoga, you can't just sit back and say there are others, or I'll meditate. You have to give realization. But one of the hardest things about Sahaja Yoga has been the mediocrity, I think, of a lot of the people that you come up against. The difficulty in communicating. We feel so frustrated.

The reason I wrote that book was that when we moved down to Essex, we were doing local meetings in that town. And in ten years, we didn't establish one yogi. And I remember thinking, if we could have just got one a year, it would have been worth it. That's our lot. I just felt we've got to try it over a... because one of the problems with Sahaja Yoga is it's such a vast thing. And it's hard to get that across in a little room with three ladies and some cakes.

But if we say this and people hear you saying that, they may think we are arrogant because we speak about mediocrity. But there was a speech of Shri Mataji in Italy where she said 50% of the yogis are mediocres, 25% are idiots, and the rest, I don't know now. I mean, I pull my hair, but I didn't say that, right? It means that it's not a picnic. People need to invest. It's like good Swiss banking, which doesn't exist anymore. You need to invest in Sahaja Yoga. You cannot just be a consumer of Sahaja Yoga.

Actually, we had a good seminar at the farm a few weeks ago for new people. And we had some really good new people for a change. It was almost like being back in the '70s. Three or four of them stood up and basically recognized what was going on. They turned to each other, then turned to us and said, "Well, why didn't you tell us?" But it was amazing. We call them retreats. Because the problem is, trying to get them from the little meeting, or even the big meeting, to the puja—the leap is just too big. So we said, "Come to this retreat." And during the eight hours, by the end, everything had been reached. It was like how Mother took you: she talked to you, she fed you, she coached you. But also, we did things all day. It wasn't just lectures; it was vibrations, foot soaking, everything. By the end of the day, they were fine.

When we were in the USA, we had so-called seminars, which is the same thing. And it was a full weekend, because it's nice to spend a night. But we didn't know... the American Sahaja Yogis, like all Sahaja Yogis in the world, are more or less broke. So we were looking for the cheaper places. And after a certain number of seminars, we realized that all the cheaper places where we went were the places where the mentally retarded used to have their summer gatherings. So we had the most amazing nightmares during the night. We went on clearing these places where you had the really heavy-duty people. But still, it did work.

Now, for me, England is part of the magic. It's fine to go to Cabella, but I think we should also allow pujas in Cabella in the summer, but maybe we should also return to what happened when Shri Mataji was traveling. Maybe have one puja in the UK, one in the Americas. We need a puja in the UK next year, definitely. It would be really, really good.

You were explaining about how high you were taken by Mother and then how you had to come down, because you were saying that was the ultimate consciousness. But you had to come down to function, to be in life. Isn't that our destination, to be in that state all the time? How high can we go before we become ineffective?

You can only have fantasies. For me, the way I view things is that for Shri Mataji, Sahaja Yoga was an experiment. And now you're going to be shocked, but she actually didn't know exactly the way it could happen. Why? Because in the entire universe, man is the random factor because of freedom. She knows how the animals, how the stones, how the planets, how the angels, she knows exactly how they're going to behave. But she can't exactly know how human beings are going to behave because of the freedom. And that's the entire interest of God for man. That's the play. That's the lila. Because otherwise, where is the fun? When you play cards, the nature of the play is that you don't know the cards of the other guy. So when there is the lila for God, human beings are the only ones who keep their cards. And she has made it like that.

So from that point of view, I don't think that it's so clear-cut. But one fantasy that a guy had—and I tell you this as a fantasy, but it's an interesting one—is a dream. I know him because I met him in Thailand. His name is Engelbert. And he had an amazing vision in Vashi after being very sick. The idea is that in 2012, there would be something metabolic happening and that we would stop catching so much. Because just now, what happens is, as soon as we're a little bit better, we clear ourselves after puja, and then, bam, we catch again. We function like washing machines all the time. So with this, we can't really go higher. Because as soon as we take a little altitude, boom, we are again caught up. And that has been happening for the last 30 years.

But if that process of catching gets removed, then we will start stabilizing into our real nature. And then you will have a parting of the way. In Satya Yuga, in the Golden Age, on one hand, you have the gods who look good, and you have the demons who look ugly. Now, it's the contrary. People who look good are demonic, and people who are on the good side look rather lost. So you are going to have a parting of the way where evil people are going to be clearly evil, and good people are going to be clearly good. And in the Apocalypse of John, between the manifestation of Shri Kalki and Armageddon, there are 1,000 years.

So, again, it's fantasizing. You could say that with Krita Yuga and everything, maybe this is the start of the manifestation of Shri Kalki, of which nobody knows anything, including me. But between this moment, which is a moment of destruction—which is the incarnation of Shri Kalki—and Armageddon, which is the true final victory over evil, you have 1,000 years. So maybe this 1,000 years will be a period where gradually all the people of God, the men and women of God, will assemble, which is not yet the case because they are scattered. And evil people will be evil. And then at some point, we'll have the final thing. So you can fantasize, but don't quote me, because I don't know.

But also, I think that to cope with these high states, it has to happen gradually. You have to build up capacity to deal with it.

You come out of the station, you go to the left onto the road. Then, there's a very short road. And then, at the end of that, you go to the right. And that is called Oast Road. And then it's Oast House Road. Basically, you follow Oast Road around. It goes up and sort of around to the left.

Who was there when we had this little puja in the garden with this picture? At some point, she took a boot and she tied it to the tree.

I didn't see that, but I remember talking about tying it to the tree.

And then she wanted to have the tree cut down or something and had an argument with the council. Because it's protected or something.

But you know, it's just in the invisible world, if Mother puts a bond on a being which is disincarnated, the being is stuck there for thousands of years until he's released. So, you know, it was all a bit science fiction, but it happened.

Is it this one? This is Oxted. How long since you've been here?

Here? 35 years, at least. Well, 1975, do the math.

In this house, when Mother was in this house, you can say Sahaja Yoga started in the world. Because before, it was only in India. And she started Sahaj in the world from this house. That's the story. All the next houses or flats, it had picked up already. This is where it started. This is where it began. When we went to Gavin's house, it then started to grow. But as it got bigger, so it moved further and further. It went to Gavin's, and then it went to Ealing...

Then you had Caxton Hall.

Well, Caxton Hall was October 1977. That was the first public meeting, and then it entered a different sort of phase. This was a period of something completely private. It wasn't a movement. It was a bunch of lost people huddling together around her. That was that.

It was like a palace. It just felt like a palace with Mother in it. It was amazing, completely. It was like stepping into another world. We spent a long time, really, in another world. And the light was golden. The light inside was golden. There was a statue of Shri Krishna and a Shiva on the mantelpiece.

This back garden was where she washed our feet. Remember that picture? It was such a difficult moment, such an awe-inspiring moment, but so difficult.

I had a moment... this is actually quite private. I never told this story to anyone. I had come for the first time, and at some point, I was resting in a bedroom. And we were just resting in our underpants. And then she came in the room, very, very shy, because I wasn't dressed. But I felt like in the story where the mother of Duryodhana looks at her son and protects him because of the power of her glance. I felt like her glance was completely refreshing and granting me innocence again. I was brought immediately to the state of a child. Right there.

That little bit sticking out, that was C.P.'s little den, his little office. There was a false door in the lounge that you couldn't see, but if you knew where it was, you could open it.

The salon upstairs is where we had the "workout," where she was working on us, having us sitting at her feet, putting coconut oil and massaging our heads. At some point, I had a little puja. She asked me to do a little puja of her. And she was standing in the thali with the water. And then I asked her, "Mother, can I drink the water?" And she said, "Yes." So I was like this, before her, drinking the water like this.

You always took everything so literally.

But after that, I felt rather... that's where the vocabulary stops. It was something else.

What was the first puja you had here?

We had sort of little pujas that seemed to be taking place all the time. We did have a big puja, but it lasted about two days.

I think the first time we had a puja for everybody, a sort of puja for a collective, was at Gavin's flat. That's where Mother was sat on the sofa with flowers.

We had the first Havans that we had here, didn't we? We sat out on the terrace in the back. Mother sat cross-legged on the ground. We read a thousand names. And Mother was raging because none of us could understand Sanskrit.

We were so completely clueless. I think that was our protection. Absolutely. We didn't know until we went to India. We had no idea about protocol.

Mother tried lots of experiments with us. I remember you were there, Maureen, where we went to this town hall where there were so many Indians. And Pat was there also, and we had to do the stick dance and we couldn't do it. You remember that? Mother wanted us to meet the Indian community.

Wasn't that the one where they didn't respect her properly?

There was one where they didn't respect her, they didn't recognize her properly. All these Indians jumping nimbly and perfectly, and we were like bears in the circus in the middle. But that was supposed to cross-fertilize the intercontinental relationship, I suppose.

And you remember once some sort of hippie or someone organized a program for Shri Mataji. We had to take a train. It was quite far, in a big room. There were only five or six people in there. I saw the hall was empty. I told Shri Mataji, "Mother, please go back to London. I'll give the program," because I felt so embarrassed to have asked her to come all the way. And she said, "No, I will give the program." And from that on, whenever there is nobody coming to a program of mine, I say, okay, if she's Adi Shakti and she has five people, even if I have one cat, I should be blessed.

Mind you, I was really amazed at how many people came to Caxton Hall the first time. It filled up. It was amazing, wasn't it?

And at the end, we had the Royal Albert Hall full. And what I find telling is that after a Royal Albert Hall program, you guys organized a huge follow-up in Holland Park. And Shri Mataji said, "Please take Sahaja Yoga seriously because very little time is left." When she says that, I say, "Wait a minute, time goes on forever. What does she mean?" So there is an eschatological dimension, that there is a deadline.

The thousand years you were talking about earlier?

Well, we don't know. The thousand years will start after that. But the Kalki manifestation could happen anytime. Everything you look at, you have the risk of systemic failure in ecosystems, the risk of systemic failures in the financial markets. For people in Bangladesh or Egypt, people know that in X years, the Nile Delta will be underwater. So that's 50 million Egyptians. Where are they going to go? It's already started.

They're just papering over the cracks. I really felt it started with the Twin Towers.

I think the Twin Tower was the beginning of something.

Eleven. The number eleven. What is it about the number eleven?

The Ekadasha Rudra. The eleven destructive powers of Shri Shiva. Long, long time back in Zurich, I asked Shri Mataji, "Mother, what about the incarnation of Shri Kalki? Is he just going to be a collective principle? Or is he going to be a physical incarnation like you?" You know what she answered? She answered, "That has not been decided yet." That was a long time back, and I never asked the question again.

When I was in the Finchley ashram with Pat and Maureen, who was bravely typing my manuscript because there was nothing like word processors then... I still have a manuscript with her own annotation. I had one or two insights in this ashram. One insight I had in the flat of David Spiro in Hampstead when I was there with Mother was that the whole apocalypse is the Catholic Church, which is what Martin Luther said. And she looked at me and she said, "Aha." Like, "Okay, you got it." That was a big thing. Because "the whore is drunk with the blood of all the saints." So that's the persecutions.

The other intuition I had was in the meditation room of the Finchley ashram with the green wallpaper. With my back against the wall in this room, I thought, "But then, Shri Mataji must be the Holy Spirit." Because never had anyone mentioned that connection before. Now, for you, it's a given fact that Adi Shakti means Holy Spirit. But at that time, nobody had. And then when I thought that, I felt the vibrationary sort of confirmation, and then I asked her. It's a big difference between fantasizing and being able to check.

And the third one, which I still don't quite understand, is because I wondered what is the relationship between us and Shri Kalki. Because she's giving birth to us, but Shri Kalki is the incarnation. So what does it mean? And then I came up with this notion that the host of Shri Kalki is the collective consciousness of the yogis. And again, I brought this to her as a hypothesis. She went through every single page of The Advent. What is there is correct. So this is why no one should try to control the host. This is why there cannot be individual leadership in Sahaja Yoga. Because you are asking for trouble.

The collective is not democracy. It's not a mob getting together and saying, "No, we don't agree." It's a consciousness. To get there, it's not all the email nonsense going on and rumors and gossips. If we all do what she asked us to do—to go inside—then we activate the host, because it's a consciousness.

The ego has to dissolve completely for it to manifest. Ego and superego, both. To be a perfect instrument, you must be completely surrendered. There are two gates at the Agnya Chakra. The gate on the left side, which corresponds to Mahavira, is the gate which is opened through faith. The antidote against the problems of the left side is to have faith in oneself, which is not easy. Faith in Shri Mataji is easier. And faith in the collective is a bit more difficult, but it's still easier than faith in oneself. Faith is the opening of the left side of the gate, and surrender is the opening of the right side, which is the ego. So we need these two. And that's why Christ spoke about faith a lot.

Leadership will always exist. Mother used leaders. She said, "I use leaders, because otherwise, all your egos would go up." And also this fashion that everybody now is a leader... no, everybody is your own guru. It's not the same as everybody is a leader, because then you have anarchy and nothing is done. Sometimes you're the leader, and sometimes you enjoy the play. You can enjoy someone else being the leader. You enjoy the fact that it's not on your shoulders. It's a function, not a status. And when you are in that position of a leader, you don't get an ego about it. You are an enabler and a facilitator.

It's interesting for me, because Mother made me the first so-called "world leader," and it sounded like a joke. She called me on the podium at the Guru Puja in Andorra and she asked me to sit before her with my back to her. And I sat there, and I did something like, "Now what's going to happen to me?" And everybody saw me and laughed. Because why do you need a world leader if Mother is there?

But what Shri Mataji wants after her departure is collective leadership. This is my own understanding of Sahaj. She said one day that the bit in the Bible where Christ said to St. Peter, "You are Peter, and on this stone I will build my church," is a fallacy. She said it in Migliano. "How could Christ have done such a mistake? How could Christ have given all the powers to a single person? I would never do such a mistake." She said it. So when she said it, I said, "Good, now it's clear."

The recent, last great pujas were with Shri Mataji, the Adi Shakti puja. And what happened is that there is one guy from the UK who was supposed to bring The Advent books. But the only chance to sell the books in the UK was at the puja. I saw the books for sale and The Advent wasn't there. I asked, "Why aren't the books there?" And someone said, "Well, the car of the guy who was supposed to bring the books broke down." So I sat there quite dejected. I said, "Mother, I can write the book, but if the car breaks down..." I was really sulking.

And then an English yogini came from the back. She came from here and she had the sun behind her, so she had the sun through her hair. She said, "Did you go in the exhibition of William Blake?" And I said, "No." And she said, "Okay, come and sit." She was just taking me at that moment. So I go in the exhibition of William Blake and then I see the story of Job. And then I was so moved, because I was thinking, "Now here is the one who threw Satan into hell. The commander-in-chief of the angelic hosts. Who wrote on his diary the word 'despair.' And who couldn't buy soap because he was so broke." And everybody thought he was mad. And I said, "My God." And Kartikeya locked himself in a cave... I mean, that was Jnaneshwara, who was the incarnation of Kartikeya. So when you see what they went through, and Grégoire sits and he's pissed off because the car broke down... it really put things in perspective.

We've had it easy, really. We had it easy. Sometimes we feel it was a bit tough because some of us had a bumpy road. But if you look at things in perspective, we had it very easy.

We had a bumpy road because of our own faults.

Yeah, but what I mean is, if we could have let it all go in an instance, we'd have had a smooth road.

Maybe, but we were working out karma, individual and collective. I had my own karma. I have a karma of an arrogant race I have to deal with. This exists.

Actually, Maureen is right. In America once, because everyone has a yo-yo—an expression that Shri Mataji used for me, "You go up and down like a yo-yo"—I said, "Shri Mataji, I feel like a doggy out in the rain." And she said, "Yes, but there is always an umbrella following you." So, it's very cute. And basically, we take things too seriously.

The level of our vibrations has increased so much. We go to these Mind and Body shows now and we are in charge. We can be there all weekend and feel incredible. The vibrations were very strong. So something is moving and something is happening. It used to be the reverse. The muck was up here and we were down like this. And now we're up here and they're down there. They are all coming to our stall to get realization, exhausted and finished. So it's very good.
