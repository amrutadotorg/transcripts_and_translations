I bow to all the seekers of Truth. The inauguration of this school is also for the children seeking the Truth. When Surdas(16th-century Indian saint-poet) wrote his (Epic Book)‘Sursagar’,after he finished writing, then in the end he said, Nandlal (Lord Krishna, The name Nandlal means "beloved son of Nanda," referring to Nanda Maharaja, Shri Krishna's foster father) please remove all the ignorance of surdas. After writing everything he wrote Nandlal, please remove all the ignorance of surdas. Kabir Das ji has written, it is said, the learned one has become a fool by learning. When in my childhood I read his(Kabir’s) couplet, I said what is he writing that the learned one has become a fool by learning. How can the learned become fool by learning? And we send our children (to school) for learning. So will they all become fools? After that I met many people in life who had become fools by learning. It means when you only read and write, then whatever you understand is through your intellect and logic and this intellect and logic affects us in many ways. Like whatever our parents taught us since childhood, whatever this environment has taught us, whatever was filled in our mind, all that creates its space in our intellect and then whatever we read or write then we see it from the same vision that we had acquired since childhood. And we see at the same level, where we are standing. Because of this, whatever we read we use it in the same way we want, because our intellect is very sharp. This intellect can also cheat us. It is so smart and we should avoid it. That’s why they have said the learned one has become a fool by learning, because a man slips from reality. He doesn’t look towards reality. When his intellect becomes so strong that he uses all kinds of logic as Shri Adishankaracharya had said ‘web of words’, he gets entangled in a web of words and feels suffocated in words and distorts the words. He then resorts to some style that there is no similarity between the word and the meaning. This thing I have observed in this world, especially in India which is a Yoga Bhumi(Land of Yoga), is a great country. Only those (people) can understand its greatness who have experienced the spirit. Anyone who has not experienced the spirit cannot understand how great this country is. Once we were coming to India from London, My husband was also with Me. I said, look, we have touched our India. He said how did you know? I said, there is chaitanya flowing everywhere. He said, Is it? He went and asked the pilot, have we entered India. He said, just one minute back we have touched India. This is our India. It is such a great land, we have no idea about it. 

Actually the other countries are like grown up trees, they have grown but their roots are in this country, in our country. They never searched for their roots and are today sitting waiting to get reduced to ashes, waiting to get bombed by an atom bomb and then all the nations could get destroyed because they have no roots. But when the roots are in our country then it is our heritage, is our inheritance. Is inheritance. We must know this that what we have got, what we have lost and what we have to look for. So many great sages, saints have been born here.  Till recently, till Shirdi’s Sai Nath, we can say, very great monks and saints had taken birth and explained that, search for your spirit. Nanak Sahab had said, Nanak says without knowing your Self, the illusion of the mind is not destroyed. I will ask the Sikhs, what are you doing? You are just cramming. Nanak says without knowing your Self the illusion of the mind is not destroyed. But who will know the Self. The same I will tell the Hindus, who have been told that Spirit is everything, search for the spirit. Nothing else has been said, you may read all the Vedas. The meaning of Vedas is ‘Vid’. ‘Vid’ means, to know on your nerves. On your nervous system the Spirit is to be felt. They have said, those who have not experienced it for them Vedas are useless. Then why to read vedas. But what are Hindus doing?

Christians have been told very clearly by Christ that you should be born again. Then Nicodamus asked, what is the meaning of being born again, do I have to enter into my mother’s womb again? They said, no.Whatever is born of this flesh will be flesh, but what is born of the spirit, of the Adishakti, of the Holy Ghost meaning born of Kundalini will be, only he will be like spirit and that you have to become. You have to be like the spirit. All have said that you have to be the spirit. There is no religion which has not said this thing, I am not saying anything new.

But if we are the spirit then the spirit is the one in all the beings. It is the reflection of one Divine. In everyone resides one spirit. So we have to know that spirit and this nobody talks about. Everybody is talking about useless things. They are talking about the fruit which has no juice. So by eating such fruits, what are we going to get? Our forefathers ate such fruits, their great grandfathers ate such fruits. Now is the time to obtain the real stuff. One must get the real gem.  Every saint has said this. I am not saying anything new. Is there anyone, who has not said this? The only difference is that it had not materialised within us. This is a happening within us, it's a power. This has to be awakened. So long as this power is not awakened, we will not be able to understand it. Therefore this power should be awakened and we must get to the spirit.

Now there is an appropriate time to awaken this power. When the time comes then only this work gets done. That’s why this time has come and we should not spoil our lives by indulging in useless things. There are some people who do not believe in God. Some people believe in God as it leads to quarrels. Other people believe in God as it benefits them. In believing God they will say, God please correct this, please correct that. But nobody thinks that we should believe in God so that His power comes within us. God’s power should come within us. And the biggest thing is that when the spirit gets awakened then we can no longer believe in the outer religions. Because when the inner religion gets awakened, which was of Shri Nanaka Sahab, of everyone, that religion, which is inside, which is human religion, we start believing in that. We only believe in human religion and when we believe in human religion then all the emotions, animosity, tendency to trouble others, quarrel, aversion, everything gets destroyed within us. Till this happens, transformation will not come. From superficial things nothing gets resolved.

Now you see the muslims killed the Hindus. What have they achieved? What special have they achieved? Are they sitting comfortably in Pakistan? Or hindus who killed others, are they sitting comfortably? What have they achieved? What does one achieve by this beating? Just now Mr Yogi(Mahajan) questioned Me, Mother, if someone resorts to violence, hits us then is it appropriate to hit him back or not. I said, look, a sword never fights another sword. A shield fights the sword. Make your shield bigger. One should stay(protect oneself) with the shield. Do you know that our country has never attacked any other country? Even then our power is maintained till now. When we assume the role of shield then our power increases and of the other person it gets destroyed and he thinks he should also make his own shield.

And our shield is our Spirit. We have to awaken this spirit. And that does not get awakened by any debate, by any apprehension or by any other thing. This is something which is Sahaja(spontaneous). Sahaja means which is born with you, which is spontaneous. Like there is a seed, it sprouts by itself. You sing bhajans before it(seed)or don’t sing, you may say anything to him that we believe in formless or we believe in form. The seed will say I am not concerned. I have come to my mother’s womb and I have to sprout. That is my nature. 

In the same way you have your kundalini within you that gets awakened by itself. Nothing is required to be told to it(kundalini), nothing is required to be explained to it. It is waiting eagerly to get awakened.

You should think about it. When we have this power within us and it can be obtained (awakened), then why not obtain it. Once you obtain it then your real power of religion gets increased within you. The power of religion is never for fighting.

The power of religion is the one which if one has, then nobody can dare to point a gun at him. This is the power of religion. Like once Jesus Christ saw one prostitute woman on the road. Everyone was throwing stones at her. So He went and stood in front of her. He said(to the crowd), whoever has never committed a sin should throw stones at Me. Then nobody threw stones at Him.

When Shri krishna went to the war, He was unarmed. He said I shall go unarmed. When He was unarmed in the war, nobody saw Him being hit with arrows, or someone had pierced Him(with an arrow). He just went there and gave His sermon of Gita when arrows were flying from all sides and swords were shining. Amongst all this He spoke Gita.

From this one should understand that when our inner power is awakened, then nothing can touch us. Because our own power is so fantastic that it melts other people. The other thing is that this power of God is the power of love. This is the power of love. Is of love and in front of love great ones surrender.

You might know about the story of Alexander, I think it happened here, in Pathankot. The incident was that his wife was an Indian lady and there was a king named Puru who used to rule here. This king Puru held him (Alexander) and conquered him somehow. People here are very smart in wars; he might have conquered Alexander and put him in jail. Now this Indian woman was very clever. She thought, "How can I help my husband get out of jail?"  So, she put a rakhi (thread) in a silver plate, (it was rakhi day, it was rakhi Poornima on that day) she covered the plate and sent it.

When Puru saw that a rakhi had been sent to him, he asked to tie it on his hand and then he asked, who is my sister?  He was told that Alexander’s wife is your sister. He felt very ashamed of himself after realizing that she is his sister. Now see, just because of this rakhi, he went to Alexander and released him from the jail and with full respect he presented him to his wife and he said I am very sorry, you can take all the gold and silver which has been looted from you, please also take whatever you have looted from us and please forgive me and he made him sit on this own throne.

Now Alexander got confused as there is no such culture in his country. He couldn’t understand anything that at one point I was in jail and I was thinking of conquering the whole India and why this man is giving me so much respect, nothing went into his head as there is no such concept of (respect for) mother and sister in his country. When he went to his home his wife was smiling, he asked her what did you do? She said nothing, just a small sutra (thread). He asked on which sutra did you catch him? She said in our country brothers and sisters share a strong bond of love. He asked, how is he your brother? She said because of a thread, I sent him a small thread just because of that he became my brother. He asked how this happened? She made him understand that here in our country on rakhi poornima if a lady sends a thread (to a boy) then he becomes her brother. He said Oh my God! If this country is shaken on such small threads, then I cannot rule here. This is a very great country and he along with his whole army left via Karachi and said I don’t want this. If you go to Athens, there people will tell you about this incident. Alexander said that no one can conquer India because this is the land of the divine, where people released me from jail just because of a thread, even though I was about to conquer the whole country saying how does it matter if my sister’s husband rules here, we will lose nothing. This country with all its greatness and its culture – forgetting this culture, what are we even doing? We should think about it. This was not very long ago when Alexander came to our country and till now, they think very highly of this country.

When I went to Greece, people used to tell me about this, so many people used to come to see me. I asked why all these people have come to see me? They said we were told that you are very Indian, you stay in a pure Indian way, we came to see why Alexander used to praise India so much. He took Chandrabardayi with him from India, he also wrote so many poems on this. The glory of our country Bharat is recognised across the entire world. We don’t know how great we are, what is our greatness and what we have achieved. What our saints and sages have given us, and we are fighting for such petty things. I cannot understand why we are ignoring our internal treasure. We have such a treasure that we should tell these children about it.

Those children who do not know about their country how they will be able to love their country? What is the greatness of our country and how people made sacrifices to get the freedom of this country? And after achieving freedom, we are acting like a bull that has broken free from a prison, attacking everyone. That is how we are all fighting among ourselves.

You will only understand this when you attain your spirit because your spirit gives you collective consciousness which makes you understand that you all are one. The same God almighty resides within all of you, until you know this in your central nervous system. Because when this happens you will be surprised your hands will know, you will know on your fingertips what is the problem with others and what is the problem with your own self.

That is what he was saying that I can cure illness, I don’t do anything, actually what happens is when someone comes to me and puts his hands towards me like this, his kundalini gets awakened, his kundalini is his mother she only cures him. Where did I cure him? Let’s say this is mother earth and we sow a seed in this - it grows itself, then does this earth say that I have grown this seed? It is the quality of the seed and the quality of the earth due to which it germinates. In this process what did the earth do and what did the seed do? It happens spontaneously on its own, according to nature.

This energy is within us - you Indians have got this specially. You must know this as well, that to be born in this country you must have performed thousands and thousands of virtuous deeds in your past lives, otherwise you wouldn’t have been born here. Because you don’t know all these things you can’t be a true Indian, these fights are only because of this. First be an Indian then you can be a universal being. If you are not an Indian, how can you be a universal being?

We have so many centers in the whole world where Sahaja yoga is practiced. These people come here to explore India and travel in villages. They say the joy which we experience here we don’t experience anywhere else. These people travel in forests and villages, they stay at such places where there is no bathroom or anything at all, they stay at these places and still remain so joyful. I told them you have so many comforts there (in their country), here you don’t get so many comforts. They said, here we get joy of the spirit, comfort of spirit, we have had enough of comforts of the body, we don’t want that now, we want comfort of the spirit. The moment we attain our realisation we have the feeling of contentment and you will be surprised, like Shri Krishna has said yogakshemam vahamyaham - first you get connected and then you get all the blessings. Blessings in all aspects financially, mentally, emotionally, physically in all aspects we get blessings. All this is promised to you by Shri Krishna, and then to say Nanak Sahab did not believe in Ram at all is incorrect. He believed in Ram and he believed in Krishna too, he believed in every body. But at that time Hindus had completely immersed themselves in bowing to any idol they saw, any priest came, this happens even today if a pandit or a priest comes and starts exploiting people, they will blindly follow him. Due to these conflicts and so called Brahminism which has spread so much, they started to talk about those things like if we talk about flowers, you get honey from flowers, so he talked about flowers but people got stuck with flowers.

Just like Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh all these powers are within us, by simply giving names to these powers there is nothing wrong. People started fighting over the names given to these powers. Some one started worshiping Brahma, someone started worshiping Vishnu and someone else worshipped someone else. Then, after worshiping, they picked up some stones and turned it into an idol. It became so big that he said let’s talk about the formless (Nirakar). So, he started talking about the formless. He said you talk about honey not the flowers, so he started talking about honey. When he started talking about honey. Once the talk about honey began, people just kept talking about honey. It’s all just talk, no religion remains. Wherever you go, its only talk of honey, singing hymns, doing akhand paath(uninterrupted, continuous recitation of the entire Siri Guru Granth Sahib, the holy book of Sikhism), there also only they are talking.

The same thing happened with Arya Samaj also. They talked about the formless, now the whole thing is all about the formless. First the talk was about flowers and now too it’s about the formless, it’s about the honey. You have to be the seeker (Madhukar), until you become the seeker you cannot get the honey. You should understand this, that everybody (all the prophets) all the time just said that you should get the honey. Nanak Sahab has done everything very cautiously that he included all the realised souls that were there in India like Marathi poet Naam deva in Granth Sahib. Not even a single person is there in Granth Sahib who is not a realised soul. You all might know that Kabir das ji’s guru was a Hindu, he went to Ramanand swami and Ramanand swami helped him in his spiritual ascent. His guru was a Hindu, so Nanak Sahib made Granth Sahib including all the realised souls who were there at that time. Now unless you actually go deep into teachings of Granth Sahib and understand what has been written in it, it is like someone giving you a prescription for a headache, saying take this medicine but if you don’t actually take that medicine, how will your headache go? If you just kept chanting, take this medicine, take this medicine, will your headache go? Unless you actually do what he has said, how will it ever happen? They said recognise thy self only then the veil of illusion will vanish, we should look into that direction. We haven’t even recognised our own self. What they taught us we should actually follow. Kabir das ji has also said the same thing. If anyone in north India has spoken about kundalini it is these two saints, and no one else has spoken about this(kundalini). Adi Shankaracharya in the sixth century has spoken much about this but since it was all in sanskrit language it didn’t spread much in North India. Brahmins accepted some of it or didn’t but in South or in Maharashtra so many people know about these teachings, because the Nath Panthis were there, like Machhindernath and others worked on these, that is why people of Maharashtra know very much about kundalini. But if you go to the north, I used to study at a medical college in Lahore and once I spoke to someone about kundalini, they asked Is kundalini and kundli the same thing? Kundli is very different and kundalini is different. There is such ignorance here in this region but despite this ignorance, people have done remarkable work here. Nanak Sahab himself lived in Punjab; this place has got its name due to him. In such a sacred place, one should attain self-realisation, that alone is the true religion rest everything is not religion, everything is ignorance. And because of this, when a school is established here where children can attain this knowledge, you’ll see their character will become exceptional. In reality people in our country are good, much better than other countries. You don’t know what is the condition in other countries. We think that English people are very happy or people in America are very good but they are very miserable. Half of them will go directly to hell, you know it from me now and amongst the rest some are even on the verge of committing suicide. Now you see Norway, Sweden and Switzerland, they all are very wealthy nations, People there have cars, some even have three cars, they have houses and everything, they are rich, and still their children are on the verge of committing suicide. So, what is there to take from them?  The only thing we can learn from them is that money cannot make a person truly happy. What brings true happiness is peace of the spirit. And when you attain that inner self, you will be amazed to find yourself entering in the kingdom of God and the moment he sees your doubts and struggles, he begins to help you in such a way that you’re surprised at how you are able to get everything so easily. You should experience this yourself, enter in the kingdom of the divine. You believe in God, but you have not found him. When you will find him, you will truly believe, because when you experience him, you will be amazed at how he can uplift you beyond your imagination. The life of foreign Sahaja yogis has changed so much that it is hard to believe. These foreigners, their lives have transformed so much, their souls have become so pure as if lotuses have bloomed from the mud. They have become so beautiful within and they have such deep respect for you. They think that all Indians must be saints. But we know the reality, who is going to tell them. But it is true that most people here are good, great people. It is the good deeds (wealth) of our ancestors because of which we are people of very high calibre. Our beliefs and our thoughts are of very high nature but sometimes we also get trapped in certain foolishness, that is another matter. But in essence, we are truly of very high order. And the only way to maintain that height is to keep our eyes upwards, to remain elevated, to keep our vision fixed on the spirit.

So today, don’t know (if) we have self realisation programme? Ok, in one or two minutes this work gets done instantaneously. So you take off your shoes and I especially wanted to say to Mr Singh that I have seen that Rajput( a large, diverse group of patrilineal clans primarily found in western, central, and northern India) people receive their self realisation very fast. I don’t know how, but these Rajputs, because I too, My ancestors were Raput, but later they settled in Maharashtra. Maybe it is because of that, but Rajput people, I have seen that they get their self realisation very fast. So I don’t know what is it about Rajput people that they keep their dignity and in armed forces also there are many Rajputs and all these people who are of Singh caste(surname "Singh" is widely associated with Sikhism and the Kshatriya (Rajput) caste) that they consider lion as of their own caste(Singh means lion) who is the conveyance of the Devi. Here it is the conveyance of the Devi. Whether it is their faith in the conveyance of the Devi or whatever it is, we have seen many (people) like that Rajput people get their self realisation very fast and people of Kshatriya (warrior or ruling class in the traditional Hindu social system) caste receive their self realisation very fast and the reason for that could be that they are warring people but sahaja yoga is not meant for casual people.

The one who is brave, Devi is called ‘Veermata’(Mother of the brave children), it is not the work of cowards. The one who has power within, who can face it, he will get to the spirit. That is why She is called Veermata and the bravest entity is considered to be Shri Ganesha, that bravest among all is Shri Ganesha. So I hope that, you have said there are armed forces, many people from armed forces are also here, they shall be benefitted and all will understand it together that we all are the spirits and all our mutual conflicts will resolved from within, there shall not be any need to resolve it from outside, these by itself shall be resolved from within.

This thing should happen in our country. This fertile and green land about which has been described by Divine singers and Gods since ancient times, in it its reality should emerge. I hope that this thing starts in this small school and because sahaja yoga is a social oriented thing, its directed towards the society and as soon as Yogi(Yogi Mahajan) got his realisation, he left everything and said, Mother now I shall only do social work.

But this is solid social work. It's not like we make a school and then keep boasting about it. It is not that. It is a question of the awakening of the general public.

So long as you have not become something your sahaja yoga has not begun. You are not given any certificates in a superficial manner that you do not get any medals. The only thing that happens is that your inner spirit feels satisfied that so many spirits in this world have been awakened. From one lamp another is lit and nothing else. There is no give and take,neither is there any obligation nor any money can be paid in this. This is also within us especially among Hindus that we offer money to our Gurus. This is all useless. If any Guru demands money from you, you tell him to go away. You cannot do the marketing of God. They(Gods) are not sitting in the market. This should be understood. For this you cannot pay any money,?? Nothing can be given. This thing is there within you, you can have it and you should get it.

I feel very joyous that I could come in such an atmosphere and meet you all and it would be very good if we keep coming here again and again.

Shall I sit down now? You also sit down. Sit down.

Yogi Mahajan : Everyone, please take off your shoes.

Shri Mataji : Take off your shoes, it is a matter of a few moments. It doesn’t take long, in a moment the kundalini gets awakened. And keep both your feet on the ground. One thing is very good in our country. Howsoever much you fight among yourself, you all believe in Mother, you may not believe anything else. Everyone has the same Mother. There is no fight for the Mother.

Give Me some more water.

Everyone should sit in a relaxed way. If you want to sit on the ground, the ground is very good if you can, whichever way you feel good or you can come in front. Sit in a relaxed way. He is an Income Tax commissioner, he has come from Delhi. He is transformed, his life is transformed, his sons are also transformed. His wife just sang a song for you. Everyone is getting transformed. People of all ages are here. (Paternal)Aunt of your Vaidya sahab came only yesterday. She is writing on sahaja yoga. Sit, come sit, you please sit, sit down. Everybody should sit. Sit, there is a pit there. Come sit here. Now you have to put your hands like this, only hands like this. First of all we should be in balance. First of all,two powers are acting within us.

In this hand we have power of desire within us with which we desire and with this hand there is power of action with which we do everything. First these two should be balanced so that our desire and action are in balance, then only the kundalini rises with ease. Therefore first put your left hand towards Me and right towards the right towards the Mother, towards the Mother Earth. Towards Mother India, right hand , right hand. Actually everywhere they say right and left differently, so I will say right hand, right hand.

Now put your right hand towards Me and left hand like this. Right hand towards Me,right hand,right hand towards Me not left hand. Higher higher. Some of you must  be feeling a little bit, cool breeze in the hand. Mohammed Sahab had said when your days of ascent will come, days of resurrection will come, your hand shall speak, (He) said it so clearly. He was also the same personality as Nanak Sahab, and there was no difference.

You know this (that) once Nanak Sahab was lying with His Feet towards Mecca. People said you are lying with your feet towards Mecca Shareef. Is it so, (then) move My Feet, then Mecca also moved with feet. It has been said very clearly. He was the same, no difference. Both are the same, the same principle.

But you see, the disciples of Nanak Sahab and disciples of Mohammed Sahab. And now they are fighting with each other. They have made a good arrangement for fighting. Some excuse is needed for human beings to fight. If not (about)you then (about)your father, we start fighting and put the blame on God.

Now put both your hands towards Me and close your eyes and look within if you are feeling a cool breeze in your hands. Both the hands. This is the speciality of Indians that on the basis of this small thing their kundalini gets awakened. But it doesn’t happen with others(Foreigners). There(In western countries) I get pain in my hands.

Hmm, got it, you will get a cool breeze in the hands. Are you getting the cool breeze, son. Is it coming?

Yes, its coming. What is there to feel shy about, it is coming. It is apparent from the eyes. Yes it is coming. This is the speciality of Indians. Sardarji(Mother addressing a sikh gentleman) are you feeling it? Put your hands like this. Isn’t it coming? Now ask, is this Brahm Shakti? Is it the formless that you call ‘Sat Shri Akal’(God is Truth)? Ask. Is this the Brahm Shakti,ask. Ask in your heart, is this the Brahm Shakti? You will feel it stronger. Keep your eyes closed, do not open your eyes. Because this is inner yoga, so attention should be inside. You are completely thoughtless. Don’t allow the thoughts to come. Thoughtless.

Hmm, are you getting it? Enjoying it? Ask those village people, those who are from villages. Village people,ask them if they are not feeling the coolness. No no who are at the back. Come in the front.

Hmm, look at Area Command(Senior Army Officer), is he feeling it.

Are you feeling it,sister. Ok, it's all right. You people are already realised. It was only necessary for Me to come, you were sitting on the shore and you rolled over to the ocean. And someone(Kabir) has said, when we are in joy, what is there to say? That is the thing.

Sardarji(Sikh gentleman) are you feeling or not?

Sikh gentleman : Sensation is there.

Shri Mataji : Sensation,yes. Put both your feet on the ground, like this. First it starts with sensation, then cool breeze is felt. It is all mentioned. This is mentioned in the books. Saleelam,saleelam meaning cool cool breeze. There is a big catch on the left here, I don’t know, left is catching.

Now don’t think. Look at Me with eyes open, don’t think. Don’t think at all.

You are realised. She is your mother, she is your kundalini.

Yes, now you must establish in this. You only have to understand this, then you see how you progress in this. You should establish it. Now the seed has sprouted, but it has to grow into a tree. Completely thoughtless, there is no thought, just see. Are you having any thoughts? Not coming? No thought is coming, isn’t it? Feeling shy, speak up. What is there to feel shy before Mother? I am Mother. What is there to feel shy from Mother. Alright?

Are all these people feeling? All these people who live here are realised. And then they are in companionship with the military, then what else is going to happen? You are the people who fight for our country. Such a great country India, so great, they are the people who are saving its honour. And what yogi(Yogi Mahajan) has said, think about that. This is not a fight between Hindus and muslims. Just think, if Indira(former Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi) has done something wrong, it is between you and her. Why are you blaming the Hindus? And Hindus should also realise what is their attachment with Indira.

Allright, if she has done something wrong or didn’t do anything wrong, you know it better. But then you are after that, it has no meaning. You are determined to do something for that, what is the meaning of all this? What is there to fight for this? That is their government, whatever the government thought right, they did that. So your fight is with the government. What is your dispute with the Hindus, I don’t understand. If you have to hit someone, you hit the government, at the most. Who else can you hit? But you should be reasonable that what is there to be upset about. What is there to weaken our country? The one who is your Mother, if you weaken her then how do you move ahead?

And you also agree that there is nothing to gain in this. I have never understood those who got Maharashtra, after fighting for it. Maharashtrians got it(their separate state), then what is their gain? Even now they are hitting each other’s head, (fortunately) you are saved. You would have broken each other’s heads. You are not doing any other work, but quarreling for this state, that state, then what saintly work you are doing? Same quarrel, same drinking liquor. These days they drink so much liquor in Maharashtra, there is no limit. Even sikhs don’t drink that much. They have left everyone behind. What good deeds have they done?They should think to themselves, after quarreling so much, they should have done some good work, but I don’t see any.

Yes, if after getting ‘Khalsa’(Khalistan-separate nation for sikhs) you really become pure(Khalis also means pure) then I would recognise you. But that is not going to happen.  After getting Khalsa, they will break each other’s heads, you will see that. I am telling you now. Have your khalsa(separate nation), half of the sikhs will be killed. Who else is going to bear the brunt of pent up anger? On their own brethren, who else? What is there in it, I don’t understand. When you see someone is not able to do anything then why the other person follows him?When you see someone coming out of a pub and he is falling, dying then why go to the pub.

Learn this, you will feel better. Some Australians have come with Me. Now how Australia is progressing, some have come from there. Like this the whole world should become one. Then only we shall enjoy.

All the time they are quarreling that their womenfolk are getting abducted, some are beating others, is this all good? Human beings have made themselves like this. The way we are nowadays, even streetdogs and cats are not like that. There is trouble in the whole world. This should be transformed and transformation can only happen if the spirit is awakened within us.

Now please try to keep it awakened, grow in its light, cherish it completely, take care of it, keep your self realisation sublime.

My eternal blessings here. I have studied in Punjab. I have a great reverence for Punjab and Guru Nanak was like a father. He was such a great man. People like Lala Lajpat Rai have lived here. So many brave people have irrigated this country with their blood. Remember all this and protect your country.
