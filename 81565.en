It's too much to bear, I know, saying that somebody can grant me such a life. And I told them we should not have said such strong things because, after all, it hurts people to think that somebody who looks like us is actually us. I won't say that was a mistake on their part. I wouldn't say that I am not required. Neither am I saying it is granted. But I would say that it would be manifested.

Let us talk in the third person. It would be a better idea to talk in the third person first of all—that it would be manifested. We think that the only thing lacking in your being is self-knowledge. Otherwise, you have sorted everything out. As far as the matter is concerned, you have sorted it out. You have gone up to the moon; you have gone up to, I don't know, the sun. I would not have done that. But even the sun's rays, everything material that is given to you has been sorted out up to the microscopic level.

On the emotional side, you have gone to the other end of things. You have gone into the emotional side to such an extent that sometimes, suddenly, you see how people have ruined themselves completely running after the emotional end of things. Then into rationality. When I see human beings, they have rationally sorted out many things, and in that, you have committed such mistakes that it is impossible to convince you that these are false ideas. Because through rationality, you cannot reach that which is an eternal and unlimited being. You cannot reach an unlimited being by your beautiful style. Anything you do, you cannot reach it. Somebody has to trigger you, or you have to be triggered.

So through rationality, you cannot reach that stage where Christ has asked you to reach, about which Shri Krishna has described that you have to know your Atma. You cannot know it by reading about it. You can't achieve any of these things through yoga, these exercises, and all that. You can know only through grace. Only through the grace of God can you know. And this is one simple thing, if we accept it within ourselves—what I call the humility of man—that we cannot know by ourselves. Because in the evolution so far, we have done nothing to become human beings. You have become a human being by yourself. Self—which self you do not know, which is the Kshetrajna, as it is called by Shri Krishna—is the one who knows the field, where it is working. It works out, but you do not know how it works out. But you know somebody who knows. You are aware that you do not know. And you have not yet been established.

So when we talk of Self-realization, rationality plays its own part to a point. Everything plays its own part to bring you to that point where the time has now come for you to do it. Even science, if you go to the extreme of science, you find it's not there. No, it's not there, it's finished. It's not there. Even spiritual people go far off; they have done this, they have done that. Have you found it? No. That denial should be there. If this denial is not there, Sahaja Yoga doesn't work. That's the thing. If you say, "No, I found it," then you better go ahead.

The thing is, it is such a sudden happening. It is such a beautiful happening that you don't feel anything as a pain or anything. But it is a sudden happening, and you will lose the suddenness just like that, like a little delicate flower. When you have to handle it, when you are spreading a little flower, you have to be attentive about it and spread it. But if you start deliberating and finding out, "How should I enjoy this flower?" it's such a gross, repelling attitude. But it is a truly sudden happening, and it works out.

I know my job. And my job is very simple. It's a very simple job that a light, an enlightened candle, can enlighten other lights. Don't think about this. Forget it. This is my job. And that's the job for which I am born. I have to live for it. I am doing it myself. When you start thinking, you think to yourself, "Why is this Mother doing it?" What can I do? That's my nature. In the same way, this question to me has no meaning. It's nature, and it has to work out. The child has to know, which has worked out now. You see, at least 50% have to tell. All of you should tell. But the other day I had an interesting report that somebody said, "No, no, we are not interested in Self-realization." Oh God.

What is Self-realization? He said you should know what Self-realization is. To a rational mind, you can understand. But we do not know it. We do not identify it. We do not actualize it. Unless and until this happens, it takes place within us, for which we are built. Only by talking about it, saying things about it, you won't get there. By reading about it, you won't get there. By the happening itself only, it happens.

It's a very simple thing. Supposing you have a stone in the stomach which has to be removed. You have to have the operation, isn't it? By reading about the stone, by reading about the doctor, by reading about the machine, by singing about it, or by talking about it, or by describing it, will you get it removed? Today, what happens to our brains, I don't know. We are not so practical about it. We do not understand that if it has to happen, it will happen within us for a change. Self—even to take the name of Self itself is God. What is Self is the reflection of God within us.

We should not say whether the mind exists or not; that is another big lecture. But by rationality, we will not know if it is happening within us. So, forget that. Put your mind to rest and let it be. As they said, young men, we need to rest and let it be. We will go away by saying, "No, not this. Let's ignore this. Let's ignore this." It's a very subtle happening, so I'm taking you down to that point. It is a reflection of God Almighty in our own being.

Now, we think that reflection can be perfected through our cleansing, through our japa, tapa, and all those things. We can cleanse our being by doing all kinds of punya, as they call it, by donating things, serving people, doing that. But have you seen anybody getting Self-realization by that? You might cleanse. You may cleanse these things, but can you get a light inside? You may want cleaning, but will you get the light inside? You cannot. You have to have the connection; that is the main thing.

Supposing you get a power by which you can see the truth. It would be even better to get the power first and then to cleanse. How do you clean a glass? Have you seen that? Do it practically. Even if you have to clean a glass, you have to take it to a light. Can you clean the glass in darkness? Can you? In the same way, you have to put it against the light. You have to have the light within you. Maybe it's a blurred light in the beginning. Maybe it's not clear, but then it's light. So this idea that we are going to clean our karma must also be used here. At the most, you can keep in the center. At the most, you can lead a good, religious, righteous, holy life. But your karmas that were there, have been there in previous lives—you cannot clear them. You cannot, by doing anything. We can say that this lamp is dirty; we can maintain that much. But if you think you can completely remove its dirt in darkness, you cannot. You have to have light to see what is dirty, what is the one that is obstructing. That's why light is first to be established, whatever may be the condition.

So this house now, supposing, is granted to me. It is in the worst possible condition. The first thing I will do is to put up a light there. Practically. Without the light, how do I enter in? Light is there. What is Self-realization? It is to enlighten that Self within me. Some people have a flickering lamp, you know. It will go off. It goes off, and it's done.

Mother has seen one thing. It's a curse. That one point, Mr. Gregoire has said, is a curse. But why do I have patience? Because you cannot imagine a person who loves, and love gives you the patience. To me, I never know that I am patient until others tell me. Because I enjoy doing things which really give you the love. So there is no give and take, no hurting of people. I am not doing anything special for you. It's my job. I am paid for it because I have the joy of the whole world. By doing this, I am achieving the greatness of goodness by itself. It's a joy that you can see the light.

It is modern times when everybody becomes creative and makes up many words. Understand a person who does something for nothing at all. Now, one thing is sure: this happening of Self-realization is not a dream. It is a reality. It is a reality. It is a reality. It is not happening to you, but once you get this light, you get the collective point. This means you start seeing another person's problem and your own problem. It's very simple. Like the light when it comes, it does two things: it sees its own field and also shows others what it can do. It automatically happens. Now what do you do about it? The character, the swabhava as we call it, and the nature of light should be. In the same way, it is built into the Atma, in the spirit. It just does. Once it starts manifesting its powers, you become aware. So what am I doing here? I'm just reporting to you how you must feel yourself.

For example, as I said, the wind starts blowing, which has been described in a complete book by Adi Shankaracharya. That cool breeze starts blowing from the hand, known as Chaitanya Lahari. Christ has described it. When somebody touched me, he said something went from my body into another's. All these things have been described. In the Bible, the new age itself is described in many, many words, but one of them is very important: "I will appear before you like tongues of flame." All these things have been described and told beforehand for the modern times, that you are born today when you cannot say these things are not needed.

But we keep them aside. In religion also, we take to new ideas, new things. But in material matters, we take to antiques. Religion should be real antiques, while material matters should be modern. Just the opposite is the trend. We take religion that is coming up modern. "Now today Mataji has come, let's have her." It's a guru shopping event. So from one Mataji to another guru, then another guru. "Now, this is the latest guru who has come on the market, you see. I think he's a very good one." That's not the judgment point. The judgment point is: what powers have you got yourself? Are you still a beggar? Have you been enriched yourself? What has your guru given you? What has he done for you? Has he given you freedom? Has he given you your power inside? That is the judgment point.

Do not get identified with any one of them, with any one of these ideas. Try to identify with yourself. Yourself is your guru. I'm not your guru; I'm your mother. I'm just your mother. But what is it to tell you? As a mother would tell you that your guru is sitting in your heart. It's the Self. It tells you. Listen to yourself, and you can only listen to yourself when you get your realization, when you start receiving information and you have a rapport, when there is a communication and when you start talking to yourself. Then only you are enlightened. Before that, religion is not known. It's complete non-knowledge. But that's what it is all in this world. You see, by raising churches, by raising temples, by raising all these things, you cannot find God. The temple is in here, in your own heart, yourself, only. The light has to be put there.

Interviewer: Shri Mataji, everyone. Shri Mataji, thank you so much for this lovely speech. And thank you, Uncle Bala, for joining us this evening to talk about your insights and enlightenment, where you got the light from Shri Mataji. It'd be nice to see the photographs and to hear an account from your diaries, which Shri Mataji has asked the yogis to do for future references. It'd be a great pleasure if you could start. First of all, thank you for joining us. And if you could tell us how it all began again with the photographs, please.

Bala: I don't know what I can say after listening to the voice of the infinite. It's like some amoeba trying to say something. But, yeah, give me a moment. That was very good meditation.

Well, in the last "Memories" video we did, I did describe some things. And I thought what I'd do this time is I took some photographs, initially not many, but I thought I'd show you where I came from, just the year that I had that special experience in '76 on Sahasrara Day. So I guess I should share the screen, maybe.

Interviewer: Yes, please do. It'd be lovely to see those times.

Bala: Okay, so this is 1976. It's the year that I had that experience where Mother said she gave me realization by remote control. To my left is a photograph of me when I was a young man. It was winter, of course, in England. And as you know, I did aeronautical engineering, so that's me on one of the aircraft at the university. For the old fans of aircraft, this is a Hawker Hunter, which was what they call a transonic jet, which means it was flying just below the speed of sound. It would sometimes go a little faster, but it wasn't designed for supersonic travel. This was in the mid-70s. So that was the year that I had that experience, which I've described in the other talk.

I met Mother the following year in '77, and this is '78, when we had a puja. This was after the experience, which was also described previously. And I'd just like to show you some of the people that yogis may not recognize. That's me in the corner here after a severe haircut compared to the last photograph. I didn't cut my hair when I went to college; seemed unnecessary.

And this is a young Gregoire here.

Interviewer: Is he wearing kajal in his eyes?

Bala: Yeah, exactly. We had to put that on. It was supposed to be a treatment. And of course, you see Mother smiling away. And this chap here on the top right was a Brahmin, who Mother used to call to recite the verses for the pujas. We had no clue what he was doing, but he said some stuff, and then we basically just washed Mother's feet. Also in the old days, in the early years, the pujas were not for a particular deity, because everything was represented in this incarnation. So he simply did a puja to Shakti, and we were just calling her Mother or Masterji. And on the left here, you might recognize this fellow. This is a young Jamel Maturi, who is now not so young, just like me. Some of the others are not in Sahaj; they kind of appeared, Mother invited them for a puja, and then they disappeared.

This is us washing the feet. And this is the Brahmin again. He wasn't fully involved, but he was a very nice man. He was probably saying the mantras with the proper delivery, chanting away, and Mother would tell him what to say. He seemed to know them all by heart. And we just did the fun part, which was washing Mother's feet. That's me in the bottom left. And this person, older yogis will know him, is Dr. Rustam, when he had just arrived in Sahaja Yoga.

It was interesting with Rustam. I'll tell you a little story. I was staying with Mother just about every weekend, and one day, she said to me, "Oh, there's a psychiatrist coming. Will you talk to him downstairs before he comes up?" So I went and saw him, and he was dressed rather differently. He looked quite dapper in a white suit and white shoes. I'd never seen anything like that. He was trying to explain to me what brought him to Sahaj and so on. He'd seen the ads, but he'd also had dreams. And he was quite a smart guy. I believe he had a medical degree and also a doctorate in psychiatry from Oxford and Cambridge. So he'd been to both of those universities.

Interviewer: He did psychiatry at both Oxford and Cambridge?

Bala: Yes, he got degrees from both Oxford and Cambridge. He was a smart cookie. I explained a little bit about Sahaja to him, and then he went upstairs and showed Mother the paintings. The famous Carl Jung used to suggest drawing your dreams, so he had all these rather interesting dreams. I'll leave it at that.

Here's the same puja, and Mother's laughing about something. The pujas were more like fun. I'm not too sure how to describe it. You felt great, and you were being cleared out, and Mother was, most of the time, laughing and talking. Whereas in later years, she appeared to go into a deep meditation.

Anyway, after the experience in 1978, as you know, I started having programs because I wanted to share it with everybody. I was so excited. The early yogis will tell you, you just wanted to jump on the rooftop and say, "Wow, come and experience this!" So I started meetings in Birmingham, which is where I was living, and we built up a very nice collective, starting with meetings in my flat, as I've mentioned before, and then going on to the Friends Meeting House in the city center.

These are some of the yogis from Birmingham and Derby. If anyone doesn't recognize me, that's me. Very different, yes indeed, almost like a boy. This is the first yogi in England.

Interviewer: Is that Tony?

Bala: Yeah, that's young Tony. We were good buddies. Basically, Gregoire, Tony, I, and Jamel were very close. In fact, Gregoire was traveling and didn't quite live in London full-time then, in the seventies. So Tony, Jamel, and I used to call ourselves the three musketeers, because we'd be at meetings, laughing in the back about the strange new people who had come to the meetings. We had a lot of fun, really.

And this person I wanted to point out, this person is Peter Phelps, who was an electrical engineer at Lucas Electronics. This person, in particular, is mentioned in the Guru Puja talk that Mother gave in 1978, where she talks about a person coming from the Birmingham meeting that learned how to surrender. Mother had said we'd be more useful as gurus because we can surrender, and she can't because, obviously, there's nobody to surrender to, to put it in human terms.

So she mentioned this person, called Philip. And Philip had come to the ad that I'd put in early '78, I think it was in April. And he had been seeking for years in India. I think I may have mentioned, Mother made him write down every guru's name, and he had two pages of guru's names which he showed Mother. Of course, he was supposed to burn it. And he came and had a powerful experience. I said, "Park them on a chair," these seven seekers, "and just work on them." Nothing was said. There was a photo on the table, a black and white photo leaning against the wall with a candle. I just asked them to sit down, take their shoes off, and I just worked on their chakras. And he had such a powerful experience. When it was over, he pushed his chair back, and this elderly gentleman, who even then was in his fifties, prostrated completely on the floor before the photograph. Then he jumped up, reached into his pocket, and pulled out a wad of ten-pound notes—and in 1978, ten pounds bought quite a few things—and was offering money. After which, he asked me, "Where is she? I have to go see her." And he went down to London. And that's what Mother mentions in the Guru Puja talk, that he just began absorbing her vibrations, because all those false gurus had damaged him a lot.

Interviewer: So he listened to that talk, that's Guru Puja 1978 in England?

Bala: 1978 in England, yeah. And he had a great... you can see what he's trying to do, right? Making fun. But he was a very joyful, very jovial guy. Lots of fun and nice to be around.

Now, I'm jumping. That was '78. Then in 1979... oh, I should just mention these two. This is Barry. He and his wife, Rachel, stayed in the Derby ashram. He was a physics graduate, and he came to Rolls-Royce to work in my department. He was sitting on a chair across from me, and we used to chat a lot, and I felt, wow, this guy is really one of those real, hardcore seekers. So I used to work on him under the desk. And one day, he said to me, "I'm feeling really weird in my stomach, like I'm all nauseous and feeling sick. And I noticed," he said, "your hands are not on your desk, they're underneath." He called me out. So I then told him what I was doing, and he jumped into it. He jumped into it and he brought his wife, Rachel, into it. So they both got very involved, and they moved into the Derby ashram.

I should tell you one of the consequences of that was her father was one of the directors at Rolls-Royce Aero Engines. And his office was in the mahogany area, which was one floor below us, below the research group, where the walls were all mahogany and these guys were given company Jaguars and things like that. So he noticed his daughter was staying in an ashram, so he obviously decided that needed to be taken care of. And I knew nothing about him knowing or what he had done. But when Mother finally told me to leave Rolls-Royce and go to America, I was called in for an exit interview. And the HR manager goes through the records and he says, "Oh, do you know you are listed as belonging to a cult?" And I said, "What?" Because I didn't mention Sahaj to the people at work, except to young Barry there. So they had all these records, and I later asked my manager to show me some of it, and I was shocked. They had basically investigated the whole thing, probably because I was in the commercial division, so it wasn't too serious. But because they also work on military aircraft, they have to make sure that you're not a security risk. So that's the first time I knew about such things going on. But that didn't stop either of them from being fully involved in Sahaja Yoga.

This was Mother's visit to my house in Tamworth, where I was still doing the Birmingham meetings. And you can see her in our back garden. She's working on the TM people. So this was the TM breakthrough. I'm not sure if I mentioned it in the first video. Mother used to come, she had come before that to Birmingham as well, I just don't have photos of that, in late '78. She came to the meeting in Birmingham, and then we came back to Tamworth and stayed in the house.

At the Birmingham meeting, it was very challenging for the yogis because the TMs, those from Transcendental Meditation, were very caught up. Some were jumping around, some were barking like dogs, some were leaping and screaming. It frightened the regular seekers and it also frightened a lot of the newer Sahaja Yogis who were coming to our meetings. We were completely worn out. It ran late. Mother was working non-stop on them, and right at the end, the guy in charge of the room came and told us, "You've got to leave. You're supposed to have left half an hour ago." So as we were walking out with great relief around 10:30 at night, I thought, wow, I can go back to the house with Mother and clear out. And then suddenly at the door, as we were walking out, Mother turns around and tells all these TM people, "Come to Bala's house." And my heart just fell. And I looked at Tony, and he was horror-struck. We went back to the house, and Mother worked on them till about 3 a.m.

So this is the next day in the garden, and many of them are sitting on the ground. Mother's working on them. And this chap at the back, I'll mention him. He's the one Mother talks about in some of her tapes, that she had a very sick yogi come and stay in her house. And she had told him how to clear out with camphor and different things, and she worked on him every day. He apparently, when she went into the room one day, she found that all the walls and the ceiling were black with carbon from camphor. So this will give whoever listens to that talk a way to connect it a little. This is one of the ladies who stayed in the ashram, Beverly. And these are some of the local yogis from Birmingham as well.

This is my biological mother there, who was staying in Tamworth at the time. I think she'd met Mother the previous year at one of the meetings. She's the one who, when I invited her to the meeting in the early days in '78, the yogis would still sit on the stage. She came and sat down, and I hope no one will feel upset, but she said, "Why do you want to be with all these strange-looking people?" She just couldn't comprehend it. Until she met Mother, of course, which was a completely different change.

This lady on the left is Christine, one of the first six yoginis in England, from London. One of the first hippies that Mother talked about, the really old yogis. So when I came there, I think about seven or eight, including these six, the original core from the mid-seventies, I think '75-'76.

And this is in the house where Mother is working on everyone. This is one of the directors of TM. The way they organized it, they had four directors: one from England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales. And two of the directors came. He didn't last very long. And although Mother was working on them, at times she talked about the seriousness, but she also laughed a lot throughout. You know how Mother was and is.

I actually cooked rice for Mother, by the way. I was going to cook the whole meal, but one of the yoginis who came insisted that she had to do the cooking. I learned to cook from my Malaysian friends once I was in boarding school.

And I'll tell you a little bit about the furniture. I had no furniture. I had come believing that you should not have anything, you should just meditate. So I had a mattress. I did buy a mattress. I kept it downstairs in the morning and sat and meditated on it. Then I carried it to my bedroom upstairs and slept on it. And then Mother said she was going to come to my house, and I was like, what? So I knew I had to buy furniture because she needed that. And then I knew I needed curtains and stuff, which I didn't have. So I was telling my boss, "My mother's coming, I need furniture." So my boss sent his wife—I mean, this is amazing—he sent his wife to measure and get me curtains. Of course, I paid for them, so they helped me with the curtains.

And then the furniture happened in a typical Sahaj way. I was driving one evening with one of the employees at the company, and the car broke down. It was dark already, and someone came by to give us a jump start. And we were saying, "We are on the way to a furniture store." And the person in the other car said, "Oh, you don't want to go there, it's very expensive. Here's a place where brand new furniture that people have ordered but don't like has been returned." So we went there and got a whole set of furniture for Mother. So Mother is sitting on one of those chairs, and I still have two of them. I mean, I couldn't get rid of them. They're completely worn out.

Interviewer: How could you? Yes.

Bala: And they are just... I'm very fond of them, to put it mildly. And even that cloth at the back—we were told Mother liked natural stuff. Someone said, "We need a shawl." These were the days of minimalism. And so I rushed around looking for pure wool, and I struggled and eventually found this pure wool shawl, which I draped on the chair for Mother.

And here is the same Christine you saw in the backyard.

Interviewer: And let me ask you, do you know who this is? Is that Hester?

Bala: That's Hester, young Hester.

Interviewer: She looks so much like Shridevi, her daughter.

Bala: Yes, of course. Hester was a lot of fun, I can tell you that. Very smart lady, good sense of humor, and we had lots of fun.

Interviewer: This is the stay when Shri Mataji stayed in the Derby ashram for a week?

Bala: Well, this is actually my house in Tamworth. She stayed there for a few days, just less than a week.

Interviewer: And tell us about the rice you cooked for her, please. What was the recipe, for example?

Bala: Oh no, I'm too embarrassed. But I learned how to cook from my Malaysian friends. So when I came to boarding school, most of us don't know how to do anything. And my friends from Malaysia just came over and took me under their wing and cooked some food for me, and eventually showed me how to make a few simple dishes.

Mother kept going into deep meditation. This was the following day after the TMs had gone, and she would just go into this deep state of meditation all of a sudden. You'd have no idea what was going on.

Well, I should tell you a funny story. When she was working on the TMs, they stayed overnight. So there were about 32 people crowded in this tiny little house in Tamworth. The next morning, one of them—many of them were possessed, of course, as Mother kept telling us—one of them was sitting on the stairs and sobbing away. And there was this yogini, originally from Greece, who was standing on the steps and doing these hand movements Mother used to use to clear people out, and saying, "In the name of Shri Mataji, I order you to leave this woman!" Ordering the bhoot. And the woman would just cry louder and louder. So my mom, who is here, was in the bedroom upstairs. She came down the stairs and she saw this grown woman sobbing away. And she asks her, "Would you like a cup of tea?" And the woman stopped crying and she said, "Yes, please."

Interviewer: It's a very special photo. I'm glad you're sharing it again. The tender expression on your biological mother's face, the way she's looking at you, and the joy on your face, and how you're all absorbing the vibrations and the pure fun and frolic.

Bala: Yeah, and the magic of what she does. Because this guy whom she's working on, the TM director next to her, you wouldn't have recognized him. If you saw him on a street, you'd cross to the other side before he came to her. And overnight, he's completely changed.

So Mother was working on this, and after that, she would just do namaste to everybody. You can still see my shawl behind her.

The house was up for sale because I was going to move to the Derby ashram to buy it. So here Mother is coming out before going somewhere. And this house was across from a children's playground. And Mother, instead of getting in the car and going on, she walked across to the playground and started talking to these lucky children.

The person who was taking Mother to the station was anxious to get going, and Mother totally ignored him, as she normally did, and was just chatting to the kids and asking them to feel vibrations. You can see the one on the left. Then their moms took them away. In Tamworth in 1978, a tiny little town, we must have been a bit strange, especially when the neighbors saw that there were 30-plus people squeezed in the house. A yogi called Bill Hensel had to sleep in the garage and things like that.

This was Guru Puja, 1980. And in the 70s, some of us got the good fortune to help Mother when she was getting ready for the puja. She was decorating herself. And we were still a small group in 1980.

Interviewer: Is that again another sofa that you then bought for the ashram for Shri Mataji?

Bala: No, this one is now a different location. So this is the farewell to Tamworth. We've left. This is at the Guru Puja at a different location, probably in London. And this is at the end of the puja. Soon after, I stopped taking photos at pujas because a lot of people were rushing in front and clicking. So for some years, she suggested just one person do it, and there was a person who was good at it. A lot of his photographs are in the collective collection.

So I also went with Mother to Toronto. She wanted me to go with her to do some programs. This is now '82, actually. I was talking to the lady in Toronto; she thinks '83. I'm not too sure. I can always check with her. So I'd arrived in the car with Mother, and we're actually talking with the yogis, so I'm holding the mic. I went again in the early 90s, after coming to America, and there were 600 people in the hall in Toronto. Amazing. And Mother decided not to turn up on time, so I got a message to do the program, which was quite interesting. And then much later, after people had been there for about 45 minutes to an hour, Mother came and, of course, again worked on each person individually. She'd sent me to Canada later on, in '85, to start meetings in Montreal. And then after that, I got sent to America.

Here's a Havan in Cheltenham, like a long weekend seminar. We used to rent a lot of nice places, beautiful houses, those grand houses that the wealthy used to have in the old days. You can see some of the yogis. This chap, I think that might be Bill Hansel. He was one of the yogis from England from the early days who, I would say, was very innocent. He was an older gentleman, older than us, very active, very loving. When he first came, a year or two after I'd started meetings, he still remembers. He reminded me, he said, "Bala, you're the first ordinary person we have got in Birmingham," because everybody else had long hair and had been through the mill. And he led a very healthy life.

I have to point this person out because he's not visible in the collective. That is a guy called Paul Winter, whom we have to thank for all the digital videos that we have.

Interviewer: I've heard about him, yes.

Bala: Yeah. Even recently, a yogi was saying he was a difficult guy to get on with, which I do agree with. But he's the one who digitized everything. Because when I first came, I was shocked at how poor the recordings of Mother were. So I bought some equipment, and he digitized everything and got the cameras and whatnot. So most of the good quality videos we see are thanks to his initiation. We all have our role, regardless of the temperaments we may have.

He was quite unorthodox. I thought I was not quite in the mainstream, but he definitely showed me I was okay. He refused to give a flower. We all would give Mother a flower. So what he did was—and he told me this himself, we were very friendly—he gave Mother a little integrated circuit that was encapsulated in plastic, and he offered her that as a gift instead of a flower. And he told me that Mother gave it back to him, and after that, he said he had this idea to start a business related to that. And I believe he was the first millionaire we had in Sahaj.

Interviewer: What did he offer to Shri Mataji? I couldn't quite get that.

Bala: An integrated circuit. It looks like a little black plastic thing with connectors coming off it. From the old days. So he got his ideas from there.

Interviewer: Is that one of the Bevan brothers there? Mark Bevan?

Bala: The Bevan boys. Oh yes, yes. The Bevan lads. The Bevan boys were there.

Interviewer: So then the Brighton collective must have started by then, 1981-82, you would think?

Bala: Yes. Because in '79 we got the TMers, who were, quite a few of them, rather bossy. And then we got the Brighton hippies who came and balanced it out. So we were back to a balanced state again. They came, and they were a breath of fresh air. Lots of fun people came with their love grass in their hand and flowers in their hair and so on.

And this I thought I'd just put in there. That's Mother being the mother. That's her youngest grandchild drinking milk out of a bottle. So she was being a grandma. On the other side of Mother is that baby's older sister, another grandchild. And Mother is working on something at the same time, you know, multitasking, working on some caught-up yogis in front of her as well. It was another time when I was staying with her, so I was able to get the camera out.

These are very rare photographs. I have to say...

Interviewer: Thank you so much for sharing them with us.

Bala: Not at all. I was told there were so many photos out there. I've got hundreds of them. Many are just in boxes, and these were actually in an album which I had just hastily put together. Some of them are not in chronological order. But Rajni, my better half, has promised to help me over the next few months. Now that, thanks to you actually, I went through these albums which had gathered dust.

Interviewer: You're very kind, Uncle. It's thanks to Shri Mataji. But yes, we look forward to having Auntie as well with us at some point.

Bala: Oh yeah. We're definitely going to visit our birthplace, my birthplace, England, which is where the spiritual birth is all that counts. That's it. So really, it just feels like home because all the memories of Mother are there, all the amazing spiritual families.

This is Mother arriving at Derby Ashram for the first time. That's my little Volkswagen Polo, a tiny little thing. Mother is just coming in, and someone took this from the front door. She's just entering Derby Ashram, which had a very long front yard and a very long backyard as well. It had two addresses. The front one was Exeter New Road, Number 79. And at the back was a street called Drury Lane. Later on, many jobless yogis moved in to stay, and they used to use the rear address as their address for the dole, because they couldn't use the front one, as it was registered to an engineer. They thought they might get caught.

So here is inside Derby Ashram, in the front entrance hall. It was an old house, it was listed. It had an old slate roof and flooring, built in the 1800s. It was one of the few we could find that had five bedrooms and several bathrooms, which Mother wanted for an ashram. And Mother is on the phone. Can you guess who Mother is talking to?

Interviewer: Sir CP?

Bala: Yes. And you know, she had to talk to him for ages every day. This is where she decided to stay for a week, because as I mentioned, she came and said, "Oh, this is my home." So from there, we drove Mother everywhere, although the leaders felt that was not good, to drive long distances. And she's sitting there, telling him about where his meals have been put in the fridge. She had to cook for him. They had a maid or a cook as well, but she had to prepare it all, leave it for him so that he would have Mother's hand-touched meals available while she was away on tour. And of course, all other things as well had to be sorted out. Mother spent a good period of time every day talking to Sir CP. I should say, he was very supportive of her work and of Sahaja Yoga. I saw how much he gave in the early days.

And this is upstairs. This is my bedroom. That little thing in the corner is my altar, which I was told off for by one of the older yogis because it wasn't proper and I hadn't cleaned it thoroughly. But when he sat down before it, he did say it had great vibrations, so Mother must have been very forgiving. I didn't know you had to do all this ritualistic stuff with an altar. It was an old cardboard box covered with a nice cloth. Prior to that, it didn't even have that nice cloth. So, confession time.

Mother's lying on the bed, and she's looking at the invitation that we had sent her to come to Birmingham and the surrounding areas. It was sent on a card.

Interviewer: That cardboard box altar takes me back. Way back, actually, when my brother and I lived in Delhi, in Patparganj, Kalash Apartments of all places. And we just moved in, we had a big cardboard box and a very nice, big photo of Shri Mataji that we put on the altar with a very nice fabric.

Bala: It works. You can have it anywhere. I remember one yogi had a secret place in London in the woods where he kept a photograph, candle, and mat hidden in the nook of a tree. It was fantastic. You can do it anywhere, as we all know now.

So this is a bit closer, of Mother looking at the invitation, which had been written on the back of a postcard which had a painting by Blake. I don't know if many people know about some of Blake's paintings, the one about hell and Virgil's travels.

Interviewer: Have you written it down in your diary, that you can share with us, please?

Bala: Yes. It tells you the truth, which is, as you probably know, Blake thought the church was too dominating and didn't allow people to feel the joy, which I'm paraphrasing. And Mother was saying that he's showing hell, but at the same time, that hell is just an illusion. It was used by the churches to control people because of the fear of hell. And I think I mentioned this about the spiritual enlightenment I had in the previous video, and also in the poem by Kabir, that it's just made up stuff, and it's a way to control people. You don't know where you'll go and what there'll be. And a lot of it probably wasn't voiced because it was convenient to keep that illusion going, so that people would behave, at least out of fear, even if not out of an inner transformation. It's like speeding, right? You enjoy driving fast, but the thought of a ticket slows you down.

So here is the invitation, both sides of the card.

Interviewer: Some years ago, quite a few years ago now, we stood outside the Brompton Square house of Shri Mataji, and the vibrations were just so amazing.

Bala: Oh yeah. And bearing in mind so many different people have lived in it.

This is Mother having a morning cup of tea. It was just fun because I was very fortunate to spend a lot of time alone with her.

Interviewer: Tell us some of the conversations.

Bala: So when I was with Mother, all I wanted to know... different people had different things. Some of the yogis would be asking Mother, "What's the fate of the world? Will there be world peace?" and stuff. And I just wanted to know how to get to that state of permanent enlightenment, Nirvana, and never have to return. To just stay in that state which she'd let me experience for a few days. And she'd be going back and forth, talking about the experience, and sometimes, as she talked, I would just become unable to speak or think, as many yogis would probably feel in her presence. She'd also talk about the hard work ahead, and she'd talk a lot about individuals and countries and the situation of Sahaj. She used to say a lot of things about her biological family, about different countries, different leaders, and one just listened and tried not to respond, because you always knew some of it was just testing you to see your reaction.

Interviewer: Also, Shri Mataji could see the events and the future, isn't it?

Bala: Yes. Whatever's unfolding now. Telepathy was very common with Mother. I would know that Mother wanted to see me, and I would be living in Birmingham or Derby, and I would just hop in the car and drive down. I'd just leave work, give whatever excuse, and I'd get down there, and Mother would say, "Oh Bala, you've come. I was waiting for you." So it's just so remarkable how that whole connection is indescribable.

Here's when the collective came in, some of them anyway.

Interviewer: Is that Dania there?

Bala: Yes, that's Dania. She came as a young girl. Her mother, a very nice lady called Magda, came first. She started the Hampstead meetings, and Dania was this sweet young thing. And her brother also came. She used to follow Mother everywhere. She has remained an angel throughout. Many of us have gone through trials and changes and come back again, but she's been steadfast. This is another of the ladies from Derby. Oh, this is Dr. Mathur on the bottom right, just the back of his head. He was the leader of Delhi at the time. At that time, Mother had asked two or three Delhi leaders to come to Derby. She said it was a 'pakka' ashram. "You should see a pakka ashram."

Interviewer: It was quite how Shri Mataji wanted it to be, wasn't it? Like getting up at Brahma Muhurta, 4 a.m. meditation. Could you remind us of that again, please?

Bala: Okay. So she asked me to run the ashram, and for me, it was easy at that time because I was very disciplined. Nowadays, I would struggle. So she said, "Get up at four, do your ablutions, and then you do a full puja in the morning." You wash Mother's feet. We didn't use the elements. We said mantras. She had the leader of India at the time, Rajbhai Modi, type up the mantras, so I had that typewritten sheet and read from it every morning. It lasted a long time, an hour-plus. Every yogi staying there, only about nine or ten, would go and wash Mother's feet. And we were in bliss. I just set a buzzer to come out of it and go to work, because she told us, "You have to work." You could have stayed in that state forever.

And I had to wake them up. So I got up earlier than four and woke everybody up. I would say about half had to be woken up. And I'd go to bed after midnight because I was making the tape copies, so I had to do that after work in the evenings. You came home, and we had another hour of meditation, we had dinner, foot soak. It was constant working, listening to Mother's audio tapes, and each of us took turns cooking once a week. It was a busy time, and somehow, three or four hours of sleep seemed not to be a problem. I didn't even fall asleep at work, which was surprising.

And all these yogis, think of them, we're all in our twenties, including a couple with a young baby. They were just as disciplined. You didn't have to ask them. You think about it, in the last couple of decades, later on in years, Mother had to keep scolding people, "Get up early, meditate, do this, do that. I can't be doing it for you." But it was a very dedicated group.

Dr. Mathur was from Delhi. Mother sent him; well, he came with Mother this time. Prior to that, we had Mr. Dumal, who used to be the leader of Rahuri. He was the one who told me that part of the experience I had during that enlightenment was an experience of the Adi Shakti Herself. And I think Mother had mentioned that to him, because he had come from Mother's house. She told him he had to come to the Derby ashram and stay there for a while. And then the third person who came was another leader of Delhi called Dr. Talwar.

Interviewer: Is that Sanjay Talwar you're talking about?

Bala: Yes, that's his son. Dr. Talwar came with his wife, a very sweet lady, and he stayed in the ashram. And I had to wake him up at 4 a.m. And it was interesting, waking up someone old enough to be your dad, getting him to come and sit down. And he did it. I mean, he was really good. He'd sit through the whole puja. And his wife stayed there, and then later Mother told his daughter and her husband to come as well. It was an interesting time. Mother actually told me, "Try and make him into a Sahaja Yogi." He was still getting into Sahaj and learning about it. He had so many questions; he was still finding out about the divinity of our guru. But he was fully into it, a very sweet man.

One little thing he did do inadvertently was the bed that Mother was sleeping on, we offered it to him. And he was quite a healthy man, and he sat on the edge of it, and the bed collapsed. So it broke. That was the end of that bed, which I had hoped to keep forever after. But they were very sweet, very nice. We had lots of photos of them at the ashram, which of course are not in this presentation. And they were very loving to the yogis, just looking after them. His wife was making drinks and insisting on cooking for them. It was a very loving couple.

Here's the back garden of Derby Ashram. As I said, it was very long, and a lot of the nice flowers you see are not my work. They were Bill Hansel's; he was an avid gardener. He'd come and take care of everything. Mother was interested in everything, all the flowers, all the plants. She was asking a lot of questions. This lady is one of the early yoginis who lived there from Derby, Pat. She still lives near there. And this is Joy. She was also living in the ashram. Oh yes, she had a very interesting sense of humor. One day, when it was her turn to cook, she made a salad. And we ate the salad, and everyone was rushing to get water. And Joy was laughing because she told us she chopped fresh chilies and mixed them in with the salad. I mean, we were all kids, seriously. And she had a beautiful singing voice, she really did. When we sang for Mother before she left for the station, it was amazing.

This is Neil, Beverly's husband. He also lived in the ashram. That's Mother asking me about who was doing the gardening. I think she pretty well knew that I was doing designing with the brain rather than physical work, although now I do love working in the garden.

Interviewer: Why the beard then? Was it saving time or some particular reason?

Bala: Yeah, just, I guess the least I had to do before going to work was the best. Which is why I never cut my hair or shaved when I was in college. It just seemed a waste of time and effort. It was unbalanced. People, especially ladies who saw it, would say, "Oh, one side is longer than the other." And I'd say, "Yeah, I support my hair on one side, and that's why." It had never been trimmed. The only reason I cut my hair the first time, before I met Mother, was I couldn't get a place to rent. I went to a nice neighborhood in London, and they thought I was some hippie.

This is Royal Crown Derby. During the week Mother was in Derby, you may know it's very famous for pottery. The Imari pattern is the one Mother really liked, which is this beautiful pattern. She was shopping, and this is one of the yoginis there and another from Derby. That's Pat there. So she was choosing all this china there. And I know after marriage, Rajni got something similar, only for Mother. We bought it so we could serve Mother on it when she came.

This is another view with some more of the yogis, and that again is the Delhi leader who actually got me into trouble. I should tell you. At the end of Mother's visit, on the last day when she had to leave, we were sitting downstairs, and one of the yogis said that I had composed some songs for Mother. And Mother said, "Oh, sing them to me." I should tell you, I didn't really compose them. It's just that one day, I heard a song on the radio coming back from Rolls-Royce called "Woodstock." I don't know if you've heard that song.

Interviewer: It rings a bell. Please elaborate.

Bala: I think Joni Mitchell sang it originally. And the words just moved me as I was driving home, about the seekers. And so I came back, and I sat on my floor—by the way, I didn't have carpet, so I still remember it was just a wooden floor—and I started strumming my guitar and I sang this song. One of the yogis overheard it when my door was shut and wanted to learn it, and we started practicing. Anyway, we sang this song and a couple of others for Mother. And at the end, Mother said, "The vibrations are so strong, I can't move." And she said, "It's like a puja." So she sat there, and after a while, the people who were supposed to get her to London were getting anxious. So we eventually headed out to the car and got to the station, and Mother had just missed the train.

And my heart just sank. So Dr. Mathur turns and says, "Look at that. First time Mother's missed a train. She missed a train for Bala." And I'm like, it's not for Bala, she was listening to the collective singing a song with all their hearts. And they were beautiful singers; I pointed out two of those who had such wonderful voices. And a thought went through my head, "This is not good. You don't say such a thing in public." Anyway, Mother was laughing and saying, "That's all right, I was meant to spend more time with you." And all the yogis were happy because we got to spend more time. We just stood at the train station, and another train came, and Mother left.

Years later, when I was on an India tour, I had been given a car ride by a very caught-up yogi. I thought, oh, I'll get a ride with him. So I drove all the way, I think it was a couple of hours. It was a long drive, and I was staying with Mother on that tour again. We went to where Mother was staying, and she and Dr. Mathur were in a room. So I walk into the room, and Mother looks up at me and she said, "What happened? You're so caught up. Look at your Agnya." And obviously, I was with this guy who was supposed to be avoided. But wanting a comfy ride, I had gone with him. So she said, "Look in the mirror." So I turned around, so my back is to Mother, and there's this huge mirror on the ground, as this is India. I look in the mirror at my Agnya, then I look at Mother, and Mother is smiling away. And she turns to and nudges Dr. Mathur and smiles and shakes her head at him, like, "Look, I'm making fun of him." And I turned around, and I thought, this is my punishment. I immediately remembered what he said at the train station. And she was showing him that no, nobody is special. Look, he's got his Agnya caught up. But I can tell you, I was devastated because she had never said anything like that before to me. It caused quite a bit of turmoil till the next morning when I woke up and went to her room, and she was like, everything was back to normal. Much relief there. I suppose that was a lesson.

So this is us leaving. That's Gavin, who was the leader of England. That's his daughter, a very sweet girl. This is Patty Pearl, who was David Pearl's wife. Very nice lady. And David Pearl was such a humorous man, lots of jokes all the time.

In my car, as I was driving, she was just laughing and talking to me about things. I didn't take the photo, of course; it was the person sitting behind me.

Interviewer: What was it like driving the Adi Shakti?

Bala: It was... you are already in that state, in that deep bubble. And it's all like a very vivid, deep dream which is intensely joyful. And the source of all that joy and love is manifesting in the human body. It's beyond words.

When Mother first came in '78, I did not own a car. I was taking the bus everywhere. So I had to ask this quality inspector who worked under my engineering department if she would give a ride. I said, "My spiritual teacher is coming. Can you give us a ride?" So she had a Mini, which in 1978 was really mini. And Mother just came and sat in that tiny seat, and I was squished in the back behind Mother. This woman was a chain smoker, and I told her, "You cannot smoke in the car when you're near her." And she had a terrible Vishuddhi. I used to cough whenever I had to go down to the factory and talk to her. So Mother is talking to her, of course, and she asks her to hold out a hand; she had one hand on the steering wheel. And she asked her, "What do you feel?" And this woman said, "I feel a cool wind. It's just blowing into my hand and blowing into my body." And I was thinking, smoker, bad Vishuddhi, and I'm sitting at the back. So she asks Mother, being a quality inspector, she was quite analytical, and she said, "I'm not interested in this. Why am I feeling it?" And very sweetly, Mother said, "Because you're blessed." Simple as that. And she never tried meditation.

A lot of people from the factory came. Some of the ladies in the assembly area, when I used to walk around checking everything was working, one of them, her name is Marge, she said to me, "The ladies wanted me to tell you that when you walk behind us, we feel less stressed about our jobs." And I thought, oh, what's that? I couldn't quite comprehend. So the next time, I thought, it must be vibrations. So I told her, "It's because I meditate." And she started coming for meditation. She told some of the other factory workers. A small group of them started coming to my flat for the meditation sessions in the '78-'79 time period. It's remarkable how Mother was working through us on people who weren't even consciously seeking.

There was one man who was a manager there, one of those public school boys. And he came, and he had such a strong experience. He told me it felt like when he went mountain climbing and got to the peak and sat alone. He used to go alone, and he said suddenly, it was just the awesomeness of nature. He came into this silent state, and it was another world. And he said that's what this meditation in front of a photograph was doing for him. The way it works is just... you have no idea how it works on the most unexpected people.

So this is Mother on the train. I used to try and travel with Mother on the train when she went back.

Now, I'm jumping forward to the India tour of 1982, which was my first one, after a lot of persuasion over many years by Mother. And this is how people were greeted when they arrived. Mother had already prearranged sarees for the ladies and kurtas for the men. And then all the ladies would come and they would choose their sarees, and the men would choose their kurtas. For us, I think it was all white kurtas anyway, which was much easier.

And here is Mother actually buying sarees in India. I was staying with her then. I was lucky, the first tour, because Mother allowed me to stay in her room with her. So every city we went to, I traveled with Mother in her car, and Raul Bai, who was looking after her. And I would then sleep in the same room. So it was Raul Bai, Mother, and me. When Mother was getting ready for bed after all the meetings and programs, Raul Bai would just tell me, "Close your eyes." I'd close my eyes. Then after Mother was changed for bed, Raul Bai would say, "Okay, open your eyes." And I'd open my eyes and then lie down on a little bed in the corner. Then in the morning, when Mother had to change, we'd have tea, and then Mother would say, "Close your eyes," and Mother would get ready for the day. It was just a completely different life. It was so enjoyable.

And we'd go to each center, and then after every program, Mother would come back and say, "Oh, take the vibrations out of me." So we got a chance to be holding the arms or legs of this divine body. And wow, the vibrations. The old yogis from the 70s would have told you, you'd put one hand on Mother's shoulder and then give vibrations to the collective, whether it was at a seminar or an event. And things like that. I remember she'd hold your Vishuddhi finger and stick it on the middle of her forehead, and you'd feel Mother's forehead literally sucking it in, like there was some kind of a hollow pulling it. You could feel it pulling. And then you'd point your other hand at people or at the collective, and you'd feel the vibrations flowing out. It was a completely different time.

And then occasionally, when I'd go from a busy week at Rolls-Royce and go to her and say, "Oh, my head, all this design work," she'd just stick her Agnya finger in the middle of my forehead. And that's it. It was instantaneous.

Interviewer: Do you find yourself tapping into that memory when Mataji would put her Agnya finger on your Agnya, and then you even now feel it's cleared out?

Bala: I do. I mean, if it's not for those memories, I would have probably left this body long ago. It's what keeps me going. Because living in America and putting up with things that go on, it's very difficult when you know absolute reality. And we are not, by the remotest chance, even a minute fraction of the divinity that Mother is. So she could put up with it, although occasionally you've heard her say how it troubled her body. I remember one puja in the 70s at the Temple of All Faiths in London, and suddenly, there were only like a dozen of us there, and Mother suddenly said, "You all should meditate." She said, "It's like scorpions running out of you and biting my feet." Wow. It was something to hear. Because many were still having difficulty clearing out a lot of catches and doing the discipline.

This is the dreaded buses you traveled in on the India tours. They would say, "Get in the bus at 5 a.m.," and at 6:30 a.m., nothing had moved. They were either looking for the driver or for the attendant or something. But that first year was fine because I was in Mother's car. The second year tour, half of it was with Mother, and suddenly, I had to grow up. And she said, "You should now go and enjoy the collective." Another story. I had to go enjoy them, and that was also a different type of enjoyment. And I got to know many of the foreign yogis better when you're out there with the collective.

Here's one of the pujas. This year, '82, I was with Mother, so I'd arrive at the puja location with her. And often, the Indian yogis had it pretty much ready, but Mother had to wait for the Western yogis who were traveling by bus. And as I said, the buses were always late. Sometimes they'd break down. Drivers were not yogis, so they would stop for something or the other. Mother would be waiting for an hour, which was good for me because I could sit and meditate and watch Mother.

I took this while Mother was waiting. You can see the towel on her. They first wash Mother's feet, and then the puja process would begin when she wore her puja sari. And Mother said, when I showed it to her later after it was developed, she said, "This has captured my innocence." And I gave it to people who felt they had difficulty clearing a particular chakra, or if they just wanted the feeling of this. Because there was no puja yet, the group hadn't come, and she was just sitting there gazing. And I went in front of her and took this photo.

And this was after the puja at that same time.

And then, this is Singapore. When Mother found out I was born in Singapore, she said, "We should start Sahaja Yoga there." So she first tried to have meetings prior to this program through a person who worked in the shipping corporation. In Singapore, there was a law that said gurus are not allowed because they'd seen what a lot of fake gurus were doing in the West. So in the early 80s, gurus were banned. It had to be done under the radar, so to speak. She was able to do a program privately at some location this shipping corporation guy put together. But this year, we were able to get the Ganesha temple on a street called Ceylon Road. My ancestors, if you go back four or five generations, come from Ceylon. They have a history of about 3,000 years there.

So Mother wanted to come and have a program. My father used to be one of the trustees, I guess, at that time in the community, so we were able to get this temple which he was involved with, and they allowed us to do a program there. Mother did a public program, interestingly, in a Ganesha temple established in Singapore. And then the meetings used to be held in our house with my brother and my mom. Then a yogi from America went there for work and continued it. This was after my biological mother had met Shri Mataji in Tamworth.

This is at the airport with my mom and brother on one of those first trips when she was leaving Singapore airport. And she looks rather pensive there.

So now we have switched back to England. We also helped to set up Malaysia, which also became a good center. It was a bit difficult because it's officially a Muslim country, so we had to tread a little carefully. This one is Diwali puja, again at the Temple of All Faiths, that old place with the cement floor. I think by this time, they had put down rugs and carpets.

This is all the collective at a big seminar in Zermatt in '84, with the mountains in the background. And that's Mother and me at Zermatt. We had some very interesting times. We were staying in the adjoining room across from Mother's room, that's me, Gregoire, and I think another one or two yogis. And in the morning, early morning, I heard Mother calling aloud, "Come, come, come!" And we were still in our pajama bottoms and sleeveless t-shirts, and Gregoire said, "Oh, I've got to get dressed." So I just ran into Mother's room, and Mother said, "Come, look at the sunrise." And she showed me out of her huge picture window, and the sun was just rising, and the top of the Matterhorn was covered in this beautiful golden-red hue. Amazing.

That, of course, is the young Gregoire. We were very close in those days, had some good times together. Mother would make fun of us because she'd say, "Look at these two intellectuals." And you know in Sahaja Yoga, that's not a word of praise. But we enjoyed each other's company.

This particular one, she was laughing at some of the things that some of the Western yogis had done. You may have heard it in talks where some ladies from America were told not to bring too much luggage. I only carried a small bag for my tour. And you get there and you see yogis from America coming with massive, heavy suitcases. And someone just reported to Mother that one lady had brought her curling irons with her. I mean, I didn't even know such things existed, by the way. No one in my family had used them. And of course, the complaint was it did not work on the Indian voltage. You can think about going from the sublime to the mundane.

Interviewer: Gosh, yes. Amazing. But it was a lot of it is joy and Mother's humor that I think kept many, many people in Sahaja Yoga. Amazing stories and the photos that you've shared this evening, uncle. Thank you so much.

Bala: Well, thank you so much for getting me to pull these out. Seriously, many of them were dusty. In fact, Rajni had to go with a feather duster and clean out the box before I opened it in case I started sneezing. Some of us are a little sensitive to 30 or 40-year-old dust.

Interviewer: And what treasure.

Bala: In fact, my older daughter said that we have to digitize all of this so that the collective can have it. The ones that have Mother in different situations, I think is... there's already a huge collection, and I never thought of it because there were so many photos, but maybe there were some here that show Mother in different situations and different aspects that would be nice if the collective wanted some of them.

Interviewer: Oh, that would be awesome. I think it would definitely be very, very good, not just for the present, but for the future generations as well. So very apt suggestion from Priya, if I may say so. But yeah, thank you, uncle. We will conclude this session for now and regroup.

Bala: Okay. Thank you so much.

Interviewer: Thank you. And thank you for these beautiful memories. Talk to you soon. Thank you. Bye-bye.
