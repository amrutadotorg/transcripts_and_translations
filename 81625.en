 (England)
One in Rome school and one in Dharamsala. What I remember about the Rome school was quite funny. I came to breakfast late, and there was an American yogi there, and she goes, "Ah, you can't sit there. That's Guido's seat." I just laughed and said, "Okay," and moved.

And then I went to Dharamsala from Rome. To this day, that has been my best meditation ever in my Sahaja Yoga life, up at Dharamsala. And I really feel Shri Mataji was just preparing me for here. Because when I was there, I said, "I could do this for two or three months." And right now, our terms are three months long.

How I came here is quite a story also. The couple that were here before couldn't stay for some reason, and I remember being really upset—disturbed, more than upset—that the school wouldn't continue running. My husband was already here. He came in October of 2004 to be the caretaker of the land. I knew I was coming, but I had a job working on an organic farm. I said, "I'll come in the spring. She'll be able to find help in the spring. I'll wait till then." We had quit our jobs in June of 2004, went to Guru Puja, and then moved to Maine. So I'm in Maine, and my husband's in Canajoharie.

I knew I’d come to Canajoharie, and I didn't sleep well that night. So I got up in the morning wondering, "What's up?" because I really didn't sleep well. When I'm upset, I like to talk to Shri Mataji out loud. It was just me in Maine alone; the yogi I was living with was on holiday. I just prayed, "Shri Mataji, we really need the school to keep going. We really need to establish the Ganesha Tattva in the Americas. Please help us to continue this school, to grow and be an instrument for you."

So then I was very nice. I sat and had my silent meditation, and after that, I felt so peaceful. I was just like, "Okay, I feel peace now." I got up, finished, and was walking into the kitchen to make my breakfast when the leader at the time, Manoj Kumar, called. He said, "Oh, so what are your plans?" I said, "Well, I'm going to move to Canajoharie, but we need to get a job. We didn't retire; we quit. We have bills." So he goes, "Oh, yeah, so you're going to come to Canajoharie?" I said, "Yeah, in the spring." He goes, "Well, how would you like to be the head dorm auntie?"

And I was just like, ugh. I said, "Um, can I get back to you?" And then, of course, I said yes, because I just saw that as where Shri Mataji was leading me. I remember telling my kids that I was very nervous, that I didn't know everything in Sahaj. My kids laughed at me and said, "Ah, but that's what a mantra book's for."

By Shri Mataji's blessing, every term, from the very beginning, she has always sent yogis that have helped me learn things that I didn't know. Part of my speech when staff comes is I say, "We all learn from each other. I know you're here to teach me a lot of things, as I hope that I'm able to teach you a lot of things." So this school's been running now, like I said, since September of 2004.

Maybe that's partly why Shri Mataji guided me here. I remember I was in the Jersey ashram helping prepare her breakfast while she was staying there. I was very excited to help, and I had made cantaloupe and blueberries—I love blueberries. We sent this in with other things on her tray. And when her tray came back to the kitchen, she had eaten all the cantaloupe, but all the blueberries were still there. The yogi who was the main cook at that time said, "Shri Mataji said, 'Blueberries are for little girls.'" I was disappointed, but then again, it was prasad. I just felt like it was another way of her saying it's okay to be young at heart, simple. I'm a very simple person.

One other story that I didn't hear personally, but a yogi had told us, is that when they decided to put a school in her home here in Canajoharie, Manoj called her and asked for the blessing to use her home. She said yes, obviously. But she said, "Once you start, you can't stop." And the yogi who told me the story said she called back two or three hours later and said this again: "Once you start, you can't stop."

How do I interpret that? It's just important that we keep working on this Ganesha Tattva of the Americas here and establish that blessing on this land that she also found for us in the early nineties. And keep that going.

I don't know what else to say. I've been here so long that things are so routine. I can tell you that it was tough closing for COVID. Since then, we haven't really gotten back into full swing. We used to have 15 kids; we're at 12. We're always trying to look for staff. It's really nice, different than all the other schools because we are so small. I remember we had an auntie two terms ago, and she said, "I like this family feeling." And that's really what you have; you're just living with a large family and working it out. Here, you're together 24/7. The town is at least 15 or 20 minutes by car. It'd be nice if anybody had any questions. I'd love to answer questions. Yeah, go ahead, if anybody has any questions.

"Has there been anything, Teresa, that you would class as a miracle while you've been at the school?"

I can think of some for myself. The one thing is that I have always felt guided my whole life, since I was little. And I feel that Shri Mataji still does that here. Like, my first term here, I let the kids play outside by themselves, because that's what we did with our own children. And I remember being in the kitchen, which is in the front of the house where the kids should not be. And I remember hearing "Shri Mataji." And then looking up, and there are two kids up front who shouldn't be out front.

I don't know if that's a miracle, but I have many stories like that. What I've seen here for me is how well the power of your attention really works. With the children, with adults, if you put your attention on something in a surrendered way, things just work out. I remember one lady was here, and I thought, "I should really talk to her about that." And I just put my attention on it and then let it go. And the next day, she's doing what I had put my attention on for her to do. I've seen that also with the kids. But I can't really think of what I would consider a miracle.

I think it's been a blessing to be here. I've grown so much. My first term, I remember wondering why I was here and what boon I had asked for to be here. I really feel blessed to be able to grow as a yogi around children, because they're unconditional love. That's it. I remember another time I was in my room, and I was upset. I came out, and a little girl just walked up to me and said, "Auntie, I love you." And when you have something like that happen, you have no problems, none at all. I think this school in America is really important in establishing the Ganesha Tattva tradition. And that's what she said when she bought the land. She said, "This land is now to help America establish the Ganesha Tattva."

"I find it so beautiful, Teresa, the sincerity and the simplicity of your surrender. I feel is the miracle for me. That you're just so... I think it's so normal for you to be in this beautiful atmosphere of love and in the vibrations that you don't even realize that just you saying, 'I feel surrendered'... I find this is a miracle in and of itself to have that kind of a constant feeling, because I can speak only for myself that I get that just from time to time. You are living that all the time. And it's just very nice to hear."

Yeah, I have been through a lot of challenges where I've doubted that sometimes. But recently, I pulled a Leela card, and it said, "Everything is taken care of, but believe that everything is taken care of." It was Shri Mataji at the Chelsom Road Ashram in 1981, New Year's Eve. And I've been reading that almost every day because I've been through a lot of different trials and tribulations here too. But really, once you can get through it... I have my moments of being detached and not being detached. I feel that yogis that have come through here have helped me through this all also. People say, "Oh, you've done so much there." I say, "But I don't do it alone. I have Shri Mataji, and then I have all the yogis that she sends here to help." I think that's the most important thing. Having that faith, really having that faith in Shri Mataji, it's just a huge blessing that I've worked through here, I fully believe.

"Teresa, how many people from how many countries have come to help at the school? And isn't it a miracle every time that you get enough staff?"

Gosh, I've never counted the adults. People from all over have been here. Yes. When I first came, we used to have more people, and we used to have to actually pick. And now it's gotten where... and I think this is a phenomenon happening at all the schools, not just here... it always works out in the end, always, getting the staff. But yeah, we've had people from Russia, Ukraine, Estonia, Lithuania, Brazil, Colombia, Italy, England, France. It's a little easier now. In the beginning, getting people from Brazil and Colombia was very difficult. Visa difficulties. Back in the day, it was very hard. Now it's India, actually.

"Somebody just asked, what is the age of the kids here?"

They're pre-K, kindergarten, and first grade. So it's four, five, and six. When I was first here, we kept going up in grades because kids didn't want to stop coming. But then we had a huge waitlist, so then we cut back the grade to first grade. It's a nice transition. We just had a boy here last term, and now he's going to Dharamsala from here. It's the same ages as the Rome ashram used to be, and Borotin also.

"Any plans to make more grades later?"

Yes. We've been trying to expand for a very long time. It's a maya, a big maya. But yes, we were hoping to go up to fifth grade. I think it was Robert Hunter who said that would be good, because then it would complement Cabella, and it would also complement the Devi School, because Devi School starts at sixth grade.

"What's stopping the expansion?"

That's a good question. I really don't know. We change our Vishwa Nirmala Dharma council every two years, so when you get new people in, then you have to start fresh again sometimes. The people who have been there for a while will say, "We want to review it again." And by the time they review it—we're all volunteers—it takes a while for them to get going. So I don't know. People could say it's not the collective will, but I think it's maybe the maturity of our collective.

If we can give bandhans, something needs to work out because I feel this Ganesha Tattva... it's getting tough, not just in America. I don't know how it is in other countries, but the Ganesha Tattva and all this LGBTQ stuff... it's tough to watch. Janaki Shete, she's a first-grade teacher, and she's had to see it out there in her classroom too. First grade is usually age six. And she lives in a very liberal state, in a city area. Many years ago, she said this happened—it had to be 10 years ago. You're not even allowed to hug the kids. You can't call them a boy or a girl; you have to call them "them." So it started a while ago. It's just progressively gotten more acceptable, which then influences the public schools. There's a strong need for Ganesha Tattva.

"Do you have to be assessed by the local authority?"

No, in a sense, because we're already established. They all know we're here; it's a very small town. They know we run a school. We do get the Department of Health. They're the ones who inspect our kitchen and make sure that we're doing everything sanitizing and preparing food properly. They come every term and inspect us. But that's the only authority-type thing. We do have to do water samples, and we have informed the local school district and the local fire department that we're here, but that's pretty much it on an authority level.

"Did you still need volunteers for this coming session?"

No, right now we're pretty good. We possibly may need one more, but right now we're ready to go. The kids come back on March 23rd. We'll run to June 8th. I think we cut it by one week so we didn't get too close to Adi Shakti Puja.

It is our desire to have it here on the land, but some people have other ideas of possibly buying a building somewhere else. Let's see what gets worked out. I'm going to be 62 this year, so I've told our school board, "Listen, I would like to be Auntie Carolyn." Auntie Carolyn came here for many years and was like the grandma and helped out. I think that's a big responsibility. Now, let's see how Shri Mataji works that out. I think, like Mary Coon always says up at Devi School, it's nice to have that change because you don't know what the next person will bring.

I remember telling Florina Wallenberger when I came—because I thought this was going to be a temporary position—I told her, "As soon as you find somebody that's more suitable or more qualified, just let me know. I'll step aside, no problem." But here I am, 19 years later. So I guess that person hasn't come forward yet. But like I said, I feel I've learned so much by being here and growing and just being me. It's been nice. I've met a lot of beautiful people coming through here.

"What's the proportion of Indian children to white Americans?"

It's pretty high, more Indian. But I consider them American too because they've been born here. But yeah, it's definitely more Indian kids than white kids.

"Are children of new yogis coming to the school as well?"

Not yet. We have an auntie who's coming from Vancouver, her name is Emily. She's only been in Sahaj for like five years, and this is her third time coming to help us. She has a daughter that's three and a half, so maybe she would be one of the first ones. I think it's more adults whose kids are grown or too old for Canajoharie.

"And you haven't quite been there long enough yet to get the children of children that have been through the school?"

I did have the second one. It was really fun last term. We had a young girl who was here, she's 19. She was a student, and just by coincidence, her dorm auntie was also an auntie last term. So that was fun to see. It was interesting to have the student and her dorm auntie both here, but now her student is taking care of kids also. She has such fond memories of here when she was a student.

"There's another message: just big thanks for all the years and all the love that you've given to our kids there."

Thank you. It's been, like I said, my blessing. It's one thing that I usually do before we even start looking for staff. I ask in one of my meditations if she still wants me to be here. And so far, I keep getting yes. When I get the call, then that'll be my time. But it's my true desire, if it's meant to be and if we do get somebody else, that I'd like to at least teach them what I know. A lot of it is a living experience, and you're going to have to live and learn on your own like I did. But some of the simple stuff, of mostly helping a person with like, when kids get sick, what do you do, and how to just navigate certain things that I've learned. I would feel really privileged if I was able to do that.
