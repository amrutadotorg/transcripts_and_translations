Talk to Sahaja Yogis
Madras (India)
Talk Language: English | Transcript (English) – VERIFIED

I’m so very happy that there are so many people that are interested in Sahaja Yoga in Madras. I’ve been coming here quite often and I felt that if people from Madras once understand Sahaja Yoga, they will realise that all these years whatever they have been seeking, whatever they have been doing, in the name of God, in the name of religion, now is the time for them to get the results. The people in Madras, I know, are very religious. But they are religious in a way that’s just, as Adi Shankaracharya has said it, “Chapta jalam”. That we are lost in ‘chapta jalam’: we say mantras, we read books, there are Shaivites and also there are people who are Vaishnavities. All these things to us have been important also, because we thought by following these methods, we will achieve our ‘moksha,’ we’ll achieve our last goal.
This way I must say that Indians are very alert and they are basically spiritually minded. They also know what is wrong and what is good. They also know what is dharma, what is not dharma. They may do wrong things. They may take to things which are absolutely against their spiritual life. But in their heart of hearts, they all know that this is wrong. But they can’t help it.

Now we have to understand that we are specially blessed. We are specially blessed [aside: Then it’s all right] We are specially blessed by people [aside: Let her right] who were our forefathers, we can say, who were our people in this ancient country, who were great seers, great saints and incarnations, and who have given so much time for the emancipation of our spiritual life. To them, material life was not so important. Specially in the South, I feel that people are deeply rooted into dharma.

I read about Shalivahana who met once Christ, one of the Shalivahanas in Kashmir. And Christ told him that, "I come from the country of ‘Mlecchas’, ‘mlec’, ‘mala-iccha’. The ‘ichha’ is [Cut in the video and audios. Following come from Divine Cool Breeze: desire for filth. Their desire is towards (matter) not towards purity. And I have come here because you people are absolutely ‘nirmal’, pure. Shalivahan told him, "Why do you want to come here. You should go and work for those people who are malekshas". We are different type of people even today Even in this ghor kali Yuga, at least 70 percent people believe in God, have faith and fear of God. All this that we have is nothing but a kind of awe. A fear of the unknown. We don’t know that God almighty is the ocean of compassion and love.]

... Now we are as human beings. We have to achieve a state to know Him. We don’t know God. We don’t know ourselves. First, we have to know ourselves. Once we know ourselves, then only we will know God.
I have seen ritualistic behaviour in the South very much, especially in Madras when I came first time. I was surprised how people were doing everything with their heart, but they did not know why they were doing it. They had such bhakti, but such a blind bhakti, that it will lead them nowhere! I used to think that, "When will I be able to tell them to be beyond this?" You have to have ‘shraddha’ and ‘shraddha’ is enlightened bhakti. Unless and until you have your enlightenment, the bhakti has no meaning. Like this, [mike], if it is not connected to the mains, it has no meaning. Unless and until you connect it to this All-pervading Power of Divine love, which we call as Brahma Chaitanya, our bhakti has no meaning because there is no connection, like telephoning to someone without the connection. So, simple thing is: this connection, this Yoga, has to take place.

[Cut in the video and audios. Following come from Divine Cool Breeze: You might have read lots of books or may know so many things like Vedas. So what? It’s like you have a headache and the doctor suggests a medicine. He writes the name of the medicine.] ... not going, is to reading that name of the medicine. You are not taking the medicine, just reading the name of the medicine. This is the medicine I have to take. This is the medicine I have to take. When are you going to take it? And unless and until you take that medicine, you are not going to achieve, by any chance, whatever is promised to you. Because it is such a deep ignorance about all these ideas we have learnt, and that has penetrated into us. Such a lot of ignorance! That ignorance, really, is like a ditch of no return.

I have seen people, they have books after books. There are people who will do, I don’t know, one lakh of mantras, Shiva’s mantras. Somebody will do this. Somebody will do that. Then [unclear] then fasting, this, that, and reach nowhere. They are the most hot-tempered people, or they have no joy in their heart. They leave their families, come out of it, and they think that they have done a great sacrifice. God does not want all this non-sense. He doesn’t want. Why will God, who is your father, who is so compassionate and loving personality, supposing you call Him that way, then why will a father want you to suffer? And all kinds of funny ideas of suffering have penetrated within us.

We can always say about the people who are, say, Muslims, or even the Christians, they believe in all kinds of penances. From where these ideas are coming to their heads? That also I don’t know. Because why should you suffer? By suffering, how will you gain 'moksha'? It's beyond Me.

If you take it the other way round, as Kabira has said it that, "By starving, if you are going to achieve your moksha, then already there are many people who are starving in this country. So they will all get their mokshas". He says, "By shaving your head, if you are going to get moksha, then the sheep which is shaved every year should be there before you are there". They all have made fun of you. They have all said all kinds of things for you to know that all these outside things are of no help. Of course, you do it genuinely. You are attempting everything genuinely, because you want to have your liberation, your enlightenment. But as a Mother, I tell you, you don’t have to do all this, please don’t do it.

Firstly, if you want to upset your mother, you always say, "I will not have any food". Finished! The mother is finished after this. So why do you want to punish your Mother by fasting? There is no need. So, so much importance is given to food! Then do all types of things, you get up at 4 o’clock in the morning, and go on chanting something, and the whole house is up. Somebody might have slept at one o’clock, two o’clock, you are doing your ‘chandan’, this, that, and making noise. And everybody is fast asleep, disturbing everybody.
[Shri Mataji is laughing gently]

Then also the food part: you won’t eat this, you will eat that, this, that. Once we had a lady, a friend, she’s supposed to be, who was a vegetarian. So she said, "I’m coming to your house for 15 days and I will stay with you. but I will not eat my food cooked in your utensils. You’ll have to get new utensils". So we got the new utensils. So, she said that, "The cook has to be a Brahmin". So, I got one Brahmin for her. We all stopped eating, because, you see, with all these things, we were going to hotels and eat there. This lady was the only person.
[Shri Mataji is laughing gently]
Then she said, "No, this, I do not take this water, which has come from the tap, I’ll take it from the well". So, the well was in a far-fetched place. Every day the driver used to go and get the water. Then she said, "No, it should be brought while you are completely drenched", we call it ‘oleti’, completely drenched. "The driver has to be all right, but this cook has to be completely drenched with water". Then we said, "All right, baba. This lady is staying here for 15 days. Let us manage".

So, we sent the cook, who was completely drenched, who had to take water with a drenched body. And within 3 days he got pneumonia, and fourth day he died. I said, "Now what is this? This lady is going to kill how many Brahmins here?" [Hindi] on my head But she could never understand! She said, "I do the same when I am there". I said, "Baba, maybe there are facilities. You have facilities, you should do". Like that she was torturing us for 15 days. My children went to one of my friend’s house. They were staying there. From there, they were going to college and come back. This lady would get up at 4 o’clock. I don’t know what sort of things she used to do. She had brought all her deities, everything. And she said, "I have to do pujas of God, these things". And- but she had no Realisation. Ultimately, she died of cancer.

Now I told her that, "I can treat you". She said, "No, I cannot take water from your hand". "All right, now you don't take water from my hand. So how will you take it? " She said, "No, at the most, you can blow into it, but you don't touch it with your hand. If you touch it with your hand, I'll not have." So, I didn’t know how to vibrate it also, so to begin [with]. And I could not give her Realisation. I could not cure her of cancer, nothing. But she was so busy with all this orthodoxy. so stupidly busy, that my husband said, "I am going out to the station now if this lady is going to stay." Now only myself and husband were left. Everybody left, you see, my children were staying with somebody. We said, "We don’t know how we spent these 15 days with this great lady". And ultimately, she died of cancer.

Her children were also, poor things, they came to my house. They said, "Could we touch this? Could we touch that? Could we touch the water?" I said, "Were you mad? What is this?" All the time asking, "Should we go into the kitchen? Should we?" and should we go into the kitchen? The children were really mad, and the way they were tortured, they couldn’t even study or do anything. All the time busy, "Should we touch this or not? Should we sit on this or not? " With all these restrictions what did she achieve?
[About the mike: You’d better take it out... cut in the video]
And there was no joy. No joy in her life, no joy in the life of the children. She never made anyone happy. And I was very sorry for her that doing all this, in the name of God, where is she?

So, this kind of ritualism is also very much in the South. While in the North, they are absolutely- they don't know anything. They don't know who was Dattatreya. But Ganesha, they know a little bit: I mean, here and there. They don't know Kartikeya at all. They don't know who was Kartikeya they don’t know. If you say Murugesana, they'll say, "Who is this Murugesan?" They would not know. Quite abandoned! But I was surprised when I started Sahaja Yoga, it spread like fire. It spread like fire. With all this knowledge it would not work out in Madras or in Bangalore and I don’t know about Travancore; that's another mad place, where they bury their own forefathers in their own houses.

Then when I went, we had another type of people, intellectuals and communists. And they wrote against Me saying that this lady- I was invited by the MIDC, these people, the tourist people had invited Me. And in their hotel, I was addressing them. So they said, "There is a carpet, wall-to-wall carpet". And, it was not mine by any chance. They said, "She was sitting in a sofa". That was not mine either. All kinds of things they said about Me were so stupid! I said, "What superficial intellectuals these are! I am going to tell them about something so deep, and they are just judging Me on this kind of things".
So, they lack- superficiality completely kills them- they lack complete understanding about spirituality. "It was a beautiful carpet. This was very nicely done. And she was wearing a watch". I mean, after all, I’m a married woman. They expect Me to dress up like a sanyasi baba. I know. Otherwise, for intellectuals, I am zero.

So on one side are the intellectuals of the South who expect every woman who thinks she has something to do with spirituality should not wear any ornaments. I mean, I am a married woman. She should not even wear a Mangalsutra. She should have no relationship with her husband. All kinds of absurd things they have made out of a lady who has to do something in Sahaja Yoga, or you can call it spirituality. The other side are ritualistic.

I know Sahaja Yogis will be the ones who are in the center. They have to be in the center. And these Sahaja Yogis can see clearly that what is needed to achieve your Realization is pure desire. Not all this nonsense. Neither this way, nor that way. Pure desire achieves your Realization.

Maharashtra is another gone case now because suddenly, they have started drinking a lot. That during the reign of Indira Gandhi, they were given lots of alcohol free, I think. So now they are only drinking. We had three public meetings in Pune, and I had seen the way they drink in front of Ganesha, and do all kinds of dirty things, and use very abusive language. Their women also drink, and they dance to disco and all kinds of things. I have seen it. I was so shocked. So I told them, "See, you are doing this in the presence of Shri Ganesha." For fourteen days they do that. "But do you know that this deity is such a powerful deity? [Hindi] And if you go on like this, it will definitely create problems for you, and then you will be ‘bhookampa’ means earthquakes." I told them. In three public meetings, it is on my tape. And a fourth time, this ‘bhookampa’. Whether you believe it or not, if you do all kinds of nonsensical things like this, in these modern times, it will have an effect.

Apart from that, the other influences are of a-gurus. Madras is full of them. Everybody seems to be some sort of a guru slave. Very bad. But worse than you is Calcutta. Everybody is ‘dhikhit’. "Dhikhit!" [Shame on you!] Somebody sitting in the corner, there’s a guru there, "Dhikhit!" and Tantrikas, very much more in Calcutta, of course here also you have. When you have these bad gurus, they create such negativity that you cannot prosper. The Laxmi Tattva goes out. And because of that, the poverty will never go away unless and until you get rid of all these horrible gurus. We have everywhere, I shouldn't say only in Madras, or only in the South, or only in Calcutta. We have them everywhere. But here, I think the people are too simple, and hero-worshippers.

The other day, we were in Bangor, and there is some birthday of some cinema actor. Thousands of them were sitting on the- standing on the road, sitting somewhere. I said, "What’s the matter?" "You know, today is the birthday of such and such artist, cinema artist, and so they are garlanding this figure of that man". Garlanding him, so many were there to see! I mean, I said, "This is ,nowhere in the world will people do like that". This is idiotic! It’s absolutely idiotic. Ah! You can say Americans and equally the same. Because like that lady, Elizabeth Taylor, she got married 8th time, I think, 9th time. Imagine! We’ll not even see such an inauspicious face. There were 4-5000 people, when she was going for her honeymoon, 5000 people were there and to see her off. And she had married some carpenter or somebody much lower than her and much younger than her. To see her, there were at least 4000 people. Can you imagine? And then on top of that, there were these helicopters hovering, who were dropping people with their cameras, you see, to take a photograph. This is only possible in America, even this will not be possible in Madras or even in Bangalore, I tell you. Even if you drop off someone who is a cinema actor.

This, I can’t understand. If somebody acts like a cinema actor, say, he acts like Shri Rama, he becomes Shri Rama even. [Shri Mataji laughs gently] What is happening to the intelligence of people? He may drink, he may smoke, he may have ten wives, doesn’t matter. He acted as Shri Rama and Shri Rama is to be worshipped. Even in the picture or in all the cinemas, start doing. This is going too far with your simplicity. And it’s not only villagers who do it, but there were all kinds of people standing.

I was once in Coimbatore and the same fellow’s car passed through. I was standing on the street. So, they took the dust of the street, where the marks of the tires were there, of this gentleman’s car, and put it on their heads. I was just wandering [Shri Mataji laughs gently] "What is this idiocy? My God!" And continuous, it was. Very seriously, you know they did. Very seriously. They’ll shave their hair, go near a temple, somebody will pour water on a woman, she’s, poor thing, rolling around. Very seriously. I feel like crying really. How can they torture a woman like this? All kinds of stupid things we do, and in the temple, in the name of God.
I think it’s the same as the Muslims are having Jihad, we are having Jihad against ourselves. They are having against others. We are killing ourselves, "Don’t eat food, do this, do that". All the time after our lives! "Are Baba, this God has created this world for your comfort, for your enjoyment". Why did he create this world if you had to go through such Hell? That is Sahaja Yoga.

In Sahaja Yoga, you know your identity, you understand. You understand how glorious you are. Once you are connected to the mains, you know what powers you have, how beautiful you are within, and you start respecting yourself. You don’t have ego, but you have a right idea about yourself.

I’m so happy, I see so many people here from Madras, who are willing to take to Self and who are in Sahaja Yoga. Of course, it cures people, no doubt. It has cured many people. Apart from that, it also gives you mental peace, complete peace. Emotionally, you become a very balanced person. But above all, you get the powers to give Realization to others. First, you get your Nirvichara samadhi. And then you get your Nirvikalpa samadhi. This, you all get it, as soon as you are connected to the mains. It’s a very, very remarkable thing.

In Bangalore, I met a Sahaja Yogi there. He told Me he is doing some sort of a tissue culture. And normally, out of a thousand, only about 12 people, 12 to 15 people get all right. I mean, the tissue culture is where they try to create many plants out of, say, one seed or one stem or something. "But I am a Sahaja Yogi, and I just stand here and give vibrations. They pass through the vibe waters, and my success is 100% ".
He is a farmer he does not know even English. But he says, "Mother, with such knowledge within myself, I can feed it". So, this is what one has to know that whatever you are not today, you will be by this evening. You have to become the Spirit.

This is very important to understand that we are not ordinary human beings. First of all, you have come to this programme because you are seekers. You are special human beings. Then you get your Realization. You get all your powers. You need not be a P.H.D., MHD, anything like that. You need not be a big successful person. Especially, I’ve seen, those who think they have been successful never get Realization, normally [unsure]. Because they are lost, to normal common sense, they are lost. So they don’t get it. Like bureaucrats, very difficult! Ministers, it’s impossible. So how do they get it? How do they get it, they get it when they have from inside, innately, this desire to achieve it.

Just to feel that way. It is a such a remarkable thing that everything is tangible. Even the small children can tell you what’s wrong with you, which chakra is bad, even small children. They close their eyes, they will also tell you It’s such a great discovery which we don’t realize, may be because we have no sense of our spiritualities. But when I went to Russia, the oldest University which is called as, in Leningrad, the university is called as the St. Petersburg University, the oldest university. They gave Me a big award that they made Me one of the ten members of the University, who were, sort of, who were given a higher, or we can say the top most awards. I said, "I was one of the ten, so far. The oldest university, I was one of the ten who got this award". So I looked at it and I said, "What’s this? I’m just a housewife. I’m not a scientist, nothing. How are they giving it to Me?". And one of them is Einstein, the ten. I said, "How can you give it to Me when you have given it to Einstein?" What they said, "Einstein, what has he done? He has just managed the material side and he has worked on matter. You have worked on human beings".

So, things are going to work out. And that is why I say that you should all move out from all this kind of darkness, and get into the light. And see for yourself what you are. First of all, to be born in this country means you have really something special. Such a blessing it is, you have no idea. This Mother Earth, nowhere you will find such a Mother Earth, in the whole world. But you have to have your Realisation. Otherwise, you cannot value it. It is so great and that is why I want you to understand that, even if you get your Realisation today or tomorrow, or anywhere you get your Realisation, try to understand that you are exceptionally something achieved in life, which you could not have. It’s tangible, you can find out on your fingertips about anyone, about yourself, about your chakras and the chakras of others.

So such a big gift is there now, and I would request that you should utilize this gift by gifting it to others who have not received it. That’s the greatest thing you will do and you will be joining into a very, very big, global group, which is the living organism of Sahaja Yoga. All over the world, you will have friends. All over the World they will know you.
There is so much I can say about Sahaja Yoga. But in this short time, whatever was possible, I have tried to bring to your notice, what Sahaja Yoga can do for you. Only thing is that you should attend our programmes which they have for you, very important. Without that, you will never grow. Like if a nail is cut, don’t grow. It has to be grown with the help of the body.

In the same way, you have to belong, or you can say, you have to be a member, whichever you want to say. You have to be there, otherwise, you’ll not grow. As you know, we have no membership, we have no hierarchy, we have no priest, nothing. We don’t believe in that, because you all have become your own masters.

Now as you are here in Sahaja Yoga, you have to understand that all your customs, all your affiliations, anything, is respected. Nobody will say, "Don’t do this. Don’t do that". But you yourself will know what is not to be done, what is to be done. You become your own master. You become your own guru. Nobody needs to tell you anything, because there is light in your attention.
May God bless you all.

Sahaja Yogi: Some of you are new, I am sure there are certain questions which you would like to ask. And here is an opportunity if you would like to ask any questions to Shri Mataji, you are not going to get many opportunities like this. So let us, in an orderly fashion, if any of you want to ask any questions on Sahaja Yoga, please stand up and ask the question. I am sure Shri Mataji will enlighten us.

Sahaja Yogini: [Inaudible]
Sahaja Yogi: Louder, louder.
Shri Mataji: Everybody should hear you.
Sahaja Yogini: Shri Mataji, I have some earnest desire to spread Sahaja Yoga, but my family problems come and I want to know where I am [unclear].
Sahaja Yogi: She wants to spread Sahaja Yoga but she has family problems which prevent her from working on something.
Shri Mataji: We also have ways and methods how to solve family problems, all right? So you can do that first. And you can solve the family problems, you see. What is the family problem you have?
Sahaja Yogini: [Inaudible]
Sahaja Yogi: No time. She is working and has come back after work to look after her household. That doesn't leave her much time. Is that what you are saying?
Shri Mataji: It's all right. Just desire it and it will spread. It will work out. If you have desired it, it will work out. Through meditation, you can serve yourself very nicely.
