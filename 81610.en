Interviewer: Hello Joan, nice to see you this morning.

Joan: Lovely to see you too.

Interviewer: Great. So we're meeting here to talk about Shri Mataji's visit to Sheffield. You are in Sheffield and have been there for quite some time—very nice too, very welcoming whenever yogis come in. Would you like to tell us about how you got your realisation? Where did you learn about Shri Mataji, and what was it like for you?

Joan: Well, I actually came in June 1982, after I'd just passed my driving test. I came along to keep my sister company; she was really interested in this, and I just liked the word "yoga." What it meant, I thought it would probably be a keep-fit type of thing. But obviously, something inside me knew that it wasn't because I came in a very nice dress with my makeup on and my high heels. Looking back, that was really an incredible experience. But at the time, it was very gentle.

We had this nice public programme and we listened to a talk by Shri Mataji. I found it a little difficult at first with the photograph, just because of my upbringing. But when I closed my eyes, I could actually see Shri Mataji with my eyes closed. I felt very comforted and very happy. So we sat there for a little while, listened to a talk, and then we had a workshop.

That was really quite interesting because I was sat next to my sister and she was feeling all these amazing things. I was actually having the idea that, "Oh, it'll not happen to me because I'm not good enough for it to happen to me." Then, somebody was stood behind me and I just began to feel more and more relaxed and more comfortable. Suddenly, I realised I was in this place where I thought, "Oh, this is me. Oh, I quite like me," which was an absolute revelation. If you're always being judged and told you're this or you're that, you're never actually allowed to just be yourself. I was feeling so nice, and I could feel this fragrance of roses, which was beautiful, absolutely beautiful.

Then a lady tapped me on the shoulder, asking me how I felt. I just wanted to be there; I didn't want to talk or engage with anything else, just enjoy being in this place. I explained that I could smell all these roses, and she told me it must be a rose on the table, which was quite a long way away. In England, roses just don't smell like that. So I knew that wasn't it. Looking back, it was the moment that completely changed my life, but I didn't know it at the time.

That was in 1982. Then in 1984 was the first time I went to see Shri Mataji, which was in Hampstead Town Hall. It was a really, really big event. The Hampstead programme was actually a series of four talks that Shri Mataji was giving. This was a really big deal for me, and I enjoyed it so much, seeing Shri Mataji for the first time in this very grand place. That's the place you want to see the Goddess, with all the chandeliers and everything. It was also amazing seeing people there that I already knew from Sheffield, who had left Sheffield.

When we got back to Sheffield a few days later, Ray Harris came up to see his family and we were having a programme—we used to have one every Thursday at their house. He said, "Shri Mataji would like to come and do a public programme in Sheffield." And it was to be in either two or three weeks. We went to London on the 2nd of July, I believe, and Shri Mataji came around the 22nd. So we had this excitement of trying to get ready for this really big event.

As any organiser knows, it's not so easy to get a hall in such a short space of time, but we managed to get one. We got the Library Theatre in Sheffield, which is right next door to the Lyceum, the big, well-known theatre.

The time came when Shri Mataji was coming, and she was going to stay at the Harris's house. I was delegated to pick her up from the station, so this was a really big event. When I got to the station, I was on my own, driving there in our Volvo estate car. I had no idea how many people were actually coming, but it was lucky we had this car. As I was waiting outside, I'd been there a while, and it's a place where you can't just sit. You have to go and park the car after a while. Dr. Warren, who was travelling with Shri Mataji, came out and said to me, "You can go and park the car. Shri Mataji will be some time. Mother will walk to the car." I went, "Oh, okay." This surprised me. I don't know why; I couldn't understand why I didn't think Shri Mataji just walked around. But anyway, that's what it was.

He said, "Shri Mataji is having her photograph taken. She's going to get a family railcard so that her grandchildren can travel cheaply." Dr. Warren had mentioned to her that she should get one. As we found out later, Shri Mataji actually went in the photo booth to have a photograph taken and combed her hair, which apparently is something really special. Then, of course, she went and had the railcard made. This was a way you could travel with your family, and your children got to travel on the train for just a pound each. Shri Mataji was travelling with Pat, Dr. Warren, and two of Shri Mataji's grandchildren, Anand and one of the girls.

They came and got in the car, which was interesting. Apparently, in the back of the estate car, there were some seats that came up that the children could sit in. So there was Pat and Shri Mataji in the back, Dr. Warren sitting beside me, and the children in the pull-out seats. We were driving across town to Mrs. Harris's house, and I was very nervous. Although I could drive, I'd not been doing it all that long, and we had Shri Mataji in the car. I always remember my driving instructor telling me, "You have to drive as though you've got a duchess in the back." I thought, "Well, I'm doing much better than that!" So I got us to the house and parked outside. We were getting everything out—the children, the luggage, and what have you.

Then Shri Mataji was asking for her makeup bag. Well, this totally floored me. It was like, "God has makeup?" Oh gosh, it just really blew me away, a bit like the fact that Shri Mataji could walk. You just don't expect that; you imagine elephants and carriers and things like this.

Shri Mataji came in, and I found myself in the room with her. I'm not sure if anyone else was there. Shri Mataji sat down and she was just so lovely, talking to me like I was an equal. She said I looked nice and asked if I made my dress. I knew not to answer that. She was sitting there, just relaxing, and I just bowed at her feet. It was the most extraordinary experience. I could feel all this power emanating from her. I wasn't sensitive—I didn't really feel vibrations on my hands or anything—but I could feel it. As my head was on the floor and my hands were towards her feet, it was like there was a magnet pulling all this stuff out of me. It was unbelievable. It sort of reminded me of comics where you see things happening and they show you lines of force—it was just like that.

After a short time, Shri Mataji said, "God bless you." I looked up and I was looking at her face and into her eyes. It was like you were just falling in. Again, it was like stuff being drawn out of you. You can't even describe that experience, being face to face with the Goddess. You totally feel that you're not worthy, but you're raised to this place where you feel, "Oh yes, I'm supposed to be here."

Then, tea was being brought, Shri Mataji was being looked after, and people were coming and going. Of course, we had jobs to do and things to get ready for the public programme, like flowers to collect. I was with Ilana, and we were a little bit worried about Mrs. Harris. She was doing the cooking but she'd not been well. We had to go a long way to get the flowers. Ilana wanted to turn back, thinking her mum didn't have enough help, but we had to carry on and get them to the venue.

Later on, when we came back, I went with John Glover and took Shri Mataji to BBC Radio Sheffield for a radio interview. He told me later that while they were sitting there waiting for the interview, Shri Mataji got her perfume and was spraying it across her forehead. He said it was the most amazing thing because it all ran into her Agnya chakra, into the bindi. So that was quite a remarkable thing to hear. I just sat waiting in the car, and then Shri Mataji and John came back. In the car, Shri Mataji said, "Oh, we've not given them an address for people to contact."

Interviewer: Sorry, just one question. Do you remember the date? I know you mentioned it's '84.

Joan: It's 1984. It's somewhere between the 20th and the 24th of July, I think.

Interviewer: Brilliant. Thank you. Okay, go on, sorry.

Joan: It was not long after I'd actually seen Shri Mataji in London, and it gave me the feeling that, "You've come to me, so I will come to you." It was just amazing. I can't even believe it's true now; it's a bit like a dream because it's fantastic to believe this experience really happened.

Anyway, she sent John back into the radio station with my address. Then she was talking to me, asking about my husband; he wasn't in Sahaja Yoga yet. So I was a little concerned about my address being given out on Radio Sheffield before I'd mentioned it to him. But she was asking me questions about my life and things like that. Then we went back to the Harris's. I think I had to go off and do something, but then I was sitting there when it was time to go to the programme. Paul Winter was there with his baby, Akash, I believe. He was describing to Shri Mataji about fax machines, where you can send written things through the phone. That was quite a historic thing when you think that was just the time they were coming out.

I was getting a bit fidgety, and Shri Mataji looked straight at me. She said, "Is it time to go?" "Yes, Mother, it's time to go." Paul Winter said, "Shall I take you?" And she said, "No, she'll take me." So we went outside. I think I was a bit worried about Mother coming down the steps and into the car. Paul was parked behind me, so he got in his car. Off we went to the programme. At the Library Theatre, you could then actually drive right up to the doorway, because it's in a pedestrianised area.

The programme happened there, which was really lovely. There were an awful lot of yogis there because they would always travel. There were one or two little incidents. We'd mentioned it to a reporter and got him there, but he was quite rude. He was taking Mother's photograph as she was speaking. Then, people went to Shri Mataji at the end of the programme. It was a lovely programme. I think it's at this one that Shri Mataji talks about the "she-feel," because we were a lot of women.

Interviewer: Yes, I tried to find that public programme on the website, but it's not there.

Joan: It's difficult, isn't it? I got a copy afterwards from Ian Paradine in Switzerland. They did video it, but it was very bad quality.

Interviewer: Even if the audio is there, it's probably worth putting up, but never mind. Sorry, carry on.

Joan: It should be there in audio; it was on cassette. So then a family came. Dr. Geeta was there; she lived in Worksop. This family came with a quite disabled child. They went to Shri Mataji and obviously thought she could heal the child. Shri Mataji asked about the child's date of birth and she pointed out that the mother must have been out in an eclipse. This is where we got the notion that pregnant ladies should not go out during an eclipse. The family was then referred to Dr. Geeta, and that caused quite a stir with her.

After that, we all went back to the Harris's house and had a really lovely meal. It was quite a small room, so we had to pass the food along. Shri Mataji got her food, but for everyone else, we just had to pass it along. During this time, of course, we were running out of milk for the cups of tea, so Ilana and I went off to get some. By the time we got back, all the food was gone. But anyway, it was enough that we were there and shared this time with Shri Mataji. It was just so lovely. I wish I could remember some of the things because Shri Mataji would always talk to you about various things that came up and what was happening around.

Shri Mataji had arrived on the train, and I believe she went back in her car. Her Mercedes arrived quite early the next day. I did mention that Mrs. Harris had not been feeling so well. She was in her bedroom, and Mother passed by, going to the bathroom. She would call Mrs. Harris "Harris." And she said, "Harris, what is the matter?" Mrs. Harris was saying it was her foot; she'd had a problem. Mother put her foot on Mrs. Harris's foot. I tell you, after that weekend, she was very okay on her feet. So that was really lovely. I didn't see them much the next day. That was the visit to Sheffield. So spontaneous.

Interviewer: That's amazing. At this point, may I just mention that you had been a very successful businesswoman at this point in time when you met Shri Mataji, wasn't it? And there's this whole story of transformation, the journey to joy for you with your realisation. How was that, Joan? A family, a career, and then this?

Joan: The thing was that when I came for realisation, we were running a business. I had children who were about nine and five. Our business was doing the electrics on cars, and we also had a shop. Really, we were just like hamsters, just busy, busy, busy all the time. I was always feeling quite stressed. I had asthma and permanent headaches. No matter what you were doing, you always had to be somewhere else. I had also just gotten glasses, and at that time, glasses were very expensive.

The thing was, I got my realisation and then I started the meditation. I didn't need the glasses. I didn't need them for 12 years. You couldn't even explain how this could happen. One of the first things that happened was that in our big house, I found I couldn't shout for my children. And as I got quieter, so did they. That whole relationship completely transformed. I could fit everything into the day. No matter what I was asked to do, I managed to do it.

Interviewer: Amazing.

Joan: It didn't matter what it was. I would always be ready with everything to get to the meeting place for the programme on a Monday night. We used to make the big chart, the altar, and get the cups and everything for tea. It was just amazing. You could do all this and be free.

The complete transformation in me was that I could do everything, I could do it with a good heart, and I could be more open with people. So that meant everything improved. The business improved, the relations with the customers were good. Because we worked on the same property, our house and the garage were in the same place. And the kids... I really enjoyed my children after that. My second one, he was born realised, which I understood after I got my realisation. So I was able to deal with things like when they get overheated and a bit excited, and know what it was that was troubling him. That transformation really changed my life. I immediately stopped having asthma. And the headaches... after that, if I got a headache, it was like, "Why have I got a headache?" So I was very, very lucky. I got used to feeling well all the time and being able to cope with whatever came.

Interviewer: This was when the pandemic came and everyone was talking about the "new normal," it just came to one's attention how we kind of have this life which feels to us like normal. We just take it for granted that things are just sort of flowing, they're working out, and there are these blessings of Shri Mataji just because we have the inner enlightenment, the Kundalini, and our connection with Shri Mataji, isn't it? So, do you remember any humorous incident with Shri Mataji where you had a good laugh with her?

Joan: Not so much in the 1984 programme. I was so out of my depth. I couldn't actually believe that I was with Shri Mataji, and it wasn't for very long. All the yogis were eating with Mother in that room, and it was very quick because it was from one afternoon to the next. The time just flew.

Interviewer: Would you like to share with us the program of 1984, the public program? You told us about the venue and the people and that your address was given out on the radio. What happened? Did people come and sort of throng?

Joan: It's very hard to look back at that time. The theatre was tiered; you came in the door and went down steps. It seemed really quite full to me. Shri Mataji went up onto the stage. It was a really lovely talk, but I don't remember an awful lot of it because I was busy thinking about how I had to drive them back in one piece.

As the talk was going on, all the yogis were just feeling amazing with their vibrations flowing. I had to go out a bit early to get to the car, because I think maybe Dr. Warren was helping Shri Mataji come back. So it's a bit of a blur, that bit, the actual programme. I'm sure there are a lot of older yogis who were actually there and can remember. It was like getting to the car; I maybe had to move it a little bit and bring it back to the door for Shri Mataji to get in. But then of course, Bala jumped in the front, and Pat and Mother were in the back. Her granddaughter must have gone in the back as well, but Dr. Warren got in the back in the children's seat with Anand. The car was full again.

It was just so joyful. Shri Mataji was talking, remarking about things, and everybody was talking. But all I can remember is that I was so concentrated on the driving to get everybody back safely. It fills your head. You just make sure you don't hit anything. It's surreal. You cannot believe that this is what you're doing. Everything seems to flow in a different dimension. Shri Mataji takes you to a place where you do everything. You ask the question, you're there, you're talking like you never would believe you could talk to somebody of Shri Mataji's stature. This big voice comes out, you make yourself clear, and you can answer.

Then of course, we got back to the house. Shri Mataji was sitting in the corner, and there were people literally everywhere. You couldn't get in there to give people food; it just had to be passed along. And then immediately, something else was needed, so I was off out in the car again. So although I had times with Shri Mataji, I was often leaving to do other things. The things that stick with you more are when you're physically doing things; that stays in your memory a bit more than what Shri Mataji was saying. I've listened to the talk many, many times. You would think I could remember a bit more about it, wouldn't you?

Interviewer: Oh well, we're toddlers, isn't it? Toddlers' awareness, that's what it is. Could you tell us about the first puja with Shri Mataji, the one that you can remember?

Joan: The first puja I went to... so I first saw Shri Mataji at the public programme in July, and it was the following April before I actually went to a puja where she was present. It was so memorable, obviously, my first puja. It was in Birmingham at Birmingham Polytechnic. The public programme was the night before in the centre of Birmingham, and we only arrived in time to see Shri Mataji leaving. It was really lovely; the first thing we do when we get into Birmingham is see Shri Mataji.

Then we heard from the yogis that Shri Mataji had said a lot about St. Paul and St. Peter in her talk. She was really giving it left and right about the church.

The next day was Saturday, and in the morning, Shri Mataji was giving us a talk. She asked the leader, it was Gavin then, "What should I talk about?" Gavin said, "Could you talk about Maha Maya, Mother?" So she looked at him, "Oh, you're English, so clever." Shri Mataji was talking about Maha Maya, and there was so much in this talk. I believe it was on this day that it actually snowed.

In the evening, we were getting ready for the puja. I managed to get a sari, which was really nice; I already had one as a gift. We got into our saris and were ready to go. Shri Mataji came and said, "We can't have the puja now because the sari's not arrived. And according to the organizers, we cannot have the puja without the sari." Then she was talking to us for a little while and said, "As you can see, I didn't get ready for the puja. I knew what was coming. Generally, I have to look after myself, but now I can see you all looking so nice in your saris." She was enjoying that. It was a very strong talk Mother gave us, especially about children and the Muladhara. She was working something quite big out in the Muladhara chakra. I do remember she was meditating with us and she asked Djamel to go and put his hand on her back Agnya. It was a very strong and deep talk.

The next day was going to be the day of the puja, and of course, everybody had to be out of their rooms by a certain time. When Shri Mataji arrived for the puja, she was on time, but only about a third of the yogis were there. This was quite shocking. "Where is everybody?" The message came that everybody, including the mothers and babies, had to get out of their rooms before 12 o'clock. This was why people weren't there; they were trying to get ready and pack their stuff all at the same time. This happened on the 23rd of April, Easter Sunday, which was also St. George's Day.

It was awesome. Awesome is the only word I can use. I just remember that she was concerned that there was a big red sheep or something behind her. It was absolutely stunning. I don't have words to describe that feeling, that you were at something momentous. It completely took your breath away. You're almost thinking, "How am I here?" It's like you've gone up to the heavens. It just didn't seem real, so far removed from normal life. Again, I don't remember the talk, and I must have listened to it so many times. But it was just completely awesome.

A lot was going on even after the puja. There were some gifts sent from Australia—pictures that were handed out. I think the gift from Birmingham was a framed photograph for each center of just one of Shri Mataji's feet. I remember I had to go up and collect it from Shri Mataji. She was looking at me and telling me that I looked nice in my sari. She handed this beautiful picture to me. It was so amazing. I just think back now and I'm absolutely stunned. I'm more stunned now that it happened than I was when I was there.

Then Shri Mataji was telling us to ask her questions. "Ask me the questions that people ask you." I was a bit timid, but I thought, "I will ask this question because I need this answer." My question was, "Shri Mataji, how can we convince people that this is genuine, this is real?" She explained that until they do it... She used the analogy of how you can pick up what you think is a rope, but when you look, you can see it's a snake and you will put it down. I think she also described the elephant, about various blind people feeling an elephant and describing what it was, and it all sounded different to everybody. She also spoke about artists and colors and said, "They have to try it. They have to experience it."

That's what I remembered from there. It was the most joyful thing I'd ever been to in my life. It was my first opportunity to be making those connections with other yogis. Apart from that, Shri Mataji was arranging to do lots of public programs throughout England. She was picking the dates and getting everybody to commit to what they could come to. So much happened in that one weekend.

Interviewer: The other puja would have been the Adi Shakti puja, if it happened then, and the Guru puja?

Joan: It was the Guru Puja. I don't believe at that time we had an Adi Shakti puja. Pujas came more later on.

Interviewer: Please tell us about the Guru Puja.

Joan: The Guru Puja was in France, in Paris, I think. This was the first time I was going abroad, the first time I'd ever been on a plane—though we may have gone on a coach, we did a lot of coaches then. I remember it so well because it was also the first time I met Shaila, at this puja.

We got to Paris and it was chaos. We were trying to register, but nothing seemed to be happening. It seemed to take all day to get us in. Apparently, we were in a place where every false guru was staying. There was a lot of confusion. They eventually got us booked in. We put our stuff down and then we were going to a lecture; we just went where we were told. But apparently, at this time, it was quite shocking to find that people hadn't been sent to welcome Shri Mataji. We realized later that Shri Mataji hadn't been met at the airport. We didn't know Shri Mataji was at the airport; the yogis were asked to go into a hall for a meeting. We were just herded into this hall and somebody was talking, and we had no idea that Shri Mataji was arriving around that time. The import of that didn't hit us until later when Shri Mataji did actually arrive. We were lining up on the roads as she was being driven into the place we were staying. At that moment, we had no idea of the seriousness of what was going on.

Later in the evening, Shri Mataji came to talk to us and she was very angry. She was saying that all the deities were really angry. She said, "You've come all this way for me, and you're treating me like this." It was quite shocking. Looking back, it was the time where the awe had to be brought in about who Shri Mataji was, how we were supposed to behave, and what we had got. For myself, I didn't fully understand what it was, this having self-realisation.

Apparently, Shri Mataji was going to leave straight away. She wasn't going to stay; she said there wasn't going to be a puja, that all the deities were very upset and didn't want this to happen, that we didn't deserve it. She said we had to take it to heart, we had to show that we realised this was not okay. She said that we should all stay absolutely silent, not talk at all to each other. We should be silent for 24 hours.

We left that first program quite subdued. We just went about getting things done and really going inside, thinking, "Oh gosh, how could we treat Shri Mataji like this?" We were really introspecting and absorbing the fact that this was the most momentous event ever, that Shri Mataji was here in person and we were allowed to be there. It was really hard and very shocking. Of course, I'd never been in a different country, and this was only the second puja I'd ever been to.

So we had this time of reflection for 24 hours. No talking to anyone. You just went inside and wanted to absorb and look at yourself and think, "What is in me that I did not recognize the importance of why I'm here?" How could we have offended Shri Mataji? It's easy to say the organizers didn't do this or that, but we were being shown it's our own personal desire to treat Shri Mataji with the protocol that is required.

I don't think until the last minute did we think the puja was going to happen. The next day, we quietly went off to bed and were very quiet the next morning during meditation. Then we got the message that we were going to be lucky enough, in spite of what had happened, that there could be this puja.

We got ready and went there. This was Shri Mataji like I'd never seen her. It was the full majesty of all the deities being present and of who she was. We were sat there very quietly. She was saying that she could only have this puja by agreeing with the deities that only those who wanted to go to greet her could come forward to do the puja. All the leaders had to go back and sit at the back. In that way, the puja took place. It was just stunning that we were actually allowed to be there.

Later, after the puja, Shri Mataji came and was talking to us. I think there were some bhajans being sung, and they were singing the song, "She's got the whole world in her hands." People were coming up with different lines, and then somebody said, "She's got forgiveness in her hands." And that seemed to break it. Suddenly, she was saying, "Oh, my children, you know what to say." Then our Mother was back.

Interviewer: Oh, what a relief that must have been.

Joan: It was! That tension, that serious, deep gravity... you didn't feel joyful, that I can recall. But after Shri Mataji talked to us, it seemed to be all right. The musicians were singing, the bhajans were happening, and then I think it was at the end of the puja that Shri Mataji took her leave. She was in her car, and this was in a big marquee or a hall. We went outside and there was a field. Shri Mataji was in the car, the window was down, and she was waving. The car drove round and round this field, just round and round.

Interviewer: Amazing, like putting us in bandhan.

Joan: Yes, it was a special blessing. Complete blessings. It was almost like you've been so far down, but suddenly you were so high up. It was like Shri Mataji had raised us all. We had to be at this pinnacle where we knew who she was and what our job was.

Interviewer: My God, that must have been a puja and more. Just listening to it is awesome and awe-inspiring in itself. And yet that relief and the joy of pleasing Shri Mataji, our Mother... wow, amazing. After this, what happened? When did she come back to Sheffield? And tell us something about the gifts and presents that you would have given or received as well, please.

Joan: Okay, but I should mention that we really got over it at the next puja, Shri Ganesha puja in Brighton.

Interviewer: Oh yes, please do.

Joan: So, we'd had this very awesome experience, and then the next puja was in Brighton. It was lovely because every single yogi was at the train station with a flower in their hand to greet Shri Mataji. She was so pleased. It was just so lovely. Mother was back. You felt so much more love because it felt like we'd been forgiven and we were on to the next thing.

Interviewer: That too must have been the place where the couplet, "Mataji, Mataji, your face shines like..."

Joan: Yes! As you can imagine, it's a public place, people are trying to get on trains, and there's just a corridor of yogis. Mother came through and she took the flower of every single person. She came out and stood at the car. You can see on the video, Mother's coming out and she's laughing, she's got flowers in her hand, Greg is at the side, and she's just so happy. Then she stands in front of the door of the Mercedes and all the yogis have come around the car, totally surrounding it. This is where Greg starts that couplet. Then you can see Mother and her face changing because she's just so pleased. It's almost like, "Yes, these are my children." It's like when your children have been really naughty and then they do something so sweet you can't believe it. It was like that. You could see her tears and she was laughing, and she was so beautiful to see, this change in her face. It is stunning, absolutely stunning.

Interviewer: This reminds me of how Shri Mataji, I mean she is the Adi Shakti and the Maha Maya, and how in her physical being, when she was doing all these programs with such a hectic schedule—two days here, three days there, flying or driving—and yet not getting tired and nothing showing on her skin. Was there some experience you had where you could sort of see the difference between her as this total divinity incarnate and the human element?

Joan: Well, yes, because when you were before her, she would talk to you as an equal, like family. There's the maya you have to watch. The contrast between the Guru Puja and the majesty of the Shri Ganesha puja, which was so incredibly loving... just recently I had a look at Shri Mataji's itinerary and literally every day she was in a different country, practically. It was phenomenal, but we didn't see that in her face. She often said, didn't she, "I'm running a marathon, you're only in a relay race." Whoever came before her, they got her full attention for a moment, which was about as much as you could bear. She never showed how hard she was traveling. We used to have a magazine, and on the back, it would list all the places she was going. And she went to those places. It was like, gosh, giving public programs... but she never looked tired. How hard she worked for all of us, and still works for us. I mean, how grateful can we be? In 1985, there were so many public programs just in the UK: Bath, Bristol, Sheffield, Birmingham, so many. And she was also going to different countries.

Interviewer: Tell us about some presents that you would have given to Shri Mataji and presents that she would have given, or some mementos that remind you of those occasions.

Joan: Well, not long after the Shri Ganesha Puja, I got a message from Gavin, the leader, to say to invite Shri Mataji for a public program in Sheffield quite soon. I got somebody, Tim, who was staying in Sheffield, to write this very nice invitation because he's an artist and I thought it would be beautiful. I got a message back that said, "You have to write the invitation." So, I wrote the invitation and got the reply that yes, she would come. It would be a public program in Sheffield, but I was told it was going to be a seminar, and my job was to organize the public program.

We were told what present to get for Shri Mataji for the seminar. I delegated this to this lovely guy Tim, who was part Spanish and part English. Off he went to order the gift, which was to be a "King's set"—it has two forks and a spoon. You'll notice this spoon is a bit discolored because this is real silver, and this is not. Also, it wasn't made in Sheffield; it was made in Birmingham.

So it came as a surprise on the morning of the seminar to be told that Shri Mataji had changed her mind about the present and she would like a tea set. We had a couple of hours while Shri Mataji was talking to the yogis to go out and find a tea set. I didn't think this would be a problem. This is Sheffield; this is where we make silver and steel. Apparently, it's not that easy. In August or September, it's seasonal. I don't know what they do, make it and put it on a shelf until they decide to sell it.

So we were going off to find this tea set. We had to go to the center of town; we were on the outskirts at the Sheffield Polytechnic where the seminar was happening. We went to the Sheffield shop where they sell all the goods made in Sheffield, and they said they were very sorry, they hadn't got a tea set. "They're seasonal, they don't happen this time of year." We were in an alleyway trying the vibrations, trying to figure out where to go next. We went to Cole Brothers, which most people know as John Lewis. We walked into the crockery department, and there was a tea set on sale. We were just so grateful there was a tea set.

We went to buy it. We explained it was a gift. They said, "Okay, we'll polish it for you." If it's a gift, they said, "We will wrap it for you if you go and get yourself a card and some wrapping paper." So, bear in mind we've only got a couple of hours to do this. They polished it, they put it in a beautiful box, they wrapped it. I wrote on the card, "To our Holy Mother with all our love, with all our hearts, with all our souls, and with all our minds," which is from the Bible. We just made it to the end of the seminar.

I arrived with this yogi, Gareth. We got back in time, gave him the present to pass on, and I went and stood at the back. Shri Mataji opened the box and she was absolutely delighted with it. She was looking at it quite seriously, and then she looked at Fran and said, "Did you go for this?" He went, "No Mother, Gareth and Joan went." So she really smiled. She was looking at it, and there's a pattern on it, a square-shaped pattern. She was describing that this was a famous pattern in India and how beautiful it was, and how she and C.P. would actually use this for their morning or afternoon tea. That was very beautiful. It turned out that Gareth had actually worked for a little while in the place where it was made. So we knew Shri Mataji was really pleased with this present.

When I reflected afterwards, I wondered why we had to change the present. I didn't even realize the first one wasn't fully silver, but also that we had sent somebody from Sheffield to get it and he had to go outside Sheffield. He didn't know it wasn't made in Sheffield. It was all these little coincidences. I was thinking it probably just didn't follow the right line for a Sheffield seminar. As it turned out, the present worked out really well.

The public program happened, I think, on a Friday. Shri Mataji arrived by train again, this time with Djamel. While they were coming on the train, I think it was Warren who drove her Mercedes to the station to pick her up. My car then was a little Mini, a change from the big estate. We had just moved house, so it wasn't possible to invite her to my house. I was told to book a hotel. We picked the St. George Hotel at Nether Edge, which was part of the Swallow Hotel group, but we know it as the Kenwood Hotel. It seemed to be quite an auspicious place; we felt the vibrations in there. Some yogis had been in to clean the room and make it nice. We didn't know Shri Mataji was bringing her niece, because she traveled with Djamel and I think maybe her niece as well.

They went to the hotel and Mother had a little rest before the public program. We had managed to book a hall in the City Hall, which is quite resplendent. I had tried to get the poshest hall we have, which is called the Cutlers' Hall, but it was slightly out of our price range at £345. I was feeling a bit of a fraud, this housewife trying to book a venue. They said, "We are cleaning our masterpieces, there will be scaffolding, we can't book it anyway." After a chat with another yogi, we decided to go for the City Hall, the Memorial Hall, which is really quite a lovely, grand hall.

That's where the public program was. We'd been dashing about, the girls had made the stage so beautiful, the flowers were amazing. There were quite a few people there, but there were also some really strange people. We got this guru-type person who brought his three followers; he was all dressed up. It just made me cross.

Some nice, interesting questions were being asked. Mother was talking and asking for questions from the audience, and you can hear Gavin shouting out, "Can we have the realisation? We are hungry!" Shri Mataji was laughing and saying that if we get to the end of the questions, other people here really want their realisation. Bill Hansell had introduced Mother, which was really lovely because he's quite humorous, and he did the usual description of the chakra chart.

There was a chap who was really insistent, asking Shri Mataji if she wanted to go to heaven or hell when she died. Because he kept asking, she said, "I'm already in heaven. I'm always there. Get your realisation and come and join me." He was one of the chaps who did actually turn up at the next meeting.

There was one lady who was very distraught. Mother had explained about different things, and I think somebody had already asked about drugs. This girl said she'd been taking drugs for a very long time and found it hard to get off them. She asked, "Would I get self-realisation?" She was very distressed. Mother was just like, "You are going to be all right. You'll be all right. Come to me, come tomorrow morning to the hotel." She really soothed her down, and I think she did get her realisation.

What was interesting about that program is at the end, she actually told us not to give them anything—no photographs, no literature, nothing. On the way out, she was talking to everybody who was there. There was somebody who had been to some false gurus, and he was telling Shri Mataji about it, that he couldn't feel anything on his head. Shri Mataji was feeling his head and she just looked at me and said, "Tell him about the lemons and chillies."

Then, as we got outside, I was being asked to go in the Mercedes, but I was muttering to myself, "I can't believe these Sheffield people are so rude." She said, "It's all right, it's okay," immediately calming me down. I just wanted it to be so perfect.

Interviewer: What did you tell them about the lemon and chillies treatment? How did you explain it?

Joan: Well, they came to the local program and then we were able to tell them about it. I have to tell you, at that time I wasn't clear because it was written on a piece of paper and there was something about a bowl of water that I've never seen since. But what we would do is get the seven lemons and seven chillies and some natural material to put them in. We'd cut the stalk end of the lemon just to the white pith. We'd get the seven chillies and pop it all in a bag or a bowl you could put by your bed, but also a bag that you could take it away in that would disintegrate.

You would leave it in front of Shri Mataji's photograph to vibrate for as long as you could, overnight would be good. At that time, we weren't saying mantras, so we would just tell them to give it a bandhan. Then, wrap the bag up and put it by their bedside, by the side of their head. When they got in bed at night after their foot soak, hopefully, they could open the bag and while they were sleeping, the vibrations would draw the negativity out. In the morning, they would fasten it back up and do this for seven nights, if they could. Sometimes the lemons go off and have to be taken away. I can't say hand on heart that they actually went home and did that, but they did keep coming for a little while.

I was asked to go in the Mercedes, which meant I had to hand off my car keys for somebody to bring my car back to the hotel. When we got back, we went into Shri Mataji's room. She was talking to yogis that had come up for the program, saying various things to various people, mostly personal. The makeup bag comes into it again! Mother was asking for her makeup bag. She rummaged in it, got a jar of cream, and she called me over. I'd often seen this happening on stages. She said to take some of the cream and massage her right foot. Sarah Satchell was massaging her left foot. Mother turns to me, "Rub it! Rub it hard! They're like stones!" She wanted me to rub the little toe. It's quite tiring; you're holding yourself back. Then she was talking to Sarah, and it was just amazing. You just can't think. You're doing it and it's like, I can't even believe that I actually got to do this. It is absolutely unbelievable, almost unreal. It's doing something to you. It's like you're not even in your body. So that was happening, and then we had to leave for the night.

The next day was the seminar, and that's when we were running around for the present. They'd arranged a dinner for everybody. The yogis had made Shri Mataji's food in my saucepans, which were going home with me. Shri Mataji was offered her food, and then everybody went and got theirs. It was quite amazing because the girl who was offering Shri Mataji's food said that Shri Mataji seemed to be enormous, she seemed to fill the place, "and I'm handing her this little bit of food." That's just how it felt to her.

Just before lunch, Shri Mataji was giving people jobs. She gave John Noyce, who's in Australia, his job. We all see him when he gives a link to a talk if you've mentioned something Shri Mataji has said. He will find it in the talk. Shri Mataji said his job was to make sure that what was said was true. Because even at that time, in 1985, he got this light prototype for a computer keyboard and was taking our names and addresses. So that's what he was doing, and that's what he's done ever since. He's still doing it. A lot of people won't know that Shri Mataji actually gave him this job. Walter volunteered to do the videos for every single one of Shri Mataji's talks, which is how they all got onto DVD.

After lunch, Shri Mataji said to everybody about Chatsworth House, how beautiful it was and that we should go there. We were on the edge of the Peak District, so they all went off to have a look at this beautiful place, which left only a few of us there.

Shri Mataji had her nap, and then Warren said, "We have to go wake Shri Mataji now." I was thinking, "What? She might want to sleep longer!" But he goes to the door and he's banging on it. I'm thinking, "Oh, she might be upset," but apparently that's what you do. He'd organized the tea for her; they needed to get to the train at a certain time. It just shocked me.

Then I was invited to go in while he went to organize the tea, and I was sitting at Shri Mataji's feet. She'd just been in bed and I'm thinking, "Am I supposed to get up and make the bed?" Anyway, I didn't. It's very interesting because just last night I saw a talk where Shri Mataji was talking about films, about how horrid the films they make nowadays are, and yet there used to be such great films where everything had a moral, there was always a lesson in it. They were all completely innocent, but real entertainment. I'm having to say, "I don't know, Mother," but she was explaining it to me.

Then she asked me about the Indian girls. "I'm sending you lots of Indian girls. How are you finding them?" I said, "Mother, they are so lovely. We are learning so much," which we were. We were learning all the protocols and things. The Indian ladies have this bhakti for Shri Mataji which is so deep. So she'd asked me about that. Then she asked me about Chantal, Ray's wife, because he obviously brought Sahaja Yoga to Sheffield. She said Chantal sends a lot of people to Sahaja Yoga. We actually had a girl who came to Sheffield because Chantal had told her to go to Sahaja Yoga there.

Then her niece came in and started tidying the bed. She looked at me and said, "She wants to do it." She answered my unasked question. Then I think the tea arrived, and I might have had a nice cup of tea. She handed me her stockings, but they only come up to the knee. They're nylons, and she asked me to put them on for her. I was blown away. Shri Mataji wears pop socks! Obviously, you've got to keep your feet warm.

I put one on, and again, I'm touching Mother's feet. She took every opportunity for me to do that. With the second one, I noticed there was a ladder in it, when a thread gets caught and it runs all the way up. I'm looking at it and I think, "Do I need to mention this?" I thought, "Well, it makes no difference if there are no other pairs. Nobody's going to see it because Mother wears a sari." Mother knows everything anyway, so I just put it on.

Then it was time to go. As we were going out, I was settling the bill for the hotel. Shri Mataji was at my side and she's saying, "Let me pay for this." I said, "No, Mother." I'm saying no to Mother! I should have phrased it a bit better. I wrote out the cheque. This is so funny. Shri Mataji was there and she put her hand on my right Vishuddhi and said, "May God bless you." We were waiting, and there was a big display in the hotel of Sheffield cutlery and silver. Shri Mataji was looking at it and she said, "It's a very reasonable price, isn't it?" Like I would know! I don't buy silver. That was a really funny moment.

Then Warren said to me, "Shri Mataji would like to go shopping." So I said, "Okay." I think I must have been driving, following the Mercedes. We went to one shop. No, I'm telling a lie. I must have been in the car with Djamel and Shri Mataji. We stopped at this silverware shop. Warren said, "You have to get out. You have to go with Shri Mataji into the shop." So we did. I think it was two or three shops. Mother was picking all these various things. She said, "I need some silverware. I have to take it from Sheffield to America." She was talking to the shopkeeper, asking him questions about how long he'd been there. Mother always talks to people. Then she was asking if he could do it cheaper. He said, "I can't do it any cheaper than that." I mean, she spent over a thousand pounds, so much money for that time.

Then we were off to the station. The Mercedes was there, full of silver. There were only a few of us there. Shri Mataji gets on the train, Djamel is already in there, and Mother's leaning on the door, talking to us. I think Ilana was there, myself, Warren... there weren't many people. Shri Mataji went in her handbag and pulled out these jade pearls, priceless pearls, and she's handing them to me. She said, "This is for Harris," meaning Ray Harris's mum. She looked at me and said, "I'll get something for you next time." It was like, I don't need anything. She was talking and giving advice to whoever was there, and then the train pulled away. Some people came running up and just missed Shri Mataji. They were a bit upset, but that's just the way she wanted it.

Interviewer: Sorry, what color sari was she wearing at that point, would you remember?

Joan: I can't remember. No. I have tried before to remember the color of that sari.

Interviewer: That's alright. They're all so stunning, aren't they?

Joan: Absolutely. They take your breath away.

Interviewer: Do you want to share with us the things that you have from Shri Mataji, that still give you so much joy and vibrations?

Joan: I don't suppose it's something that I really think about, but doing this, remembering these things, you're right back there. For me, it's working so much out of things. As you get lost in this life, even as yogis, we get into the mire, don't we? We think our housework and what we have for shopping is so important. I look back and I think, what did I do? How did I get to this point? Everything I needed for me to be me, to be completed and to know what I was here for, happened in this lifetime. And that's in a short space of time we're talking about.

As a child, I always wanted some means to know the difference between right and wrong because I could tell some things I was being brought up with were wrong. It was a need in me, this desire to have something where I would know. Looking back, I was always searching. I felt like an alien in my own family, like you're just really acting in this life, that it's not real. It's the fulfillment of that search. When you see people on a bus or something and they're quite happy in themselves, I always wanted to be that person. I was the one looking at everybody else, thinking, "I wonder what's going on in their life," and not being able to get to me. So to come from that life... now, even though my mind can be really chatty, I can be okay. I can be quiet.

It never occurred to me that I would ever meet Shri Mataji. It wasn't just that I went to see her at Hampstead Town Hall, but that she felt me worthy enough that she would come into this life that I am leading. I've had many instances with really incredible experiences, such joy. There have been times I've thought, "Oh, I must be on my way to hell," but then Mother brings you right back up and you're remodeled. Everything gets knocked out so that the stuff you don't need goes away, and then it can be filled.

The awesomeness of not only being in her presence, but that she gave so much to me personally, as well as to everybody around me, everybody here in Sheffield, everybody in the UK, everybody around the world, at the same time, before and after, and even now. Suddenly, I feel like I have grown so much, and I'm so grateful for this opportunity. I feel like I'm expanding again. She actually gave this to us. She gave us this job. She's telling us to radiate this love, for our hearts to be bigger, to touch everybody else's heart wherever you can. And just love. That's all you need to do. You just need to love, because it's all the vibrations. They're the truth, they're the love, they're the consciousness. And we lose that in our day-to-day... "Oh, we'll just run programs, we'll give realisation." But we don't do that being.

It's just so deep in my heart that all these things are buried there. So many of us must have these experiences that, through this, will be allowed to be relived. So I'm so grateful to you.

Interviewer: Thank you so much, Joan, for sharing this. And I thank Shri Mataji for bringing us all together and for making absolutely every moment of our lives a blessing, that we are her children and for everything she has given us. So thank you very much for joining us in the program today. Love from all of us and thank you, Shri Mataji, first and foremost.

Joan: Always. Take care.

Interviewer: You too. Thank you very, very much.
