 (England)
You were at art college. Yes. Please tell us about your experience.

So I am Dutch, but I lived in Belgium with my family, my father being Dutch and my mother being Italian. I went to art college in Belgium, but I never felt really part of that society. I felt like an outsider. So I was very much seeking, and I was aware that people live in a relative world.

I went to Paris, actually driven by a force. I was aware that there was something pulling me towards the south. I remember writing a poem before I left about the Mother. I still have to find it somewhere in the attic of my parents' house. So I was in Paris seeking. I went to a lecture given by TM and wasn't so impressed. I was also looking for some guru-type group that I had been reading about, and I had been to a few of their sessions in Belgium. I couldn't find these people in Paris. Although I had addresses, I couldn't find them. A year later, Shri Mataji said that all the gurus had run away out of Paris when she was there.

Then I was roaming around the Centre Beaubourg. I wanted to do some research in the gallery, and I saw a poster of Shri Mataji—the black and white mudra one, which we all still love because it was used a lot and attracted many people. I went to the meeting. It was early September '81. I was in the hall, and Shri Mataji was there. I didn't understand a word of what she was saying. My English wasn't so good, but I couldn't grasp anything. But I was fascinated.

What also did it for me on the knowledge side was the chakra chart, because it summarized everything I had been trying to understand from books by gurus who speak about the navel chakra or the sahasrara, but never really put the whole picture together in an understandable way. I think that was the game they were playing.

So, I was in the hall there in Paris in very early September '81, and Shri Mataji came around to the people to give realization, followed by a group of yogis who would raise their kundalini collectively. Shri Mataji came to me, and she had a glass of water. She put some water on my sahasrara and said, "Close your eyes." So I closed my eyes. After a while, she said, "Open your eyes." Shri Mataji was smiling with her eyes wide open, two inches from my face. I started laughing, and everyone started laughing, and they felt the vibrations. I didn't feel vibrations at that point, but that was fun.

Then she went to the next person and asked me to hold the glass for her. That did something; it made me feel like I was part of this family, part of her work. She was asking me to join in. That really did something, because then I found myself going to the yogis who were working on other people. I just wanted to join in and help raise people's kundalinis, even though I didn't know what I was doing.

There was a follow-up meeting two days later in Paris, and I went to that as well. I remember we were allowed to ask some questions. I asked her, "What do you do, Shri Mataji, to harmonize the desire and the action?" because it's very difficult to bring these two together. She explained what she does, whereby you have the left and the right channel, and when they come closer, you get one channel in the middle. She said, "That's the kundalini." And when it rises fully, the two channels are totally in harmony and become one. Mother did this: if the two come together, you get the third channel in the middle, and ultimately, it becomes one. You're totally one with the kundalini, with Mother's power. Then I had a strong experience.

There was another follow-up meeting, but not in Paris—it was in Lille, two hours north. I hitchhiked to Lille the next morning. I arrived at the public program, and Shri Mataji saw me and smiled. But she was different; she had a different aspect. She looked rounder and smiled, but also in a very powerful way, not just a sweet smile, but a sort of knowing smile. Later I realized, I thought she was like in Ganesha form.

Then she came around to the people again. I felt dreadful. I had been drinking a lot, and I felt really bad, aching in my body. I sat down, and she came round. I asked her, "Shri Mataji, I would like to be delivered from all negative energy." She said, "You are already delivered." I didn't understand it because I felt dreadful. But later it dawned upon me what it was.

Two more things to add, because it brought me to London the same week. I was planning to go to the south of France, and I had a return ticket from Belgium to Paris, but I lost it. So I was in Lille, and after that program, some people from Lille invited me to their flat. When I arrived, all the yogis were outside. Phil Ward was there and, I think, Arnaud. Shri Mataji had just had a puja there on the Sunday after the program, and she had left. These people invited me into the flat, so I sat there with all the yogis who had just had a puja, and they invited me to stay the night.

They were telling me, "You should go to London. Shri Mataji lives there. There's Chelsham Road. We just had weddings there." This was in August 1981. They said, "Go to Chelsham Road. You can meet Shri Mataji. She will talk to you." I said, "Okay, yeah."

So I went. I hitchhiked again, and I never in my life had such an easy hitchhike. Someone picked me up, and on the boat, I met someone else who gave me a lift to London and allowed me to sleep at their flat. Everything was very smooth. That was a sign for me that something had changed.

Another thing that had changed was that overnight after my first meeting, I woke up with a big spot above my navel, which stayed there for a long time. It was like a physical sign that the kundalini wasn't just talk; it was actually having a physical impact on clearing me out.

Then I arrived in London at Chelsham Road. That was the address I was given. Someone opened the door and said, "It's not here that it's happening. It's in Bramham Gardens." So I went to Bramham Gardens. Nick Kurzweil opened the door, and I saw him look at this guy with long hair and a rucksack. I saw that he was hesitating whether to let me in or not. So I owe him for letting me in.

Shri Mataji was there and gave some talks in the living room. Then she said that I could stay. So I stayed in the room of a guy called Daniel. He spoke to me all evening about Shri Mataji and the Divine and that she's God. So I got the whole knowledge there. That night, there was a candle in front of Shri Mataji's picture. He gave me his bed, and I lay on the bed, looked at the candle and Mother's photograph, and I could not sleep the whole night. I had the strongest vibrational experience I've ever had. It was like a waterfall going through me, but I was like paralyzed the whole night.

The next morning, Shri Mataji went to America, in September '81. We all went to the airport. I was so tired; I hadn't slept all night and still felt dreadful, actually. Shri Mataji arrived and saw me. She just came straight to me, smiling, and held her hand out. I spontaneously put my hand on her hand. It was a sign that she was saying to me that she knew what she had been doing, that she was the one who had been giving me that incredible experience during the night.
