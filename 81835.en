On August the 11th, one of the world's greatest living saints, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi will arrive in Toronto to teach her program for self-realization. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi offers a system of meditation that emphasizes the need for people to become their own guru. Her technique, called Sahaja Yoga, uses signals and sensations called vibrations felt on the central nervous system to achieve greater awareness and deeper intuition.

Today in our studio we have two guests. The followers of Mataji Nirmala Devi, Professor of Psychiatry and Biomedical Sciences at McMaster University, Hamilton, and Dr. Ram Mishra, and Gregoire de Galber-Mathan, Chief of Policy Planning and Evaluation Unit at the Capital Development Fund, United Nations, New York. Gentlemen, welcome to Sounds of Asia.

Gregoire: Thank you.

Dr. Ram: Thank you.

Interviewer: Gregoire, tell us, what is Sahaja Yoga?

Gregoire: Well, Lalit, in a nutshell, if I start from etymology, Sahaja means inborn, and Yoga means what religare means in Latin, means to unite or union. So Sahaja Yoga means that the union or the right of being united with one-self is inborn in each people. And, you know, there are many yogas around, I mean, we are trodding a mall where there are a lot of shops. There is a big guru shopping center around. And like everybody, I looked around and saw what was offered. I met Shri Mataji about 15 years ago and I had met various teachers or so-called teachers before I met her. And She was just very different. She was extremely genuine and extremely compassionate and was showing an incredible spiritual capacity to trigger an experience of self-realization. Capacity which I had seen with nobody else. So I think it is fair to say that Sahaja Yoga is a very ancient system that we can find references of in ancient scriptures and books and various cultural traditions. But Shri Mataji says that She is not, in a sense, offering anything new. She is offering something very ancient. But what is new is that She makes it available for her own experience to enter into that dimension. And, you see, at the United Nations, we are meant to think globally because the problems of the world today offer such a magnitude that if the agent of action which is man does not transform himself, the claim to transform the world will remain futile. I mean, I can see it in my work and everybody who reads the newspaper knows it. So I was attracted to this yoga as an efficient method to transform oneself, to become a better person effectively, spiritually but also at various levels of daily life. And from there on, on the basis of this experience, I found it worthwhile to share the information with people who are interested in this.

Interviewer: Dr. Ramishra, tell us what is the difference between Sahaja Yoga and other yogas?

Dr. Ram: Before, Laliji, I say about that, I might just add one more sentence to Gregoire, what he just said. The Shri Mataji acts like a banker, like you go to the bank and you withdraw your own money, the banker gives you own money. So what She gives you is actually what you really have. So it's the self-realization you already have, you already born with that. And She gives you what you have actually. So She acts like a banker.

Interviewer: Okay.

Dr. Ram: The difference between Sahaja Yoga and other yogas are quite a few but I'll just list them from a simplicity point of view. One is that it's cheap, It doesn't cost any money. Other yogas cost a lot of money, like hundreds and thousands of dollars and takes a long time to appreciate what you are learning. Here, the situation is spontaneous. You are with yourself very quickly without spending any penny. And it's free. And the second thing is that with other yogas, sometimes it is difficult to know whether you are really learning whether you are really achieving something. Here, you have direct proof. In Hindi, we call it Brahma Chaitanya which flows on your hands. You experience that Brahma Chaitanya on your hands. And right away, you know whether the things are working out for you, whether you are advancing spiritually or you are not advancing. Whereas in the other yogas, you have to go to your gurus, true or false, whatever and you have to spend the money and the guru then actually monitors your progress. Here, you monitor your own progress. And not only yours but you can also feel collectively the progress of other people who are following the same yoga.

Interviewer: You just told us that there is no money involved in this. But how are you running your institution then?

Dr.Ram: No money involved for self-realization.

Interviewer: I see.

Dr.Ram: No money involved for getting the self-realization from Shri Mataji or one of the yogis who are practicing this yoga. There is no fee. There is no fee charged. If somebody comes to the ashram or to one of us and takes a taxi, of course, he has to pay for the taxi. Shri Mataji or I am not supposed to pay for the taxi.

Interviewer: Of course. Gregoire tell us, how come you make sound, self-realization so easy? It used to be a very difficult task.

Gregoire: Yes, that's very true. I think the answer is that like everything else, spirituality has to be understood in an evolutionary context. Self-realization was called samadhi in India. In the great Indian spiritual tradition, it was called satori with a Zen Buddhist. It also had references in the Christian tradition as Lord Jesus Christ said it, we have to be born twice. We have to be born from the spirit. Now, the whole point is that many instructors of mankind prepared us for this experience. Some of the most deserving human beings in the past got the self-realization. And Shri Mataji used a very simple but beautiful image.

She says, when you have a tree which blossoms in winter, then, of course, it's a miracle. It blossoms under the snow. If, on the contrary, it blossoms when spring comes, it's no more a miracle. It's the force, the strength of nature. In the same way, She says that people who got the self-realization in the past, when it was so difficult, those were the miracles. They were the flowers in the middle of the winter. But the time has come, the spring, the blossom time, says Shri Mataji, has come for all those who seek it honestly to reach that higher level of awareness which is called self-realization. And therefore, in this moment of evolution where we have joined this crucial turning point of the end of the millennium, the possibility is open for those who seek it to discover their own beauty, in a sense, their own spiritual magnitude.

Interviewer: Right, okay. Gentleman, tell us, when is she arriving in Toronto, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi? What is Her program?

Dr. Ram: She's arriving on Sunday, the 12th but the programs are on August the 13th, Monday. And August the 14th on Tuesday, at 7 o'clock.
