A great blessing to you. Then you must know how to preserve it, must know how to enhance it, and must know how to enjoy it. You should not just get satisfied with one dance drama or one thing or another. You should have a full oneness with the Divine, full oneness. And that is possible only if you really meditate, which is quite an easy thing to do.

Some people say, "Mother, we cannot get over time, we cannot think, we are all the time thinking something, or at that time we want to see the watch." In the beginning, you may have a little problem. I am not saying you may not have; you may have. But that's only in the beginning. You will be all right. Gradually you will master it. Gradually you will know it so well that you would not like to have anything else of a cheaper type. You wouldn't care for such a thing. So to get to your beauty, to get to your glory, to get to your own great personality, which is now exposed to you, what you have to do really, religiously, is to meditate.

That's not, "Tonight I came very late, so I did not meditate," or "Tomorrow, I have to go for work, so I cannot meditate." Nobody wants to know the excuses. It's between you and yourself. It is your gain, nobody else's. It's for your gain everything has happened. Now one has to know that we have achieved a certain height of evolution. And from this height, you might go up further and further. I'm not saying it's not possible to do that. But first and foremost, whatever you may be, you may consider yourself to be a very high-class Sahaja Yogi, but you have to be humble about meditation.

This meditative quality... even when I'm talking to you, I am getting into it because it's so joy-giving. You just jump into the ocean of joy. First, it will be difficult, but after some time, you will know that this connection that you have with Shri Mataji is the only connection that you are looking out for.

And also, there is another point people get lost with, which I have seen is very common. They meditate individually, very much, which is very correct. Individually they will meditate. They will sit down, meditate, do puja, but collectively they will not meditate. So this is another point one has to remember: you have to be collectively meditating. Because I am a collective being of all of you. And when you meditate collectively, you are really very close to Me. So even if you have a program or something, you must do some meditation with it. Always have meditation as the priority for any program. You sing the songs, it's over, everything is done. Then you meditate. If I am insisting on something, you must know that this must be the truth I am telling you, absolutely the basis of it. Though it looks rather mundane, it's very important.

Now for us to worship Adi Shakti... I don't know what, because there have been no prayers or anything about Adi Shakti. Up to Bhagawati they have gone, but beyond Bhagawati they have not gone. So I don't know what sort of pujas you will have, but let's try something, maybe. I think that meditation is the best way we can really achieve something. So we can go into meditation for about five minutes. Please close your eyes.

Thank you all for being here, and it's good to meet with everyone virtually. So since we're talking about Canajoharie, I'll tell you the story of how it all started.

This was in October of 1994. The exact date, I don't remember, but it was right after we did the programs in Chicago. After that, we came to New York, and Shri Mataji was staying at the Holiday Inn right next to LaGuardia Airport. It was in the morning and, as usual, I got up, made her tea, offered her tea, and got her the newspaper. We were just having some light conversation and suddenly she looked at this little ad. It was very hard to find that ad, but she went straight to that advertisement for the Canajoharie land. As I was talking to Joe earlier, Shri Mataji talked about the fact that she saw vibrations just coming from there. Yes, she did say that. She saw vibrations coming from there.

So she told me, she said, "Call Manoj." I called Manoj. She talked to him and asked him to get hold of the realtor. I don't remember the name of the realtor. Then he said, "Shri Mataji, he's available. Would you like to see the property?" And she said, "Yes."

The next day, we drove down from New York to Canajoharie. It took, I think, four hours plus to get to the place. We went straight to the land. The realtor was there. By the time we got there, it was getting to be evening. There was still light, but it was kind of getting to dusk. He heard us talking to each other, speaking to Shri Mataji as "Shri Mataji" or "Mother." So he turned to her and said, "Mother, would you like to see the property?" And she said, "Yes." He had an SUV, and she got onto his SUV, and he drove Shri Mataji all around the property. She came back and she said, "We're buying it." Then, of course, whatever payment details had to be figured out, those were figured out.

I know that we drove back to New York that evening. The next day, the money was transferred, and the purchase was put into process. But there is a McDonald's right off the road when you get onto the freeway. As we were getting to the freeway, Shri Mataji said, "Well, we have to celebrate." So we all went to McDonald's and we had hamburgers, fries, and Coke. She had a Diet Coke; we had our Cokes. So that is the story of how Canajoharie started. The rest of it, you're aware of. Shri Mataji came there several times. The next thing I know was that she said we have to get the hangar, so that was worked on. But the beginning story is a very short one.

This ad was so teeny. If you really had to go through the paper, you would have a hard time finding it. But she went straight to the advertisement, and next, Canajoharie was purchased. So that's the short story, and I'm glad that I was able to share it with you.

Right. So I remember when we were looking at the name, Canajoharie. 'Kanha' is one of the names of Lord Krishna. His mother, Shri Yashoda, used to call him Kanha. And 'Hari' is the name of Shri Vishnu. So Canajoharie is Lord Krishna is Hari, meaning he's Vishnu himself. It's amazing that the place she finds in America has that name. And it is the name given by the indigenous, the native people. The divine always arranges things in her own way.

I was just telling Jo also, the property that she purchased in Los Angeles was in Calabasas. But if you say it the Indian way, 'Kalibasa,' it is the place of the Mother Kali. She has her own way of doing things. Even in a far-fetched place like the U.S., you still find these things. She used to say that the Indians knew about and used to talk of Adi Shakti as the Great-Grandmother. And also, I think in Colombia, they talked of the blue-colored god who rode this big bird, which is again, Shri Krishna or Shri Vishnu on his Garuda. So that's my part. That's the little part that I had to share. It was very simple. We were not planning any of this stuff. It was very straightforward, and that's how Canajoharie came to be Sahaj land.

Yes, I don't remember the exact amount, but it was somewhere around $50,000. That was the purchase price for the property. The second day, Shri Mataji went and saw the property. The third day, the money was transferred, and the purchase was in process. Of course, the paperwork and all that had to be done. But I think it was about a good year or two, maybe three years, that everybody said, "No, Shri Mataji, we should pay for this land. You found it for us." So then the money was collected and given to Shri Mataji. That's the story of Canajoharie.

Actually, I was going to talk a little bit about what happened before, during the 80s. Because Canajoharie was a fulfillment of discussions and hints that we had gotten on previous visits of Shri Mataji to New York. During the 80s, she had said that she would buy land in New York, and that the vibrations in upstate New York were very good. There wasn't much discussion about it, and I didn't hear it directly; I was hearing this through our leaders. Nothing happened, but it was just known that this would happen at some point, that Shri Mataji had the interest in getting a property upstate.

I know that during the 80s, we had a seminar upstate where people who got their realization in New York were able to go that same weekend to a seminar with Shri Mataji. It was around that time that she said if we had a place of our own upstate, then people could go on retreats and would be able to get much deeper than they would by just coming to weekly meetings in a big city. The reason I'm mentioning this is because practically all the things that Shri Mataji talked to us about—what we could do with the land and what its purpose was—were fulfillments of our desires. Someone in the collective, or probably more than one of us, shared the same dreams. We had gone to seminars that we organized for our small collectives, and the thought came up, the idea was discussed: "Why don't we have our own place?" It was there, and then it was fulfilled later on. Yogis can talk about things for a long time, but Shri Mataji propelled it. As Manish said, it happened so quickly. And for a long period of time after she purchased the land, it was like that; everything happened very quickly.

I'll just add something to what Manish had mentioned. Perhaps it was the day after Shri Mataji drove up and saw the land that some yogis were sent up to look at it, maybe before the final purchase was made, just to double-check. Amongst those who went up, there was an engineer primarily who had to come, and I was his navigator. I sat next to him. For me, this is one of the most significant things from that time.

Whoever has driven to Canajoharie from New York, from the south, drives up north and then goes west along the Mohawk River. It's a very striking view; it's unforgettable. You're driving along the Mohawk for half an hour or so before you get to the Canajoharie exit. I was sitting next to this engineer, Subhash, his name was. Shri Mataji wanted him to go, or perhaps it was his idea, I don't remember. I wasn't in the hotel myself, but I somehow got involved in coming up to see the property.

So anyway, I was his navigator. I had the map of New York in my lap, and I was looking down at it, looking at the route we were driving, and also looking at this view on the right-hand side. We went up, we looked at the property, he talked to the realtor about something. I think he was trying to reduce the price. He actually called Shri Mataji at one point, and—I think probably no one has heard this before—she said, "What about the other property?" There was some other property that the realtor had shown her or mentioned at one point. This may have been just a drama, maybe just to put the realtor on edge. I don't know the reason why, but she did ask about another property, and he was very surprised to hear her ask about it. There was a bit of tension I could feel in the conversation.

Finally, after looking at everything, and I think the realtor agreeing to another thousand dollars off, the yogi I was with was very proud of himself that he could make a contribution by reducing the price, although it was extremely cheap. As Manish said, it was 114 acres for around $50,000.

Anyway, we drove back, and we had to drive fairly quickly because Shri Mataji was leaving from the airport. This was probably the next day after she went up. We wanted to bid her farewell, and Subhash probably had something to convey to her. So we drove back down and we saw her off. Afterwards, I went home, and I sat down feeling really good, how you feel after seeing Shri Mataji. You're just completely enveloped in vibrations, like no meditation can ever make you feel. I just sat down on the couch and switched on the TV.

But what happened when I switched on the TV is that the image on the screen was a very striking image of a river. It was an aerial video, moving above the river, and it just made me sit up straight in my chair. I thought, "I've seen this before." This was immediately after, the same day that we came back from driving there. The narrator starts talking and talks about Canajoharie. Then, superimposed over the screen, fading in, is a map of New York State, and it's zooming in to Canajoharie and the river. It's just what I was looking at. It was the same map I had in my hands as I was being the navigator.

For me, it was like... even though she had left and I was back in the Bronx, living with my mother in a kind of dingy area, it just brought me so much closer. It was a big point in my life. This incident, this coincidence, was organized for my benefit, to understand the significance of what had happened that day. I didn't know what it was. It was a documentary about the Mohawk Indians. I didn't know why this video was there at that time exactly.

Later, when she had the public program in Albany, the Mohawks came—those who had their reservation in Canajoharie. By the way, our land isn't in Canajoharie; it's in Minden, which is in the village of Fort Plain. But that's the exit you see, and that's how we've always referred to it. Anyway, the Mohawks came to her public program, and they recognized her. They gave her some gifts, and they said she was... I don't remember the exact words, but they recognized her as a divine person.

When we went to McDonald's with Shri Mataji, she was waiting while some people went to get the order. She looked at the yogis that were standing nearby and she said all of our cheeks were pink. She then explained that they were pink because of the atmosphere, the air upstate, that there was no pollution.

After that, we started having seminars on the land. Some yogis, Mark Sutherland and others, organized our first seminars. Though we didn't have anything on the land, we rented tents, had caterers make food... there was no electricity, no road, it was just land. But yogis were very interested in being there. Inevitably, it would rain, and people would get stuck, but that didn't stop people from coming. People wanted to be there.

We started thinking about how we could make these weekends more like the seminars we've had in other places. So what do we need? We can cook for ourselves instead of having caterers, because the food wasn't plentiful enough or it was expensive. So the yogis who came, we started thinking, how can we do this better? We started bringing portable gas stoves. We started talking to the neighbors. The closest neighbor had water and used to bring a hose for us so that we could have fresh water. And we started renting the port-a-potties.

People used to come, but the rain kept coming as well. Maybe you've heard these stories before. It used to rain so much, and the people around used to say, "The yogis are coming, that's why it's raining." They actually said that. So we were inevitably walking around in mud. Our boots, our shoes, everything was in mud.

I'm telling you all this because whenever we had these events, the leader, Manoj, used to talk to Shri Mataji and tell her what we'd been doing with the land. He actually used to get up at four in the morning and talk to her about different things, and the land was something that was in her attention. He told her things that we were doing, like the seminars. We also built a little house or shed. Actually, we intended to make a shed so we didn't have to carry things back and forth. Then we thought we'd make it into two stories because we heard Shri Mataji might come, that there might be a puja here, and so we should have a place for her to stay. It wasn't very well planned out; it was just very spontaneous, very innocently thought out that we could host Shri Mataji in this little two-story shed. Of course, it never happened, but the fact that we did that, and the fact that yogis from Canada and mostly around the East Coast, but also from the West Coast, came out who were excited about having land... the attention we put on it pleased Shri Mataji. This is the feedback we got from Manoj.

There was Manoj, one person talking to Shri Mataji on a daily basis, and he was talking to people who were excited about being there, who had dreams about what this place could be for us. Everyone had a dream. I think this was why things grew and why things seemed to happen very quickly. Her attention was on it. She really wanted us to use the land. She was so supportive of suggestions. She'd hear a suggestion from a yogi, and then she'd repeat it to others.

At one point, some yogi said we should make cabins. So she said to Manoj, "Why don't you cut the trees there and make cabins out of them?" So he asked me to go up and take a look and see how we could do that. She gave very specific directions. She said, "You cut the tree, and then you pour tar on the base so that it won't grow back. And take the logs and put them someplace until they dry out, and then you can make the log cabins out of them." She gave very specific instructions on how to do things, because though we had desires, we didn't always have the knowledge. She helped us get unstuck.

Anyway, I went up. It turned out that the trees weren't big enough to make log cabins out of, so it didn't go any further.

Later on, the hangar was on the horizon. It was something that was discussed. Manoj would talk to Shri Mataji about it. We knew that they had one in Cabella, and a yogi in Australia had helped them put it up. We got a video from that yogi showing how it can be put up. At some point, we started looking at the availability of hangars in the US. There were plans that I'd send to Manoj, and he would send them to Shri Mataji. We were looking at different sizes, quite a big hangar, much bigger than the one we ended up getting.

It's like our characteristic; we have often not moved quick enough on suggestions. So it was three weeks before the puja that Shri Mataji was coming for Adi Shakti puja, and we were supposed to have a hangar. She asked, "So how's the construction going?" And nothing had been bought. We ended up getting something smaller, which we have now. Miraculously though, someone found one, and it was already constructed. These things take time to put together, so you have to order them in advance. Somehow it got up in that short period of time. So many yogis came together, so many were excited about it. It was a big milestone that we would have this place, a hangar.

When we built the hangar, the idea of a road came up because of all the mud. Shri Mataji didn't say to put the hangar by the main road; she said to put it up top. That's where we put it, and that's more than a quarter of a mile up the road. But when we put the hangar in, we didn't do a road. I think Shri Mataji knew our limits. She always proposed things within our limits. They might be a little bit beyond the limits, so we'd have to stretch a lot, but they were not extraordinary steps. The road was a big thing; we did that during the following year.

When we talked to her about the road, she said, "What you do is get a roller, a big roller, one of those big construction vehicles used for paving." She said, "That will pack down the earth, will make it hard so that you won't get stuck in the mud." She also said, "The trucks coming up and down delivering, they will pack down the road." So she wasn't concerned that year. And that year when the hangar was put up, the weather was pretty good. It wasn't the mud year.

She called the land Nirmal Nagari. She was very much involved, very supportive. She gave us so many suggestions about what we could do with the land. The sky was the limit. She even said at one point she wanted to have a golf course there. The thing is, when ideas came up, a lot of yogis deliberated over them. "Can we do this? How can we do it? How much will it cost?" She really pulled us through all that. She didn't have limitations on what we could do with it.

Before we put up the hangar, Shri Mataji had a meeting with a handful of yogis, maybe six or eight of us, in New York where she was staying. She showed us where to put the road, where the parking lot would be, where the hangar would be. She showed which side of the hangar the stage would go and how it should be oriented. While we were looking at the map, someone said, "The neighbors, they're cutting your grass." She responded, "Oh, that's all right. They'll help you. The neighbors will help you."

That became a mantra, because there were so many troubles we got into, including getting stuck in the mud, so many hurdles we had in getting things done. And talking to the neighbors got it resolved. We were putting in the road and had to put a culvert in. No one has ever put a culvert in. A guy is just driving by, and he says, "Oh, what are you doing?" "Putting a culvert in." "Okay, let me get on." He jumps on the tractor and says, "Yeah, you dig out a little bit here and you level it like this." And that was it, and then he drove away. This kind of thing happened over and over again. The neighbors, especially one set of neighbors, the McGoverns, were very, very helpful.

Hi everyone. Some of you know me very well. I started off in London, and Mother sent me back to America to do the work here. So I've been here since 1993, and when the land was purchased in '94, very soon after that, I managed to get the enthusiasm to travel up frequently to Canajoharie, which was quite the amazing place. As Michael can attest, we always felt rejuvenated and amazing after we got back.

Camping was very basic; we didn't have a lot of facilities. By the time I joined some of the pujas, there were maybe 25 to 40 people maximum. We cooked for ourselves and we swam in the ponds. Then, miracle of miracles, they built the hangar. Shortly after the hangar, there was the first little kitchen. But apparently, it was not constructed in the right spot, so a second one was then developed and built. At the same time, they also built the bathhouse, and in between, there was meant to be a children's playground.

At some point, I was drawn into all of this enthusiasm, even though remotely, through Michael. They would talk to Shri Mataji, and then he would tell me things, and I would go back to my drawing table and draw things up.

There was a lot of rain, and we did have wellingtons. Everybody wore boots, and we lost shoes in the mud as well. It was quite hilarious. I remember being in one small pendal, maybe 35 feet long by 20 feet wide. It rained all weekend. We cooked, we had Havan, and we had Puja, all under this one pendal. And we slept there too because it was raining so hard. But we all had a great time, and we were so thankful that we had the McGoverns as our neighbors, because they would pull us out of the mud regularly with their tractor. It was quite the beginning for an untold amount of adventures.

I had moved to Rochester, New York, and we were living about two hours away. Michael said, "Shri Mataji has expressed interest in buying a house." For the 1999 and 2000 Adi Shakti Pujas, they had rented houses for her. She expressed interest, and Michael described to me that we should find a house for her in the area. So, we went to two or three different realtors and we looked at as many properties as you can imagine. We scouted them out for Shri Mataji, sending quick hand drawings to Manoj to show her in Cabella, and she kept saying, "No, no, no, not this one."

Michael: Inevitably, Shri Mataji always said no. And then what did she say?

Jo: It just so happened...

Michael: Someone came across an advertisement for a double-wide, a manufactured home. It was like a poster, an 8x12 sheet of paper, and it had a list of all the amenities. You could put down $40,000 or $50,000 and have it delivered.

Jo: And Shri Mataji said, "Why look for houses?" She said, "I'll take two of them." The house was to be built on the land.

Michael: And that turned out to be a bit of a Maya, that two-house thing. We had to get a permit. The townspeople said, "Okay, you're a religious organization. Normally, it's one house, one piece of land. But you can have two houses, a congregation building, all kinds of things. All we want is for you to tell us everything you're planning to do. Write it up in a master plan, and then you can apply for permits as you need them."

Jo: Yes, I got busy on the drafting table. But it was really interesting how we found the location for Shri Mataji's house. We were walking around the land... the hangar was already there, and the house needed to be fairly close to the road because of the access problem with the mud. So we walked around the property in the front, checking vibrations, for where this house should be.

Michael: That's right. A team of yogis said that this was the coolest spot. It was a place where a yogi had planted pine trees. His idea was that we'd have Christmas trees to sell in the future. But it really was the best spot for a house. It was also somewhat hidden, so it's not right in the middle of all the traffic. When you and I and others looked at it, it was very clear this was going to be the spot. And that's where it ended up being.

Jo: And then we had to worry about the infrastructure: a driveway, a slab, a place for the well and the septic, electrical access... all those things had to be permitted and done within two months. A very short period of time. Shri Mataji herself picked everything. She chose all the finishes and furniture.

Michael: I know that Manoj told us she picked it. She might have; some things he decided, just being very practical. But she was very pleased with everything. Though it was a manufactured home that many people were skeptical about, she really liked the home. And it was built very quickly. During the same time, the house she was building in New Jersey was also going on. There were two occasions when she was coming to visit and stayed in Canajoharie because the house in New Jersey wasn't built yet.

Jo: And then came the rains of the 2000 Adi Shakti Puja. That was the year Shri Mataji had asked us to also host weddings. That was a huge undertaking. Not just preparing the land and her house, but modifications had to be made to the house. It had to be enlarged because we needed a new room. We had gigantic pendals for everybody to sleep in. We still had the same bathhouse and the second kitchen, and we had to manage to cook not just for the yogis, but also for the weddings.

We had to somehow get all the brides and all the grooms ready and down to the hangar without getting covered with mud. So there was this battalion of people with wellies and umbrellas to escort each and every bride or groom down to the hangar in a procession so that they couldn't see each other and so that they would stay dry and clean. It was a huge undertaking, a lot of fun, a crazy time, because it rained pretty much non-stop. The mud was very deep. Holding up these ladies' heavy saris, holding umbrellas over them while they were all beautiful with their decoration and makeup and jewelry... it was quite an undertaking.

How this got done, we don't know. How we fed a thousand people, we don't know. How we made the beautiful repast for the marriages, it just all got done. I was on the kitchen team that year, so I was part of not just helping the brides but actually cooking for the whole crowd. It was a beautiful time, quite amazing. The vibrations were incredible. And to see all of this unfold out of this very humble place, this beautiful land... to come together to have such an event was just spectacular. Everybody, from the smallest child to the eldest adult, had the best time of their lives. Just to be there on the land, just to be with Shri Mataji, just to witness how far we had come already from the very humble beginning of this teeny, tiny little advertisement in the New York Times. I think that wraps it up for me.
