All right?

Felicity, you better sit on some chair, be careful. Are you all right? Yes, yes, it's all right, be careful. It's expels, eh? All right. So, should we start now? Is it all right? Are we focused, just? Yes, it's okay. Forgive Me now and then I'll turn away and look at the time.

I'll just be checking. I'll do that for some reason. It's all right. That's enough. Or an extension, if you have an extension cord, that would work too. Do you want to just hold a watch? That would be perfectly all right too, if I could borrow a watch from somebody. It's a digital one, I'm afraid. I'm not going to be on camera so I can look at the watch and do all sorts of things. You can do what you like.

I'm going to jingle it around. It takes too long. Not rolling yet. Are you rolling? Just the legs. Legs, okay. I'm setting up. Just resetting it. Is the telephone off the hook? Yes, it is.

When the little one may start crying. That would be nice. That would be a nice sound. Neck. You must look after the neck of the baby. That's the Vishuddhi. That's the little motherhood. So about fifty minutes. We'll make it about fifty minutes long. Alright.

I will answer in short, would be better. Whatever you feel like. Because how many questions you'll ask, it depends on. I don't know. Depends on how long your answers are. I can go on. It's all spontaneous. So ten twenty. If we started at ten twenty, what time? Fifty minutes later, please.

So if we start at ten twenty, then if we finish at eleven ten, that's fifty minutes? Fifty minutes will do. It could be long then. Okay. You can roll. Mataji, in order to understand the process of realization, which is very complicated and almost has a kind of scientific discipline to it, but first maybe you could say a word about the goal in order to anchor our discussion. So could you say something about the highest realization, what the goal of this entire process is? The goal of this process is, to begin with, we should say, is to become the Spirit. The Spirit is the reflection of our Creator, the God Almighty in our heart, which is the collective being within us. Now of course this is all a theory for you, and you can take as a hypothesis, but it's a fact and can be found out.

After you get your Self-realization, you feel the manifestation of the Spirit in your nervous system, in your conscious mind. This is the goal, to begin with. You see, if you talk of the very higher things, it could be confusing. So the first is Self-realization. That is the first goal. You said that the Spirit, you define the Spirit as the reflection of God Almighty in the heart. Yes, please. What is, what do you mean by God Almighty? God Almighty is the one who is everything. He is the one who is the Creator.

He is the one who has desire to create, the one who is, can destroy if he has no desires left, And He is the one who gives us sustenance, who gives us this evolution by which we have become human beings. He is the entire thing. It is all His play. I was under the impression that the Kundalini was Mother Kundalini and that, that this energy was feminine, and now you refer to the Divine as He. Yes, He is Divine and She is also Divine, both could be Divine. But He is the one who is the witness of the play of His desire, and His desire is the Primordial Kundalini, is the Primordial Mother, is the Holy Ghost, as they call it. And She is reflected within us as the Kundalini. When this reflection that is the Kundalini meets the reflection that is the Spirit, then the yoga takes place, then the union takes place. What was, what was the Divine doing before it created anything? It was sleeping.

It was complete silence and then it awoke. When it is awakened, a creation is created out of His power. But He is just the witness. Is, is the goal to participate in the Divine play or to return to the complete silence? First is to get into that play, to become one with the whole. That is the first goal, as I said. And you, you don't think it would be helpful to speak about anything beyond that? Just now it can be dangerous, you see. This is difficult for people in the West who don't understand the idea of, of a secret teaching that unfolds as, as a person develops. They, they overhear, we think that we can hear everything all at once.

You see, it is a living process. And in the West I don't know how many have studied living processes. Living process is never like that. First the seed, then the roots, then the tree, then the leaves and then the flowers and then the fruit. See, so the, it is a living process. Now we are human beings at the stage when we are flowers. Now we have to become the fruits. Then the fruit has to grow. Once we understand living process, we can understand why. We have to first get Self-realization.

That's why Buddha did not talk of God. Because if you talk of God, it's too far-fetched. So better to talk of Self-realization first he thought. Because if you talk of something abstract, then people get fizzled out. So as a spiritual mother you, you teach your children and show them how to become one with the entire cosmic play? Yes, first of all to become the, your microcosm should become one with the macrocosm. First feel that, first understand that and then grow into it. Now how do your, your disciples or your spiritual children do this? It's obviously not just a matter of philosophy, but thinking about it, how do they proceed along the path? As I said it's a living process and for living process you cannot do anything about it.

It's spontaneous. But as in the living process you have seen that if you have to sprout a seed, you have to put it to the Mother Earth. And the Mother Earth has the capacity to sprout it spontaneously. You don't have to do anything about it. In the same way if I am the Mother Earth, if you put your hands towards Me you can get your realization. It's very simple. But once you get realization, you can also give realization to others by raising their Kundalini because from your hand that Divine power starts flowing. For the first time after realization you start feeling the Divine power. Many things happen though I said it's slow, but it's very fast. It's so, so fantastic and so dynamic that even Self-realization is difficult to contain.

Many spiritual traditions they'll talk about spiritual cultivation. It's a, if you just put a seed in the Earth and just leave it to chance, many, many, many unfortunate things can happen. Are there any disciplines or protections that your students engage in? For instance, dietary restrictions or formal meditation or different practices? I don't think you need it anymore. You have done it in previous lives now. You have had enough of it. You don't need anymore now. What you need is your realization. The trouble is we must also understand that the creation of God is the epitome, is the human race and it is on the brink of its destruction.

So the Divine itself has taken steps to see that forgive everything. Now just get them realized, you see. It's like emergency, you can say, or the last judgment has started or the resurrection time as described by Mohammed Sahib has started. He has precisely once said that your hands will speak what Sahaja Yoga is doing. He's all described also by many saints thousands of years back, the seers who have described the coming of Sahaja Yoga in those days. So you feel that you have experienced or you have the vision that the human race is living in the last days in a time of unusual cosmic emergency and flowering? Of course, no doubt about it. Without that they would not take to God also. This is something with human beings. Unless and until they are put to that kind of a frantic condition, they just don't look at things.

But haven't human beings almost always felt that way? I mean, hasn't there always been a frantic condition? Haven't spiritual teachers, most of them always warned people that there is not much time left and that they're living in the last days? I don't think they did that way because most of them said that this will happen. They always talked of future. All the prophets have talked of the future of this time. Even William Blake who came hundred years back has talked about it. Everybody has talked about this time that this blossom time will come and that is the time many flowers will become fruits. And if these, why precarious? Because at that time it's a very delicate time.

At the time when you are flowers it's easy to destroy. It's beautiful that you call it a blossoming time. I mean, many, many people who predict the doom, doom, doomsday would call this time of great destruction but you're calling it a time of blossom. Yes, first the blossom, then the doom. The blossom because you have to become the fruits. And once you have become the fruits, the rest is useless, is thrown away so that you can call as a doom day. But first God must give us, give you complete chance to be the flowers, to be the fruits. Isn't it? In His compassion. The students who gather around you, as you call them, your spiritual children, are they of different levels of capacity or can all of them receive this realization and transmit it to others?

All of them. All of them can receive. As long as you are a human being you can get realization. But there are sometimes very complicated people. They have had attacks, they have had physical problems, mental problems, emotional problems. There are special category, of course. There are some people who are a special category. Maybe you may not find that seeking in some people. But once you have established a quite a number of people who are realized souls, the others will follow them. So you feel that just being human itself, just having the human soul and the human body is enough for realization?

Enough, enough for realization. Is that somewhat different than traditional Indian teaching? It is not different. But I am different, I think. Perhaps I am endowed with something special that I can do it in a better way, perhaps. So the karmic process of reincarnation and gradual preparation is being speeded up? Very much. But it was long time back when Christ came in. Actually nobody told us that Christ has come in India. That's the confusion about.

The way they represented Christ, Christ was not like that. Christ came on this earth. His name is Mahavishnu in the Indian scriptures and He was to come to suck our sins and our karmas. And He's placed in a center called Agnya Chakra, the last center here, sixth, before entering into the, we can say, the Kingdom of God. This center was the most important one where Christ Himself established. And if He is awakened, He sucks in your karmas. This is already promised in all the Indian scriptures. They were waiting for this Mahavishnu to come. But the missionaries who went with the guns in the one hand and the Bible in the other, they never understood Christ. You see, I don't know what they were talking.

And the way they talked about Christ, nobody could believe that it was Mahavishnu. But now when I told them it was Mahavishnu, they are all changed. Of course, that was Christ and He was Mahavishnu. He's already come, so you don't have to suffer. There is nothing like karmas. In Sahaja Yoga, if you can raise your Kundalini up to that and if Christ is awakened, He'll suck it for you. He's done it already. He's died for us, for this purpose only. It's a special type of a very special incarnation of the Divine vibrations itself. I mean, He is an abstract God who came on this earth.

Tremendous personality it was created. He's all written down. Were you, what was your spiritual training as a young woman? What was your family background and when did you feel it? When did you experience that there may have been something special given to you spiritually? Oh, I am very ancient, you know, so I knew all about it since My birth. Since babyhood you had a feeling. Yes, I was quite, I mean, I knew all these things very well. Was there a particular time that it became active in you? Was there an experience of being called to your mission?

You see, I took birth in a Christian family and My father was a very learned man. He knew 14 languages in Sanskrit and all that he knew. My mother was another very learned lady. And they were very dharmic, you can call them, very religious and good people. And when I was born My father himself told Me that you have to find out an en masse media, a media by which you can give realization to masses. Because if you start talking about God or doing anything like that, you'll form another Bible or thing like that, people may crucify you or do something like that. So if it becomes a mass thing, which I knew I was to do, but he also realized it, then only the solution is there. So you work it out in such a way that you enter in a subtle way into the human beings and try to find out what are their problems and permutations and combinations of their problems and how one can overcome it and how the Kundalini can work out in a mass way. So I worked it out. I went to all these fake gurus and all these masters, so called, to find out what do they do and how they work it out.

I worked very hard. And then they came when I thought, now this is the time. So at what point in your life did you actually begin teaching, taking students or actually transmitting spiritual energy? Actually in 1970, on the 5th of May, this Sahasrara, the last, you can say, the opening took place. And after that I started. But I had only one disciple for some days. Like that, gradually it moved on. I could tell that You were speaking in Christian terms, in an unusual way. I could sense that You weren't speaking just as an ordinary Hindu. I mean, it's interesting that You were born in a Christian family.

Of course. The, the, the, the... I am Hindu, Christian, everything. And You, You, You, You referred to Mohammed Sahib, I think, too. Yes, I was with him also, what to do. I was with all of them. So in, in, in previous lifetimes You, You, You... You know, with all of them. Yes, yes, with all of them, you see. I've, I've witnessed all that. That's how I'm such an expert on human beings, I think.

The, the thing which, which I find remarkable about, about the way You're transmitting spiritual energy is that You, or the awakening of spiritual energy is that Your, Your students tell Me that, that they also become able to, to awaken the spiritual energy of another person. That should be the criteria for everyone, isn't it? If you do not get anything out of your, your guru, what's the use of having such a guru there, who just takes your money, does no work for you and gives you nothing? So what's the use of giving all the time? You must get some return. But, in the past great teachers have, have had only a few disciples who were strong enough to, to also awaken the spiritual energy of other people. It was enough, it was enough for them just to be able to, to transform themselves, where it takes great strength not only to transform yourself, but to, to be, become a, an ocean liner for other people to, to, to cross over the ocean. But that is always in nature also. If you see there's only one flower on a tree, then there are sometimes two, then there are ten, then there is a blossom time. You see the time is such, at this time I've come, and maybe something about Me also, which one should discover after Realization, isn't it?

Are Your Mother and Father still living? No, they are no more now. I myself sixty years of age. You look so young, I'm really... That's a camouflage. My daughter is thirty-four now, elder daughter, and I have grandchildren. I, when we were in India recently, we were fortunate enough to meet with Anandamayi Ma, and I just heard that she passed away a couple of months ago. Hmm. What good did she do? You see, what I'm saying you should see to these people. She actually got hold of all the bureaucrats of India.

I must tell you the facts as they are. And the bureaucrats, all those, recently I had one, her disciple who was a patient of angina, high blood pressure. I mean, one can't understand that with the spiritual life, how can you have high blood pressure? It cannot go hand in hand. A person who is a realized soul must have a low blood pressure, a peaceful personality, isn't it? This is how all her disciples come to Me, with some trouble, mostly with kidney troubles, with heart troubles. I can't understand, she couldn't even look after their health. What was she doing? At least the health of your children should be all right, isn't it? You call yourself Ma.

What do you do as Ma is a Mother. At least look after your health. If a Mother can't look after the health of children, I think she's good for nothing. Are there any spiritual masters in India today that you respect, that you feel are? Oh, there are many, many of them. Many of them they come and see Me, but they live in the hideings, I should call that. There are many. I asked one of them to come here. He ran away in three days from New York, believe Me. Really, it was too much for him.

He said, I don't know Mother, how are you there? He said, after twelve years you tell Me to go there, not now. He couldn't come, he couldn't stay here. He said, they don't understand spirituality, they only understand dollars. So it's impossible for him. They have no patience. One thing I've seen, they have no patience with human beings. They are cut off perhaps, too much. But they are true, they are true, it's no doubt. They are not in the market.

They have suffered, one of them suffered so much. His legs were paralysed, his hands were broken. And he does not know how to go about, so he has one tiger. On the tiger he writes, because he says, it's better to be on the tiger, so at least human beings are afraid of the tiger. We have many. Since you are a master of Kundalini, I would be interested to know what you are feeling about Shri Ramakrishna and Saharada Devi. He was a kind of a spontaneous master of Kundalini. Who Ramakrishna Parvansi? Not at all. Where was he?

He gave Realization to no one, did he? He never gave any Realization to anyone. How was he master of Kundalini? He just played about with everything. You just listen to him, what he says. I will say Ramana Maharshi was, because he talked of the Self. But when did he? Ramakrishna was never. He was always in separation. A person who is in separation is not a Realized soul.

It's a simple test. Anybody who thinks, Oh God, when will you meet Me? That means he is not a Realized soul. Supposing I'm in New York, I'm not going to say, when are we, am I reaching New York? If I'm in New York, I'm in New York. You see, you must use your brains in judging all the gurus. Ramakrishna, I would not call him, he was a devotee of Devi, is all right. That was all right. But he was not Realized soul. If he was a Realized soul, why was he crying and weeping and shouting and dancing?

Mataji, thank you very much. I'm very honored to talk to you, but I think we should go. They are enamored by Ramakrishna now. What to do? What has Ramakrishna given to anyone? Just look at that. In all respect and love, this is the God. No, my child, you must understand, the people of Ramakrishna are suffering from cancer today. He suffered from cancer himself. This is the trouble with these people.

It's better you are on the tape. Just tell me. Now what has Ramakrishna, he himself suffered from cancer. Now I cannot tell them the truth. And Ramakrishna, master of Kundalini, whom did he give Realization? Why are they so false? They are not honest people. Now what have I to tell them? Should I tell them the truth or not? You tell them.

It has to be the truth. This is it! You see they don't want to face the truth. They are dishonest. I mean Ramakrishna has done no good, their people are suffering from cancer today. They are identified. You tell him, you tell him that I was there and why did you, you see they were all sick people. All left sided they have got cancers. What are they doing, why don't they understand these people? They are taking part, he's all right, he was a follower of God, he's all right.

I didn't say anything against but he was not a realized soul, definitely he was crying. It's a fact, I mean you read it, he looks like a sick man himself, he died of cancer. Let it be now what to do. I mean it's impossible with these people, they are dishonest, they are dishonest people. But you can publish it Mother. In this case he may walk out but you can publish it, a magazine will publish everything you said and be very glad to have the article because people will read what they cannot stand the minute they get the impact of it but they will read it. And it will sink in and prepare the way by the written word. This is a fact, what I told you is a fact. You can read him, he's just trying all the time, where is my Mother, where is my Mother. What is there to follow a man who is not in realization?

How can I support a wrong thing? What does it, it's nice to say good things about people to get them more into it but he cannot say this about Ram Krishna because people are suffering too much. They are sick, all of them are sick people, you go and see them because there are doctors, they want the doctors to prosper so they have to create sick people. If he had waited I would have told him, he should go and see what's happening to the Ram Krishna people. And first thing they get is cancer of the throat. He just walked off, see, he couldn't bear it. There are many who want to know the truth. All right, doesn't matter. So what is he, he was going to give it on the TV or something? Radio.

Oh, it's all right because he's frightening. He should see. He will not now, he doesn't want to have it. There is a very strong attachment and feeling for the people that were a part of that particular lineage and he's done, he's invested a great deal of devotion in the direction of that activity. In where? Shri Ram Krishna and other people have come after him. That's it, he must understand he was not a realized soul, you see. Give him a bad man, let him realize it. He was not a realized soul, you see, because people are sick. Actually Mother, I was... You should have told Me about it.

When I first met him, it was a couple of years ago, he looked like a fellow in his early twenties. He looked like a fellow in his early twenties when I met him just a couple of years ago and I was amazed to see him. He's looked at him? He looks sick? I couldn't believe that he changed so. I don't know how old he is but he looked... Imagine he said, I look so young. What about Ram Krishna himself? He used to look an haggard old dying man. This is the way they are identified. They are not honest, they should be honest.

That's the main thing. They are not honest people. You see, the strength is honesty. If you don't have that strength within you, of honesty, you cannot stand the truth. That's the point is. You may telephone and tell him this, that you see there's nothing to be so upset about it because what Mother says is true. We have patience from him. Mother is curing them, she has to cure. He's not coming down here to cure people. Himself is sick.

I didn't say anything. I mean if you can again say what is going on, just say. What did I say exactly about Ram Krishna? Let's re-see it. It's nothing bad. I didn't say he's a bad man or anything but he was not a realized soul, it was a fact. They have deified him. They have deified him in a way. They follow him. A person who is a realized soul must have a low blood pressure, a peaceful personality.

Isn't it? This is how all her disciples come to Me with some trouble, mostly with kidney troubles, with heart troubles. I can't understand. She couldn't even look after their health. What does she do? At least the health of your children should be all right, isn't it? You call yourself Ma. What you do as Ma is a Mother. At least look after your health. If your Mother can't look after the health of children, I think it's good for nothing.

Is it? Is it? Are there any, are there any spiritual masters in India today that you respect, that you feel are? Oh, there are many, many of them. Many of them they come and see Me but they live in the high books, I should call that. They have many. I asked one of them to come here, he ran away. He, it was so much fun. He said, I don't know Mother, how are you there? He said, after twelve years you tell Me to go there, not now.

He couldn't come, he couldn't stay here. He said, they don't understand. The spirituality they only understand dollars. It's impossible for him. They have no patience. One thing I've seen, they have no patience with human beings. They have got all their hands. But they are true, they are true, they are not in the market. They have suffered, one of them suffered so much. His legs were paralyzed, his hands were broken and he does not know how to go about so he has one tiger.

On the tiger he likes. Because he says, it's better to be on the tiger so at least human beings are afraid of the tiger. There are many. Since you are a master of Kundalini, I would be interested to know if you were feeling about Shri Ramakrishna and Saharada Devi. Shri Ramakrishna was a kind of a spontaneous master of Kundalini. Who Ramakrishna Paramahansa? Not at all, very much. He gave Realization to [? ], did he? He never gave any Realization to anyone.

How was he master of Kundalini? He just played about with everything. You just listen to him, what he says. I will say Ramana Maharshi was because he talked of the Self. But when did he? Ramakrishna was never. He was always in separation. A person who is in separation is not Realized. So it's a simple test. Anybody who thinks, oh God, when will you meet Me?

That means he is not a Realized soul. Supposing I am in New York, I am not going to say, when are we, am I reaching New York? If I am in New York, I am in New York. You see you must use your brains in judging all the gurus. Ramakrishna, I would not call him, he was a devotee of Devi, he is alright. That was alright. But he was not Realized soul. If he was a Realized soul, why was he crying and weeping and shouting and all that? I said thank you very much. I am very honored to talk to you with you.

What did he say? I am honored to have spoke to you but we have to go. He is afraid. And he left at 10.47. 10.40 I think. Mother, when you have time, I have an interview all written. When you have time, I have an interview all written. We put it on a tape and we use it in the radio station in Boston. Is it? It's all done and if they can tape it for Me, then I have the answers on the tape.

Alright, you would like to send this one or you would like to have another one? Perhaps both. Can they can the radio? You ask Me other questions, I think. Yes, I have My own questions. Yes, questions would be better. When should we do? You don't want to take a tape out of that. I can do it now, if you want to do it now, if you want to rest, I can do it later. No, why not have a tape?

If you have to send it to Boston, then you have a tape ready. And they get them to come down and I said I would call them as soon as you came and we know how much time you had. Alright, we can do it now. It's good, you have more time to. I thought it was a wonderful interview. I don't understand if it is so fair. No, no, no, no, you see, he was trying to aiming at that, you see. But no, he came with that purpose. His void was horrid, his stomach was wobbling, completely wobbling, poor fellow was nervous, he couldn't look at Me. And left, left the machine and left to understand.

It's a fact, you know, whatever I am saying, you see, if the disciples are so very sick, he himself is sick, that woman is sick, when he'll get troubles he'll come to Me, I know. You see, the problem of it is that there are these people that have the ear of the public are targets. You see, major targets and they are attacked regularly, you see, and what they think is spirituality is really something that is just invading them. Is what? It's allities? What they think is spirituality, what they think is real, is just something that's invading them in order to get the ear of the public, in order to get the attention of the public. He has a very large listening audience and so this, which is the mecca for the bhoots, you know, in this world but this country in particular, perhaps, his particular program is one voice that I would think the bhoots in the area would want to have silenced or at least under their control. There are He got upset when I said I was Christian, I tell you, because what Ramakrishna was, he was against Christians and specially Vivekananda was very much against Christianity and Christians and you know, just to outwit them he started this missionary work. You see, in the Hindu religion there is nothing like missionary work, is called as the worst of all, is the menial work. You see, he is not certain Brahmins, you see, this missionary work because the first concept is wrong that somebody is the other who to emancipate you are, you, if you are the Spirit then you don't have to help anybody, it is just you are part and parcel that you are helping, you see, so the whole idea is regarded as Shubra, is regarded as low, this is menial according to Indian philosophy, you see, and that's exactly started just like all the, if he had said here I would have told him all about it.

He started this idea, this, what's his name, Ramakrishna of the missionary work but the one who really gave it a shape was his disciple Vivekananda. He started missionary things and hospitals and this and that, all kinds of things, you know, horrible people. They are extremely money minded, extremely gregarious, all kinds of problems they have. There's no transformation, nothing. Whom did he transform? I mean you must face it. This is the point. Now if this person, he got upset because I said I was born in a Christian family, I can tell you. They couldn't take it. They are against Christ.

All of them are against Christ. They don't believe in Christianity as Christ, this thing, take it from Me. This is the reason. Is it a government radio he is operating? No, it's a listener sponsored radio. Is owned? A listener sponsored, he works on the station, it's called WBAI. Who owns them? The, it's owned by the people that's, that's supported. By the same people?

By the public. By the public? It's publicly maintained. Is the public? Yes, the public sends money in. The government gives a very, very small part if anything now. Oh, sorry, the public is doing it? The public, yes. Now the, means a private man must be doing somebody who must have put in the money, must have started? No, actually they depend almost entirely on public contributions.

But they have different managers. You see, then you can write to them that this man is a follower of Ram Krishna who was against Christianity, who was against Christ and that's why when Mother said it, he was upset. Why not write to them? You see, he must be having bosses also. He has free hand in what kind of program? Whatever it is but you can point it out that he's biased, he's not open minded. If he's doing public work. Not in that sense, not in that sense. He has a strong support for Christianity and mainline Christianity as far as that's concerned. He's had several purely Christian figures, Catholic figures as well as general Christians.

Then why was he only because of Ram Krishna being criticized? Yes. So that means he cannot be a biased person. You see, in a democratic country you should give chance to everyone. He should have discussed instead of giving. In his mind Ram Krishna is synonymous with a perfect incarnation of God. All right, whatever it is but you can't use your mind for a public work. You see, you must give chance to everyone under a democratic country. It must be pointed out to the public somehow. You cannot, I mean he cannot propagate Ram Krishna.

He cannot put his ideas into my head. I mean he is a public servant. You both have equal rights. In that situation you both have equal rights. Equal rights, he's a public man. If he's a public servant, he has no business. I think it should be pointed out to someone there, up there. He's above you. Who brought him here? You.

I did not, I'm sorry. I didn't realize. When did he meet you? I never did. I just knew that he ran a radio program for seekers so I called him up and asked him if he wanted to come interview you and he said yes. So you should go and see his, his superiors and you should see he's got, he's having a thing for seekers. He is a person who doesn't take any money, has done so much good and she's saying something same and this fellow just left. Is this the man who's doing good to, why not go see his superiors? He's acting as a censor. Huh?

He's censoring you. He's censoring a public. Was he? He's censoring you. He's acting as a censor. Cutting people off from part of the truth. Yes. His own president. He's not censoring. Yes, that's the point.

He's censoring. He can't just do it. You see, you should, you should all write. Yes. You are all citizens of this country. You can all write. We have a big group of them in Boston and they are all sick. They have kidney troubles, they have hypoglycemia, they have almost every disease. You should write. You see, why not say, why not write that I was present at the, thank God you were all here and Mother was, never said anything against him but she said she, he was not a realized soul and Mother has a right to say that and he just walked off.

How can he do it? It's better. To pursue the matter. To bring him down. You see, he may believe into anything. You may believe into ghosts. So what? Everybody has a right to say what they want. This is a free country or it's a, what sort of a country is this? If we had someone to introduce Mother, it would, it's the table.

All right. Which? I'll have some water. But. Well, that's for the other end of the year. Yes, because it's a free country. But someone to introduce Mother. But he would be sitting here? All right? No, you sit here, because he will have to go away, won't he?

After introducing. But he can sit there, just. What did you like about the way the introduction? He's looking rather worried now. He gets very angry, isn't he? You, because he's a journalist, that's why. You see why he's angry? Because his clan has mis-piailed. But they are all like that. I must tell you, horrible people.

I mean he's a journalist, he's a public man. He has no business to have his own opinion. You see, very bad journalism. You better get a letter from him. Very bad journalism. You cannot be biased, you have to be a witness. That means he's trying to attract every one of them to his clan. If you are upset, let us some say something. You better introduce. He's looking so upset of this place.

This journalist. I thought it was good to see, they're so afraid. They're so afraid when they hear the truth, because that's the reaction we've gotten in Boston. They're afraid when they hear the truth, especially about the false gurus. That's it. My, On the floor, on the right hand side, at the door. I'll give you the introduction and you can just add anything you like to it. It seems Mother this is not, this is typical in the sense that the usual outlets, the usual newspapers and so on, are really primarily interested in those areas of power and money. That is really what So that I can understand. That I can understand.

That is the area that I think we've got to move into. No, no, that I can understand, but I can't understand this. That's what I can say. This is the other, where You see, you cannot, you cannot have your own ideas and your own identifications so much that you cannot bear anything else. It seems that people are are placed, these sort of people who have an interest They are, they are biased. They are a placed and They are placed and then of course the bias What you call them? A vested interest. Yes, yes. Wested interest, you see. Wested interest is the word.

Mother, I don't want that. He left it by watch. I think he left it by watch. He left it, he took your watch. He was holding a hand. I hope he'll return it. He'll return, no doubt, but good, your watch has gone with him. It will do some good to him. He didn't even have a watch with himself. What sort of an interviewer he is?

Now so, would you introduce? No, no, I would say that is he going to come in the film or not? Just now he is very upset and angry. No, no, I don't think it's just sound. It's sound, is it? Because if they like this then they can come down tomorrow and do it themselves with their own television. No, no, no. Now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, please, please, please avoid sound. I'll have some water please. Unless you are... Little warm.

...it is fine. It's all right, it's all right. It's the water here, thank you, thank you very much, thank you, thank you.
