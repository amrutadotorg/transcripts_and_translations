My personal health is a miracle, at least I think it is. I had been getting ill gradually, without really knowing why, for quite a long time, and no doctor seemed to be able to come to any conclusion about it.

One night, I had a dream. I'm a nurse by training, and 40 years earlier I had nursed a lady who, I have to say, I hadn't thought about since then. I dreamt of this woman, and I saw her walking down the ward towards me. I knew that that was what I had—that was my illness.

I woke up the next morning and went to my GP. What I had was a tumor in my pituitary, which manifests in a particular way in your body shape and all the rest of it. It's something that doctors are all told about, but it's so rare that they never see it; they forget about it. So I went to my GP and said to him, "I think somebody ought to have a look at my pituitary or my adrenals." He looked at me and said, "Oh my goodness, how could we have missed it?" and sent me off to them.

So I went on my path, and Mother cured me—I mean, with doctors. But if it hadn't been for that dream, I probably wouldn't be here now. So, that was my personal health miracle.

Thank you.
