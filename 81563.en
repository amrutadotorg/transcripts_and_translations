 (England)

Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you very much for coming to this Golden Memories, the first session. We welcome you. We're very, very grateful that you've made it. We want to start this session by a recollection of the very beginning, of where you were when you started seeking. How did you happen to find Shri Mataji in the very first days? So would Ruth like to start, please?

Yes. Yes, I was seeking in quite an intense way. I was reading about all different kinds of religions, and I'd say I was a pretty desperate seeker. I was a very bad insomniac; I hadn't slept very much for two years. I was so tense, I think.

Basically, I moved into a house in Bristol where my husband-to-be was living in the flat above. I didn't know him then. He'd been telling all his friends about Sahaja Yoga and expecting them to be as enthusiastic as he was, and of course, hadn't had much response. When he came to telling me about it, he was very laid back and didn't tell me very much. He didn't show me Shri Mataji's photograph, but he described that it was something within us through which we could feel our own inner state, and also that it was collective and we could feel the state of other people. And not only that, but that we could actually put that right. I remember thinking, "Well, what else is there?" If that's true, then that's it.

He told me about the meetings in London at Caxton Hall, where Shri Mataji was. I didn't tell him because I wanted to go to the meeting on my own. I didn't want to have that feeling that he was watching me and seeing what my response would be. So I went without telling him. I had a very intense, deep experience at that first meeting with Shri Mataji, and just went back and said, "I've met Shri Mataji, and I'm going to do it." And he nearly went through the ceiling, because he was so surprised that everybody else he'd been telling had not had that kind of reaction. But I was seeking very much.

Interviewer: What was it like when you met Shri Mataji? You said you had a very intense experience.

Ruth: I remember sitting, waiting for Shri Mataji to come into the hall. And it was only then, really, that I started to think, "What is it? Who is this person that I'm waiting to see?" And this intense feeling of expectation. Suddenly, everybody rose to their feet, and Mother walked in. I remember she was much smaller than I expected because I suppose I imagined someone much bigger. And I was right in the front row.

Shri Mataji talked for about an hour, I suppose, quite a long talk. And I just remember feeling that everything that she said made such sense. It was such common sense and just resonated so much in me. Then at the end of her talk, she said, "Right now, it's not about talking. It's about the experience."

As soon as I did that, I felt this incredible thump, thump, thump up my spine. I didn't really know very much about Kundalini or anything, so I didn't know what to expect. I just knew something amazing had happened because, obviously, it was a very definite experience.

She was in an incredibly motherly mood that night, which was very good for me because I had quite a difficult relationship with my own mother. She was just pouring love out, with her arms open and moving amongst everybody. It was very biblical in a way. I remember feeling—she didn't talk to me—but I remember having this feeling that I just wanted to touch any part of her, like even her sari. Afterwards, I thought, "Gosh, I've never had that feeling about anybody before." And I recognized that as something very special, that I had that instinct. And just that feeling, a feeling that I'd never seen love like that before. I knew that I was seeing some love which was just beyond, just special.

Interviewer: Bernard, would you like to share your experience?

Bernard: Yeah, well, my seeking was quite developed before I came. I won't go all the way back because it's a very long story. But basically, I'd had a musical experience. I'd bought a saxophone. And two weeks after I'd bought it, I was trying to play along with a jazz record and I was trying to get the mode of the music that was on the record. I was trying to feel my way into it, and suddenly, something kicked in. Suddenly, I was playing. It was complete freedom. I was flying all over the place, playing precisely all the notes that I ever dreamt of playing. It was just a completely liberating experience.

The next evening, I thought, "I've cracked it. I know how to play now." I picked up my saxophone, and it just wasn't there. That evening had completely gone. So I thought, "Now, what happened there? Something amazing happened there. And how can I get it back?" I had this experience two or three times, sometimes playing with other people, which was an incredible experience as well because you seem to enter an area where, without saying anything to the other person, you were on each other's wavelength. And it was very tight. I could see this happening as well in other great performances of music. Subsequently, I've learned all art comes from that space, was highly spontaneous, and it came from somewhere within. I read books where musicians were saying, "I become my instrument, and my instrument becomes me, no longer human." And one jazz musician was saying, "This music is coming directly to you from the creator."

So I knew there was something that I wanted to find. I was looking into the coolness of the whole jazz thing, the whole cool side of jazz, being relaxed in command of the situation. That led me to, "Well, how do you become relaxed?" And in that way, I started looking at meditation. I was reading books on meditation. At that time, I was reading different scriptures as well. For some reason, I started reading all different scriptures and realizing that they were all saying the same thing. All the virtues these great people were talking about—the Buddhists, Muhammad, Lao Tzu—they're all saying the same thing. No one else could see that.

At the same time, I'd moved out of London and into the countryside, and I was becoming more and more of a recluse because I was feeling that no one really was on that wavelength and wondering what it was all about. Then some friends of mine came down for the weekend, and they had in tow with them a Sahaja Yogi. We went down the pub, and the first noticeable thing was that this guy wasn't drinking. I said, "Oh, why aren't you drinking?" And he said, "Oh, it's my meditation, man. If you meditate properly, you don't need to drink." I thought, "Oh, this sounds interesting," because I'd already come to the conclusion that maybe these habits weren't good for one.

And then I said, "Well, why not?" He said, "Well, it's the Kundalini. It affects the Kundalini." I said, "Well, what's the Kundalini?" He said, "I can't tell you." I said, "Well, is it the Tao?" because the first stanza in the Tao Te Ching is "the Tao that is spoken is not the sacred Tao." And he said, "Well, I don't know. I don't know what the Tao Te Ching is." But we know now that the Tao is the same as Kundalini. He said, "Oh, it's this Indian lady behind it. Here, go and listen to this tape." He didn't come into the room with me; he just sent me into another room. I listened to the tape, and I suppose I felt very meditative while I was listening to it. And then afterwards, he didn't say anything more about Sahaja Yoga.

Interviewer: What was on the tape?

Bernard: The funny thing about what was on the tape was that Shri Mataji was actually talking about it being now the time that the sages and seers come down from the mountains and out of the woods and back into the cities because we were needed there. I thought, "Oh, no, I've just moved out of London."

Interviewer: Which year was this?

Bernard: This was 1980. I met Shri Mataji for the first time precisely 30 years ago last Wednesday.

Interviewer: Oh, fantastic. What was it like when you met her?

Bernard: Well, because I'd taken quite a few drugs, I suppose I was expecting something a little bit more cosmic than I actually got on the evening. I was expecting a lot of fireworks. It wasn't like that at all. Sahaja Yoga is never what you expect it to be. It was very serene, very subtle. I can't say I felt vibrations. I felt sensations in my back. I felt a lot of love from the yogis and from Shri Mataji herself. Something happened, but I couldn't put my finger on what. Yeah, and I felt it in my heart, yes, that something had happened.

Interviewer: Thanks, Bernard. Matthew, your mum was already in Sahaj, was she, when you got to know Shri Mataji?

Matthew: Absolutely, yeah. I think my experience is going to be slightly different from everybody else's here, being that I was about 10 years old, 31 years ago now. There are two sides to it for me. One was obviously seeing the difference in my mum from the things that she'd been looking for, the routes that she'd been searching through before, which were on the same lines as Bernard—sort of drinking, drugs, and a few other bits and bobs. But the day that she found Sahaja Yoga, she completely changed. And I think me and my brother both noticed that this was something.

Interviewer: As a 10-year-old?

Matthew: Even as a 10-year-old, I remember.

Interviewer: What were the thoughts? What were your observations as a child? We'd like to know.

Matthew: I think just the fact that she was a bit more loving towards us. There was a lot more love in the house. Some of the friends that she maybe associated with before who weren't maybe so nice, they were all gone and we were surrounded by Sahaja Yogis. So that was an amazing, amazing thing.

Things were slightly different then than they are now. The programmes that we were taken to, sometimes against our will probably, there were seven-hour pujas that we had to sit through and a thousand and one names. For an 11-year-old and a 12-year-old, it was sometimes a little bit boring. I remember being jealous of my brother once because he had a digital stopwatch to play with, and I had nothing.

Interviewer: As a 10-year-old, what was it like when you first met Shri Mataji?

Matthew: It's weird because I'm trying to remember. We were taken to, I remember Caxton Hall as well. And I think then we were probably just at the back of the hall trying to stay out of the way. But I have recollections of Mother's first trip to Brighton, which was a train trip down to Brighton. My mum going to the station, late I think as usual, in an old Vauxhall Viva, picking Mother up and bringing her to our house. So I think there were pujas in the front room downstairs. I slept in my mum's bed.

Interviewer: Did you have, in all this time when Mother visited your home, did you spend any time with Mother as a child? Did she talk to you, play with you?

Matthew: Yeah, yeah. I remember seeing pictures. I don't think there was the fear. As a 10-year-old, Mother was the center of attention. So for me, I would just weave my way through the front and stand next to Mother. As Mother was getting in the car, I remember standing at the door as it was opened.

I also remember one time—I spent a lot of my youth in Brighton on the amusements—I remember when Mother was down there with her daughter and her grandchild, Anand, asking them if they could come down to the seafront and go to the amusement arcade. There are some pictures that I've seen of when we were down there. So everybody went, a big group of us went down to the amusements. And I know I've seen pictures of Mother and her daughter looking at Anand playing a computer game.

So it was just like an extended family. It was like a grandmother coming to stay. So it was a lot different. There was no real fear. We just wanted to get up and be close to Mother whenever we could. I remember that feeling when I went to India with Mother, because on the first tour, we were in Nagpur and there was a music programme. Somehow I always seem to end up sitting next to Mother at music programmes. Even in Russia, many years later, when there was a room with thousands of people in it, somehow I ended up at Mother's feet in this huge hall.

But when we were in India, it's the first time I met Baba Mama as well. It was just an incredible evening's music. And at one point I turned to Mother and said, "Mother, it's just like one big family." Mother got up and said, "One big happy family."

Interviewer: Vinakshi, what was your experience like? Were you seeking, were you looking for God when you got your realization?

Vinakshi: When I came to Sahaja Yoga, it was actually because of my father. He was really seeking a lot. I was only a child, so I didn't know much about it.

Interviewer: Where were you?

Vinakshi: I was in Bombay, in Mumbai. It's called Mumbai now. I was going for my exams, actually. The next day were my exams, and my father said, "No." He had got his realization just the day before. So that was 1972. Actually, my father's story was, his best friend said to him, "I want something that I don't have to depend on a guru." Like, normally gurus in India, they either take money or they have some sort of thing which they can't give to the disciples. And that was a very innate thing that my father really was expecting. And being a child, I didn't know much about it, but I heard him saying that to his friend. I still remember that. He said, "It's nice to have something that I can stand on my feet and I can do something."

And his friend said, "Oh, really, I know a lady they call Shri Mataji. Why don't I take you there?" And then he went there, and he came home and said, "I've got this realization." And the next day was an exam. He said, "Let's go." Then he took all the family, my mother and my brother as well. And we got our realization there. And that's it, really.

Interviewer: What was it like? How old were you when you met Mother?

Vinakshi: About 17, because in 1972, I was 17 years old.

Interviewer: How did you feel when you saw Shri Mataji?

Vinakshi: We had been to Mother's house, actually, in Jivanjot, I think. There were actually very few people, maybe 10, 15, or at the most 20 people. And Mother was sitting there. She just asked us to close our eyes and just sit. Being a small child, you just sit, you just do what you have been asked to. And then of course, slowly, gradually you meditate. But that time you don't know much about chakras and things like that. You go along with your parents.

As a child, I was a little nervous. I was not a brilliant student as such, so I was a little nervous about my studies and my exams. In India, mostly we go to gurus and say, "Oh, can I have your blessings?" It's quite common to say that. I don't know, I used to tell Mother, "Oh, can you put your hand on my head?" Because like Matthew said, Mother was just so informal. It was nothing like that; she was really like a mother. And I’d ask, "Can you put your hand on my head so that my exams go alright?" And she used to put her hand on and say, "Yes, don't worry."

On one occasion, I said, "Oh, I've got my SSC exams," which is called GCSE in this generation. And I got an opportunity to give a ring to Mother, actually. I rang Mother up and I said, "I've got my exams. I would just like your blessings." And Mother said, "Oh, that's fine. Don't worry." And that's it.

Also, there was one occasion where Shri Mataji, in those days, used to come to all the meetings, like we have over here now, local meetings. She used to attend quite a few meetings, maybe two meetings or three meetings a week. She used to travel and then sit late till about 11 or 12 o'clock at night, working on people. There used to be two rows of people, and they used to go to Mother's feet. What used to happen during those days is Mother used to just sit like this, and people used to go and we could put our hands under her feet and take the vibrations, like really doing namaskar. It was a lovely experience. You could feel the vibrations coming from the feet of Mother when you put your hand underneath her. We were so fortunate to have that experience during that time, which people now won't even know about.

Then Mother used to say, "Oh, come on." And there used to be Sahaja Yogis standing on both sides, and Mother used to clear the chakras. And I've seen Kundalini. When people used to go to Mother's feet, I have seen Kundalini rising. The Kundalini of a person who is on Mother's feet. And supposing if a chakra got caught up, you could see the throbbing of the Kundalini on that chakra. Mother used to clear it out, and then it used to come along to the Sahasrara because that person used to be on Mother's feet. So we could see the Kundalini rising. And that was a really unforgettable experience which, of course, people now won't even think would happen. Then we used to take the bus and go home, but we used to experience all this sort of thing.

Even just last year, I went back to Bombay. And I said, "Let me go to see this Bharte Vidyabhon," which Mother used to go to. The stage was still there where Mother was sitting. And I said, "Oh my God, the stage is still there." So, it's beautiful. It was a lovely experience.

Interviewer: Brenda and Rupert, you were married when you first met Shri Mataji.

Brenda: Yeah, but our experience is completely different. It was intertwined, but different. Let Rupert tell you the beginning.

Rupert: Well, it was pure accident, because I was trying to improve my martial arts. I was involved in the martial arts, you see, and you're trying to achieve this state of moksha, the Japanese style. And we weren't getting anywhere. A friend of mine had been to Mother's meetings, but he didn't tell me about this. He couldn't make Shri Mataji out, so he gave me this tape. He said, "What do you think of that?" You know, asking for my opinion. So I sat in the garden one August afternoon and put this tape on. Mother's voice, it was just sounding so pure to me. I called Brenda out. I said, "Come and listen to this lady's voice. 100% pure." I don't know why I was sounding it, because what she was saying didn't make any sense to me. But I just knew that this lady had something. I felt something here, but nowhere else. Couldn't make any sense of it.

To cut a long story short, I went and phoned my friend up and said, "Where did you get this tape from?" "Well, I've been going to Caxton Hall, and she goes there. But she's coming to my home. She's going to a meeting in the East End of London, and she's coming to my house before the meeting. So if you want to come over, you can meet her there."

So, me and Brenda, we go over to this place. As we turn into the street—a crammed road in Barking—there are all these strange people outside his house. It's a hot summer day, and they've all got scarves on. I thought, "This is a bit strange." He had this big wooden Buddha, and they're taking it out and putting it in his garden. I said, "What are they doing to your Buddha, John?" He says, "It's got bhoots." So, it's got to go into the garden. I said, "What do you mean, it's got bhoots?" He said, "Well, they'll tell you." So I said to this young fella, "You cold, mate?" "No," he said, "I'm protecting my Vishuddhi." Well, I didn't know what he was talking about.

So, we had a general chat. Then we heard—we were in the garden talking to these people, and I had some of my students with me, who I used to teach, because we thought we were going to get this Moksha to improve our martial arts. Someone shouted, "Jai Shri Mataji," and we were in the garden.

Brenda: Mother came into the room.

Rupert: Brenda had an experience before that. But as far as I was concerned, Mother came into the room, and we all followed her in. It was almost where you're sitting now. She sat down like this, and this young Sahaja Yogini came along and went to her feet. As this girl, Cathy, went to her feet, we saw the Kundalini go up her back. And Mother said, "Ah, do you see the Kundalini? Do you see the Kundalini?" It was a distinct, transparent snake. That's just what it looked like. We were all dumbfounded. I looked at Mother, and she said, "Yeah."

My friend had two sons who, in them days, were skinheads. They didn't like foreigners, if you like, and they weren't going to have any coming into the house. They didn't want any foreigners coming into the house. They’d put their boots on everything. But when we looked around, they'd both arrived. They'd come out of the garden, their boots were off. No one told them to do this. But what we saw, no one could dispute what we'd seen.

His wife had just left him, my friend, and he had five children. Mother said, "Are these your children?" to Brenda, to my wife. She said, "No, no, they're not my children, Mother." So she said, "Well, where are your children?" So Brenda said, "They're at home." "Bring them to the meeting tonight."

So we shot home and got the kids and went back that evening and sat in front of Mother. All my lads were there as well. Mother was saying to each of them, "You're very right-sided. What are you doing?" And they were saying, "Martial arts." "Oh," you know, sort of. By the time she got to me, I felt really guilty. I thought, "What are these folks? It's all my fault." When she worked on me, it just felt like an ice cream cone.

Then someone said, "Can you say the Lord's Prayer?" I said, "Well, I don't know it." So they said it for me. And they said, "Can you feel the cool breeze?" I could feel this up here now. I thought, "It's a window open somewhere." Mother said, "Can you feel it?" I said, "Yeah." But it didn't make any sense to me. It felt very good, but it was all alien, completely alien to me.

She went along to my son, my oldest son. I'd just lost my brother, who had just died, and he was very fond of my oldest son. He used to worry about him. She said to my oldest son, "Ah, there's someone here protecting you. You lost someone recently." And he said, "It's my uncle, and I love him." She said, "Well, you tell him you're okay now, and you'll be fine. You let him go." "I'm not going to let him go." But he did eventually. Some yogis were going to work on the younger two children, and Mother said, "No, no, no, no, no. They're realized. You leave them. Leave them."

Brenda: But my experience was when Rupert was in the garden with his Aiki men, I was at the kitchen door, leaning, sort of half listening inside and half listening outside. I didn't hear the house clear out of yogis, but the next voice I heard was, "Hello." I restrained myself from dashing over and hugging her and kissing her. It was as if my heart did recognize, but the brain doesn't. And I thought, "What are you doing? Control yourself." I walked up, took her hand, and said, "I'm so glad you could come." And she just hugged me. It was such a wonderful experience. You can only relate it to your earthly mother if you've not seen her for years. And suddenly you see her, and you think, "Mum." And you really want to run and hug and kiss them. Well, that's exactly how I felt. But of course, your brain doesn't understand your heart, does it? Everything else that Rupert said is extremely accurate. It was fantastic.

Rupert: Yeah, it was absolutely. For years, I couldn't comprehend what was going on. I didn't believe for about two years that these vibrations were coming from me. I kept saying, "There's a door open somewhere." I couldn't comprehend this cool breeze. And it made a lot of sense to me, because I was brought up in a different culture. People said, "This is Kundalini." But I thought, "Well, okay. So what?" That was my attitude.

Interviewer: You were meditating for these two years, though?

Rupert: Oh, yes. Yeah, we used to. In fact, we had a fantastic experience. This wasn't through me to my mother; this was after I met Mother. I was still sort of taking it a bit tongue-in-cheek. One of these Sahaja Yogis was working on me, and I saw him stretch over and pick up this rose. I thought, "He's going to ask for that in my mouth." This was my attitude. I thought, "Oh, here we go." And he said, "Put it in the palm of your hand." As he put it in the palm of my hand, the top of my head blew off. I've never felt this ever again. For the first time, I wasn't aware of my head; it felt completely open. I could feel myself giggling down here. And I felt fantastic. Even now. It was unbelievable. You can't put it in words. It was fantastic.

Interviewer: Yes. It's an experience you have to experience, isn't it? It's not something that's verbally explained.

Rupert: Yeah. And it certainly comes from the heart. And that's what got me in it. Those two experiences have kept me in it all these years.

Interviewer: Yeah, nice. Nice.

Padmini:

Thank you. It was a Sri Ganesh puja. My sister went to where Mother was staying, and she met Mother and everything. When she came home, she said, "I saw Shri Mataji." And inside my mind, I said, "I must go and see Shri Mataji." The second day, I just said to my mom, "I'm going today to meet Shri Mataji. But don't wake me when I come back home."

At that time, in Pune, there was so much traffic—all the traffic jams and everything. And I went by myself, alone. I said inside, "I want to meet Shri Mataji. And without meeting her, I'll never come back home." I went and got dressed. I went there and said, "I'm not knocking on the door, but I'll just wait outside and pray to Mother inside." Then some foreigner came and opened the door, so I followed him.

I just went to the sitting room. There were Mother's photographs and everything. And inside, I was just saying, "Mataji, please, I want to see you today, to meet you." Another lady came and she said to me, "How long have you...?" This and that, she asked so many questions. I just gave no answer. But she said, "No, it's tomorrow's puja. You can meet her there." This and that. But I didn't say anything. I just stood there, praying inside.

And little Vaishmati, she came there and sat on the sofa. And then Yogi Mahajan was there, and they were offering all this Durva—they call it green things—offering to Sri Ganesha for the puja. And Shri Mataji was chatting with us. It was just so much tremendous joy. She asked him... I think it was in '83 or something. That was a really great experience.

After that, a few years later, Shri Mataji was in Pratishtan. At that time, my sister's marriage was arranged, so I went there to give her the invitation. Mother said, "I can't come," but she said, "I can send some Sahaja Yogis," because there would be so much of a crowd there. I was still very new at that time; I didn't know about it. And then she sent lots of foreigners there. She called my husband—I said John, before he came to the marriage—and she said, "You know, the girl is getting married. Her sister likes him. You can get married to her." So that's the time our marriage was decided. And we got married.

Interviewer: So you went to give Shri Mataji the marriage invitation for your sister, and then you got married. How good is that?

Padmini: And after that, I first went to Italy, and I used to cook for Shri Mataji. One day, Shri Mataji said, "We're going for a picnic." I said, "Okay." Mother's granddaughter likes keema, which is a kind of minced lamb, and she likes some paratha. That day, I was by myself in the kitchen. Mother suddenly came. She said, "Come on, I can show you how to make the keema."

She had me chop a little garlic, ginger, and small onions. She put some oil in the pot and some garam masala—cardamom, cloves, and all these things. Then she put in the ginger and garlic. She didn't use a cloth; she just directly held the pot. I said, "Shri Mataji, please take some cloth," and she said, "No, it's all okay." She was just holding it. And then when she first fried the garlic and onion, she put the keema in. She cooked and so on, and then she just gave me some on her hand. She said, "How does it taste?" And I said, "Oh, it's so nice." Such a tremendous thing.

And I used to go... Mother showed me how to make her bed and everything. Sometimes after she washed her hair, we would dry it with ajwain dhuni. And it was such a tremendous, very gentle process.

Interviewer: How did you feel when you dried her hair?

Padmini: We didn't wash Mother's hair. When Mother washed her hair, we would dry it with the ajwain dhuni. It required being really, really careful because sometimes there would be noise and things. But it was such a tremendous thing. And when Mother showed me how to make the bed, I just watched, because I didn't know how to make a bed in the Western style. And she was just showing me. It was so tremendously joyful. And the keema she made was really beautiful.

Next, my husband used to work in Ealing, so Mother came to Ealing. One day, Subra used to massage Mother's feet. And Mother just sent a message to me, "Call Padmini to massage my other foot." So one side Subra was massaging, and one side I was massaging. Such a tremendous feeling. I really wanted to massage Mother's feet, and that day was such a joyful feeling.

After a little while, I was pregnant at that time. Mother called me again. She used to say that because I was pregnant, I should sit on the chair while I massaged her, so all the vibrations would go into my tummy. Then she used to tell a story. She said, "When I was pregnant, my daddy used to take me for a walk." She said to me that time in Ealing, where we used to live, "Don't go up a high hill. Just go to this level." And with all these things, we used to really laugh. Such wonderful things. I still remember.

Another really good experience: when I got married, my husband stayed for six months in Pratishtan. He was doing some glass cutting and fixing. One day, I couldn't go to Pratishtan, and I suddenly said, "I must phone and tell him." So I phoned, and Subra picked up the phone. And I had a 30-minute conversation with Shri Mataji.

At that time, I was so... I didn't realize. I said, "Shri Mataji, can you give a message to John? I'm not coming to Pratishtan." I didn't realize I was asking God to give a message! And we chatted for 30 minutes, about this and that. When she picked up the phone, I didn't say, "Jai Shri Mataji" or anything, I just spoke to her like a friend. The next day, I went to Pratishtan. I think John and I were walking in, and she came from the other side. I think she came forward and said, "Sorry, John, I didn't tell you. Your wife already phoned me and told me."

It was just such innocence. Sometimes I think, "Shri Mataji, you are really the Adi Shakti," and I'm just talking with her. And now I think about how I talked to Shri Mataji. She is the Adi Shakti. And before I left Cabella, with full hands, full of Lakshmi, she gave me English coins. It was really nice.

Taty:

A long time ago, I was young, and I had the misfortune to find this guru in Hampstead. I went there for about 16 years. I met my best friend there, Magda, who became a Sahaja Yogi. This man was very strict. You weren't allowed... if you weren't already married, you were celibate. You weren't allowed to have any relationships with people. It was like that. In a way, it was helpful because I was an actress, and it did keep me out of a lot of troubles that I could have gotten into. But anyway, I got into quite a bad state.

I'd been going there for 16 years. Then Magda, who lived in Hampstead, said, "Oh, there's a lady yogini coming to give a program. Let's go." I was in such a bad state, so left-sided, that I didn't go. It was on a Saturday. Magda went with her daughter, Dania. I saw them afterwards, and they were full of this lady. "Oh, she's lovely! She's got lots of flowers. She holds the babies. Everybody talks to each other." I said, "It's wonderful." So the next week, I went to Caxton Hall.

Shri Mataji wasn't there. Anyway, they sat me in the front. I sat in front of the photograph, and I had an amazing experience. I just felt everything I feel for my own mother come up in cinemascope. All the emotions that you have about your mother—it was just huge. So I had this idea about Shri Mataji that she was going to be a little lady. "Oh, come, darling, have a cup of tea." Lots of jewelry, flowers, all friendly.

So I went to Caxton Hall the week after. I was sitting right in the front, as near as I am to Brenda. There was Mother's chair, and she came in. She wasn't anything like this little lady covered in flowers saying, "Have a cup of tea, dear." She looked like an opera star. She had the white sari; she swept in. She looked around, you know how she does sometimes? She looks like that. And the first thing she said—I was having a very bad relationship with someone at the time—"In New York, she's wasting her life on this worthless man. She's throwing her life away." And Magda, who was sitting next to me, she went...

Anyway, to say I was awestruck is putting it mildly. Mother looked like the epitome of intelligence. She had the most wonderful skin, like a child. Beautiful. We were sitting right there, and she gave us the flowers to smell. And then she spoke. I don't know what to say. It was just amazing. In those days, she used to get up and work on everyone. When she got to me, she put her hand on my head and she went, "Oh, the clash with the world! The heat!"

I went home. The next week, I still went to this other guru. I'd been going there for so long. And I thought, "Well, this isn't right." A few days later, I went to Caxton Hall again. We took a friend of ours from the other meeting who was very rude to Mother, which was horrible. But at the end, when we all got up, Mother clasped my hands. She said, "Don't worry about anything. All the warmth is there. You're going to be all right." And I was far from all right. After that, I just never looked back. Eventually, I got married in Sahaj, and I became Mother's secretary. I spent lots of time with her. So I can never thank Mother for what she got me out of and how much she's given me.

Interviewer: When was your first meeting with Mother?

Taty: It was 1980. In fact, Bernard's just had his anniversary. Mine's coming up next week, I think. 16th of June, 1980.

Interviewer: That's very nice. Would anyone like to share the funny moments of Shri Mataji? Because it was so informal, those times. There must have been so many.

Taty: Yes, there was one in France... Could I just say something? We were sitting in her bedroom and she looked in the mirror and she said to me, "You know, I have to hide who I am every minute of the day. I have to hide who I am." Of course, in those days, you didn't really get what she meant, because it's not like it is now, where it's absolutely awesome.

Interviewer: What did you make of it when Mother said that?

Taty: Well, I took it in. "She has to hide who she is." And of course, she is an amazing actress. There's nobody better than her. She took me to the bank once. She wanted to get some jewelry out because her husband was taking her to some reception. So we went into this bank, she and I, and I think there was one other person. Mother changed. She looked like some little immigrant lady. She looked very meek. She had a camel coat on, and a scarf. We went up to the counter and the girl said, "Oh, shall I speak to you?" She spoke to me as if Mother didn't understand English. So Mother said, "Yes, you talk to her, you talk to her." So then they got the strongbox out, we went into the next room, and then all of that dropped. There was Mother. She's a superb actress.

Bernard Rackham: I have. I went shopping with Mother once in Southall. It was the weekend of some weddings in London. This is quite a well-documented story of mine.

We were living in the hotel in Bramham Gardens in Earl's Court. In those days, we had a housing collective in London. There was this guy who got hold of all these old properties that were up for redevelopment. It was the first time I was going to live collectively with yogis. The night before I moved in, he said, "Oh, I've just got hold of this big hotel. You've got to move in." So another yogi and I moved into this hotel. We were rattling around in this hotel for a couple of weeks, just the two of us with 20 bedrooms.

Then Shri Mataji, she had to move out of her old house, and the new house in Brompton Square wasn't ready. She said, "Oh, I'm moving into the hotel." Of course, immediately, the hotel filled up. Before Shri Mataji arrived, she had this weekend of weddings, so we put up all the yogis who came from abroad in the hotel. It was the first time I'd experienced having to cater for a large group of people.

They all turned up on the Friday night. We had a manic evening trying to produce food for 40 people and sorting people out. Then the next morning, we got the message from Mother that all the brides were to go and stay at Chelsham Road that evening. All the grooms were to go off to Southall to buy curtains and pajamas for the wedding. Suddenly, the house was empty again. We were left in this hotel on our own, twiddling our thumbs, wondering what I should do next, and probably drifting off into the left a bit.

Suddenly, the call went out, "Mother's here!" I thought, "Oh my God." We all rushed down into the foyer. Sure enough, it was Mother. Not only was it Mother, but there seemed to be a load of other yogis who had suddenly come out of the woodwork. We were standing there. Mother had come to look over where she was going to stay when she moved in. She said, "Oh, we couldn't find my car keys anywhere. We had to come over here by taxi. I need to go and do some shopping in Southall. Has anyone got a car?"

I was right at the back of this group of people, and I heard a voice at the front pointing to me, saying, "'He's got a car!'"

I don't know whether you could actually call it a car. It was a rusty old Mini. You don't see them in this state these days. It had rust in the floor; you could see the road. It had plants growing along in the windows. It had no suspension; the suspension was completely shot. It was just a complete wreck.

I was hustled to the front. She said, "Oh, that'll do." I said, "What? You surely don't want to go in this car, Mother?" She said, "Yes. No problem, no problem." We went out. It was an absolute wreck, this car. Anyway, I opened the door, Mother got in, and we drove off.

When we got to Southall, what's the first thing we see? A big group of Sahaja Yogis walking along the street. She said, "Oh, pull over, pull over!" I pulled over. Suddenly, the yogis surrounded the car. These yogis looked up and said, "Oh, who's that? It's Shri Mataji!" They all crowded around the car. Of course, it being Southall, if there's a crowd, a crowd gathers. Suddenly, there was this huge, great crowd of people all crowded around the car, all peering in, trying to see who or what was in the car.

Anyway, Shri Mataji gave some instructions to the yogis on the best place to go and buy some curtains and stuff. Then she said, "Right, we've got to go." We drove literally 40 yards up the road, parked the car, and got out. It was just me and Shri Mataji. We went into this sari shop. No crowd. Just Shri Mataji, another Indian lady walking into this sari shop. There couldn't have been more of a contrast.

Afterwards, I remember we went to another sari shop. Mother said, "I'll pull over." It was a yellow line. There was this bus right beside me. I leaped out, opening the door for Mother, and this bus stopped. The driver started swearing his head off at me. I thought, "He can't do this! I'm with the Adi Shakti!" Mother said, "Oh, you better go and park the car. Go and park the car." I went off and parked the car.

Then on the way back, I apologized for the state of the car's suspension because it was very bumpy. Mother said, "Oh, I don't feel anything. It's just like being on a cloud." Well, I certainly felt like I was on a cloud.

Interviewer: Yes, I was going to ask, how did it feel driving Mother?

Speaker 3: You can't really put it into words. On one front, you're very aware of the state of the car and Mother being there. But also, there's the state of joy and upliftment that you feel when Mother's there. Quite a contrast. I still don't know how to put it into words.

Speaker 4:

Mother was coming to the island. We'd arranged to pick her up at Fishbourne Ferry. Me and my family were waiting for Mother. The phone went, and someone said, "Mother's here." I said, "Oh, she'll be down at Fishbourne." "No, no," they said, "she's at Ryde," which is 11 miles further on. I thought, "God, how can I keep Mother waiting all that time?"

So me and my oldest son jumped in the car and shot to the end of the street. As we got to the end of the street, an ambulance was going past, so we got in behind the ambulance and drove all the way to Ryde, right past the ferry. It was amazing. We just stuck to this ambulance. I don't know where it was going; it just drifted off once we got to Ryde. We went straight up to the pier. I said to my son, "Murray, I'm very sorry," and she was like, "No, don't worry. I've been vibrating the place. Never worry about that," she said. "You're always in time."

We drove back. It was amazing that we got all that way behind this ambulance in about five minutes. It took us about a third of the normal time. But these are the sort of strange things that used to happen all the time. When I asked Mother, "Could I drive?" She said, "Of course you can. Who else would drive?" This is how beautiful she was. Very, very simple and very unbelievable.

Speaker 5: That's right. Most of the stories are unbelievable. That's why we keep them to ourselves, I think.

Well, you had to wait that night, didn't you? Yes, Ruth. In Bristol. Tell us the story of the keys and everything.

Yes, Shri Mataji stayed with us in Bristol for the night. And then we went on to Exeter, where in one day, Shri Mataji held a little puja with about 12 people, did a television interview, a public programme, and then after that, she decided she wanted to go back to Bristol again. So I set out with Mother. She said, "Come with me."

Just after we set out, I realised that Chris, my husband, had the key to our house. So I said, "Mother, my husband's got the key." She said, "Let's go back." We went back—we hadn't been gone long—but he'd already left with Linda Pearce and Datta, her son.

So meanwhile, we went back to Bristol and arrived at the old vicarage. This was a big house where we had a flat. We couldn't get in because Chris hadn't turned up with the key. So we waited for a while. He didn't turn up. This went on and on. Mother got me to try her keys in the door. Time passed, and I was thinking, "Gosh, what are we going to do?" Mother went to sleep in the front seat, and all sorts of things were going through my mind.

Eventually, she woke up again and said, "Why don't we go and get a drink?" So we drove around Bristol for a while but couldn't find anywhere to get a drink; everywhere was shut by that time. But we found a little street vendor in one of these little vans, and we had hot chocolate. I remember that. It was very nice. We talked about hot chocolate and whether it was good for your liver. I think it was Nick Kershaw who said, "But what if we've got a bad liver, Mother?" And she said, "Oh, just have it with less milk. It's a very good drink to have before you go to bed at night. But don't have tea after 6 o'clock."

Then we drove around and came back to the Orford Bridge, and they still weren't there. By now, it was really, really late, like 2 o'clock in the morning or something. We just didn't know what had happened to Chris and Linda. So I was thinking, "Oh, gosh, what are we going to do?"

There was another flat in Bristol where my brother was living, where I'd previously lived, which was a very, very humble place. There were four of us living in a one-bedroom flat. In the end, I said, "Mother, there is another flat we could go to," because I just thought we had to go somewhere for the night. And Alan lives there. She said, "Oh, let's go there."

So we went there, and Alan Richards had gone to bed. He woke up when he heard the front door and came to the door. He was all covered in cum-cum and kajal on his eyes. He came to the door, and there was Shri Mataji at the front door. It was such a humble place. In the main bedroom, there was just a mattress on the floor, not even a proper bed.

Another speaker interjects:

Yes, it was. Not when she must have slept there. Because believe me, I remember. She slept in my bed.

The first speaker continues:

Well, she was sleeping on a mattress on the floor. This was Hampton Road. Well, my version of the story is what had happened was the Exeter yogis had put on a meal for everyone after the public programme, and most of the yogis went back to this place for a meal. And Ruth had gone off with Mother. This is how I remember it.

Another speaker interjects:

Tell us the story, because I'm going to lose the thread.

The first speaker continues:

Alright. This was in... it was before I had my daughter, so it was 1982, in about November, I think. So we went back to this flat, and Mother slept in the bedroom on the mattress on the floor. Pam was there, and it was Janet Ridley, me, and Pam. We all slept in the hall outside Mother's room. There were a few men, I think—I can't remember who they were—but they were in the sitting room.

In the morning, Mother said, "Oh, where did you sleep?" And we said, "In the hall, Mother." She said, "Oh, you should have slept in here with me."

She told us to wake her up at 8:30 in the morning, I think it was. So Janet and I went in at 8:30. We hadn't gotten much sleep that night, and we didn't want to wake Mother up. We didn't know how to wake Mother up. We just went in and bowed down, and we both fell asleep. So we were bowed down on the floor, fast asleep.

Eventually, Mother woke up. Mother said, "Go and find out what's happened. Where was Chris and everything?" So I went to the phone box, because we didn't have any mobile phones or anything then. We didn't even have a phone in the flat. I went and phoned Chris, and what had happened was, they'd broken down on the motorway. They had the key, and they'd broken down—it was Linda Pearce and him and Datta. So by the time they got back, obviously, all this had happened.

Meanwhile, Alan, my brother, had come back to the old vicarage. He had laid down in his car, sleeping, to wait for someone to turn up. He must have come after Mother had left. And then Chris and Linda came back and went into the flat, not seeing Alan. So Alan spent the night outside the old vicarage, asleep, when he actually lived in the flat that she was sleeping in. He'd had the desire for her to come to the flat. So it was just so funny, the whole thing. It was a whole comedy of errors. He was sleeping outside the old vicarage, unaware of any of this going on. This is where Mother was supposed to be staying with us, where she'd stayed the previous night before we went to Exeter.

Another speaker shares their version:

Well, my version of events was this: the Exeter yogis had put on a meal for us. So most of the yogis—I remember there were quite a number of people who'd come down from London for this programme—stayed for the meal. We eventually got back to Bristol at 2 o'clock in the morning to find Mother locked out of your flat. So we said, "Oh, you'd better come back to our flat."

I remember rushing back to our flat, which, as I said, had four boys sleeping in a one-bedroom basement flat, and we had about 20 people staying there. Of course, we rushed into the bedroom and rushed around to make sure there wasn't anything nasty lurking, like dirty socks or anything. A quick clean-up before Mother arrived. And then Mother arrived in the room. And I remember her actually, before we vacated the room, just sitting down and getting into the bed. Everyone backed off, and I remember there were some ladies who actually slept in the room with her.

A speaker reconciles the stories:

In the hall, that night. It must have been a different night.

The first speaker confirms:

Yeah, Chris wrote it all down in his diary. I assure you, it was Pam, me, and Janet Ridley sleeping in the hall outside Mother's room. And in the morning, I apologised to Mother. I said, "I'm so sorry you had to sleep on this mattress on the floor and in such humble surroundings." And she said, "Don't worry. It's fine. It's been a lovely bed. I've had a lovely time. Don't worry. It's been fine."

Another speaker adds:

Well, I remember there was a bed which Mother slept in. That's very, very interesting how one instance can have two...

Yeah, because I had to sleep on the floor three nights after that.

A new anecdote is shared:

Well, yes, she was in Brompton Square once. I remember being in there, and Shri Mataji was sleeping behind the front door. She had this huge house and a beautiful bedroom, but she wasn't in the room because the grandchildren were watching the television. Mother was asleep on the floor next to the front door. Wow. Amazing.

All of you spent a considerable amount of time with Mother in a very informal manner. Do you remember any advice on day-to-day things that Mother gave you?

Shall I tell you something? This was quite a big lesson. It's helped me. I'm sorry, my phone went off. Does somebody want to put my bag in the hall? I don't want it to go off again. Would you mind? Thank you.

I was looking after her visa, her passport. I had to go to the High Commission a lot. Usually, people knew who Mr. Srivastava was because he was Secretary-General of the International Maritime Organisation. And then the staff changed. She had to have it renewed; she had about four books all stuck together. And this man was so horrible. He was unbelievable. He didn't know who Mr. Srivastava was; he'd never heard of Mr. Srivastava. Anyway, to cut a long story short, he wouldn't do anything for me.

I went out quickly and I rang Sir CP's office and I told the secretary. I didn't dare speak to Sir CP. And they told me what to do when dealing with this man. He was a really horrible person. I've got quite a quick temper, and he just made me so angry. I could have smacked his face.

A few months later, I had to go again to get some visas. And I got the wrong ones because of him. I got uptight, and he gave me the wrong thing. I remember going round to Mother's house with this passport. I gave it to her, and she said, "This isn't right. You've done the wrong thing here." So I said, "Well, this man was so horrible."

She sent the family out of the room. She said to me, "Did I give you that necklace?" I had a crummy old necklace on. I said, "No, Mother." She said, "Well, I'm glad I didn't give you that." And then she changed her tone. She said to me, "Now, this man... you can't afford to behave like that. You're not a street woman. You've got to be very, very nice to him. You've got to go in and say, 'Thank you very much. That is so kind of you.'"

So I went in again. He was horrible. I felt my gorge rising up. I thought, "No." "Thank you very much. That's so kind of you." And eventually, that man became my best friend in the High Commission. He used to give me letters that they weren't allowed to take out of the High Commission for Mother to sort out. And it was a standing joke, because every time I went round to Mother's house, Sir CP used to say, "And how is Mr. Seeping?"

And actually, that's what happened. It was a big lesson. That if you're dealing with somebody horrible, you just have to be very nice. "Thank you very much." And I've tried that many times since, and it never fails. And that's from Mother's good advice.

Sometimes I think—it's just my experience—that what Mother says in her talks and all, it's so important that you have to put it more into practice than just listen. And to put it into practice is more difficult. In my work, I find there's a lot of gossiping and this and that going on. But I remember my father used to say that even if a negative thought comes to your mind, it can affect the other person. And it's very true. So what I do is, I just let my love flow, and that can really change the opposite person as well.

In the past, I've had managers who have been not very nice to me for no reason. Of course, it upsets you and all that. But then you just forgive. And when you forgive, you really have to forgive. It's a very difficult thing. Forgive from the heart, and let the love flow. That changes the person, and you'll be surprised to see that that person really changes. Not only that, another manager once told me, "My God, you're the only person I've seen in the store that you are neither with this one, nor that one." I said, "See, when I do sharing, I do it from the heart. You may like it, or you may not like it."

Because there's so much—like Mother has said in a prayer—"not to lead me into superficiality." And there's so much superficiality in society that is unbelievable. Sometimes you think, "Oh my God, if I behave this way, maybe she might think I'm superficial," because the society is full of superficiality. But I said, "No, no, I shouldn't think negative like that. Today or tomorrow, she will realize that I am not superficial, I am genuine."

And sometimes, Mother tries to show the society that you're genuine. I work in a store, and I got an award from one of my customers who nominated me, which I didn't know. My name was in the newspaper, and my photograph and everything. It was such a... everybody was stunned. All the English people and all the other people, they were stunned. "Aren't we good enough?" And I said, "I didn't do anything, I just do it from the heart." Not only that, even in the newspaper interview, I just said that when I'm helping customers or whatever, I just do it genuinely. I don't just do it for the show.

So, it's a real experience that you really have to forgive and spread that love from the heart. It just flows, and today or tomorrow, it makes a difference.

You came to England after marriage?

Yes. Actually, there are a few experiences I’ve had with Mother. Anand was very small, and I was on a tour with Mother. I was not going to go to another place called Sholapur, and Mother said, "Are you coming?" I said, "No Mother, I want to get back to work." Mother said, "No, no, you must come there." So, Mother gave bandhan to my work and said, "Oh, you must come there." I said, "All right, I'll get there," because Mother had to arrange my engagement, which I didn't even know. On the tour, Mother arranged this engagement.

Before marriage, I had really quite a bit of ego. I got married in 1983, and I think not many people at that time were married to an English person. My Mother knows everybody's heart, though I hadn't told her that I didn't want to get married to an English person. Actually, Mother said to my brother, "Your sister won't accept the boy that I choose for her." My mother was looking for an Indian girl for someone, and I wasn't really ready at all. I really didn't want to get married to a foreign boy because of the very high conditioning in India. Now it's all changed—it's been 27 years—but you can imagine, if an Indian girl took an English husband to India... I don’t know, the whole of Bombay would react.

What I'm trying to say is that Mother makes you realize; she doesn't push you. She makes you understand, gives you time, patience, and everything. So Mother made me realize that she wanted me to come to the West and she wanted me to do her work, so she brought me here. Even when my father was looking for a boy in India, it was not getting matched. In fact, Mother shows her Maya as she is. Because she, being Adi Shakti, even arranged a boy from India for me, and that didn't work out because she knew where I was meant to be. But in order to fulfill the desires of the Sahaja Yogis, she plays the drama.

And then, of course, I went to Mother's feet and I said, "Mother, I surrender all my goodwill to you." I knew that my brother is a very strong Sahaja Yogi and he was going to get married. My parents are going to die one day or the other, and I'll be left in India with nobody. So it's better to surrender myself now. That was in Nilambar, Rajesh Shah's flat in 1981 or '82. I was with Mother in the car, and Mother said, "There's a boy in England." I was sitting very close to her; I still remember Mother's hand was on here. She said, "There's a boy in England," and I said, "Oh, there is a boy in England. I don't have to worry now." Still, I didn't know when it was going to happen, so I thought I shouldn't worry. But Mother is Adi Shakti, and it's again a Maya.

Then, that's the time when Mother asked me to come to Rahuri, and that's where my engagement took place. Actually, Mother had asked Malcolm, my husband, before me, and I had no idea that she had already spoken to him. I was with Mother in the room, and she said, "Can you go out?" So I went out, and that's when Malcolm came in. Mother had given him the choice to choose either an Indian girl or an Australian girl, and he said, "It's all right, this Indian girl." But it's such a Maya that Malcolm had already come to my house the year before.

So he'd already visited you before?

Yes, and I knew him as just a Sahaja Yogi and a foreigner, and I’d even said hello, but I didn't know he was going to be my husband. Then Mother just asked me one day—there was going to be a havan in Rahuri—and Mother said, "Okay, now I'm announcing the engagement of Malcolm and Kamakshi." My name was Kamakshi before marriage, and Mother changed it to Meenakshi. She even said, "So that in England, people can call you Meena." So the non-Sahaja Yogis call me Meena.

She even told me to do my driving test in India and also typing. When I came to the West, I learned driving and I passed the first time. I used to think people who pass the first time must be really something. I didn't know I was! When the examiner told me I had passed, I said, "Oh my God." I couldn't believe it. I literally started crying in front of him. In the morning, I had stolen the car, and Malcolm said to me, "You have got a test today, Meenakshi!" He couldn't believe it because in his family, they had all passed on the second or third time.

When Mother announced the engagement, she mentioned Kamakshi's name. I had Mother's handbag with me because she wanted a handkerchief or something, but she had already just asked me whether Malcolm was alright for me. I said yes, and she just announced the engagement. Finished. That's it. And four days later, I was married. So that was that quick.

But when I was with Mother once, she asked me to put my hand on her chakras. I remember Swadhishthan chakra and Agnya chakra, and I could feel the vibrations of the chakras so strongly. You can't really take the vibrations from Mother; they're very strong chakras. That time Mother said, "I'm taking all the badhas from you, and I'm trying to clear the chakras." That was all before the marriage. Afterwards, the engagement took place, and then the marriage.

And then you came to England, didn't you?

Yes, I came to England. I got married on January 21st or 22nd. There were two marriages at that time. We used to live very close to the airport, so a lot of Sahaja Yogis—Patricia, Kay, everybody—had come to my place. The wedding was going to take place on the 21st, but all of a sudden she said it will happen the next day. Mother was there the whole five hours. Mine was the only marriage, and Mother was there for the whole thing.

Where was this happening?

In Bombay, in Mumbai, at Sion. When the engagement took place in Rahuri, my father was concerned about how we would get a hall in Bombay. Somebody cancelled the hall for four days, and all the foreigners could stay upstairs, and there was a hall downstairs. The non-Sahaja Yogis had never seen a marriage like this, because all the foreigners had put on saris and gajras. It was a remarkable marriage. Mother just got us married. Rahul Bhai was there, and she was on the stage. I was very fortunate, honestly, to have such a special thing. After the marriage, there was a drama and things like that, so she spent time and was really satisfied. She said to my father, "I'm really very pleased with everything today."

I’ll go back to a funny thing which I've just remembered. When Mother came to stay at our house, I was at middle school, a Church of England school. I went to school one day, and I think in a religious class, I told the teacher that God was staying at my house. I was 10 or 11, whatever age it was. We talked about God, and it was like, "Well, it's okay, because she's at my house." I think my mother was summoned to the school to know what her child was saying. My mum went along with probably Kingsley or someone like that, and the pair of them explained that I wasn't crazy and that she was there last week, but she's left now. The teacher just thought they were absolutely crazy and wasn't convinced at all when he left. But Mum was absolutely sure that God was staying there, so he was wrong, and she was right.

Children say such funny things. My daughter brought one of her friends home from school, and the friend saw a photograph of Shri Mataji there. My daughter was about six then, and the friend said, "Who's that?" And my daughter said, "My Mother." The friend looked a bit surprised, and then Lakshmi pointed at me and said, "That's not my Mother, that's just the person that looks after me."

Oh, really? That reminds me of my granddaughter. She had a badge of Mother, and one of her friends said, "Who's that?" She said, "That's God's wife." She was nine at the time. "She's God's wife."

Mother did a chicken dish with rice, and it was absolutely fantastic. Whenever I tried to repeat it, without the recipe I might add, it never really worked. Until we went to America, and two male Sahaja Yogis, Shamik and Suhas, recreated this dish from Mother's cookbook, and it was just like Mother made it. It was absolutely wonderful, wasn't it?

Absolutely, just like she made it. She used to cook for everyone at Caxton Hall. She cooked these vast meals; in fact, lots of my friends went because of the meal. It was so nourishing. We heard later that Mother was clearing out the navel, you see. We all went into thoughtlessness. It was fantastic, and she'd sit there for hours while people were eating this food. Every individual that went up to her, she'd be there for hours and hours. And there used to be many, many people. She cleared us all out with that, because people were in quite a bad state.

I had a meal at Judy's that Mother had cooked, and I just felt so satisfied that I couldn't move. For about two or three hours afterwards, I was just sitting, and it was bliss. I felt all this beautiful, comforting warmth spreading out from my navel. I literally felt as if I was floating after I'd eaten this food.

Are there any miracles that stand out in your memory that you'd like to share now?

There's the one over the passport. This was when I first dealt with the passport. I went to the High Commission. She wanted some pages put in because she'd run out. She was going back to India, so I went round with her book, and I said to the man, "Mrs. Srivastava would like some more pages, please." And he said, "No, I can't do it. She's still got a page left." I said, "Well, she's going to India, and she's going touring." "No, I can't do it. If I make an exception for her, I have to do it with everybody." People are very difficult. So I took the passport back and I said to Mother, "He won't do it, Mother." She said, "I want it done. Go back."

So I went back with this passport and I said, "I'm sorry, Shri Mataji needs these pages." He categorically said he wouldn't do it. So I took the passport back to Mother and said, "I'm sorry, Mother, he won't do it." She said, "All right."

I was sitting on a tree stump in Ganapatipule, and I heard her say there was a miracle with the passport. She said some pages appeared. So I pricked up my ears. She came back to London in April, I got the passport, and there, on the very day when he said he wouldn't give it, was the stamp with his name and the pages.

That's an amazing one with bandhan. In the early days, I used to put bandhans on things, but I didn't really believe with my heart. I found it very hard to believe that doing this could actually affect anything. We went to a puja in London, and Mother was talking about bandhans. "When you put a bandhan on something, it's like you're actually telephoning to me." I really thought about it and was trying to imbibe what she was saying.

That night, we were staying at Janet Ridley's flat in London. We were going on to Sussex the next day to see Chris's grandfather. We just had Lakshmi then, and she was very small. In the morning, we had to catch a train. When we came to get ready to go, we couldn't find one of Lakshmi's shoes. It was in November, so it was cold. It was a very modern flat, so it wasn't like there were lots of nooks and crannies. We searched high and low. We could not find this little red shoe anywhere. Time was going on, and we had to leave to get the train.

Suddenly, I was sitting in the middle of the carpet and I thought, "Bandhan. Put the bandhan on." I started to put the bandhan on, and the shoe dropped into my lap. Janet's husband was standing next to me, and he saw it too. He said, "Where did that come from?" And I said, "It just fell through the air." After that, it had a very profound effect on me because I really, really believed in bandhans. I have always used them, and I always find them very effective.

Someone injured their foot and split it wide open. It was a really bad injury. Mother said, "Oh, make her comfortable. Bring her here. I want Sahaja Yogis to work on her all night." This happened. And the next day—only people like us would believe it—when she got up, there was no mark on her foot.

When we were going to this place, Shaptashringi, some mountain, Mother warned us that anyone that had been to a false guru shouldn't go. So off we all went and spent the whole day climbing. When we came back, we had our tea, sang some bhajans, and went to bed. The next morning, a friend was lying in his bunk, and one of his mates said, "Look at the state of him!" And he was covered in blisters. Someone went and told Shri Mataji, and she said, "I did warn people that went to a false guru, you should not come." She said, "He'll be okay. This is just a sort of a warning." These were the sort of things that happened. It was so powerful, unbelievable really. And you can only mention these stories to Sahaja Yogis, because no one else would believe you.

I was about 11 or 12. I'd made my way to the front when Mother was leaving. She used to stand by the car door and then sit down, still talking to a few people. I was right at the very front, talking to Mother, and I had my hand on the central column. Someone loaded the car and then just slammed the back door, which caught my hand in it. Straight away, the door was opened, and I took my hand out, which was completely blistered and purple. Mother just took it and held it, told me not to cry, told me to be strong. In about two or three minutes, she let go of my hand, and there was nothing there whatsoever. No pain or nothing.

Two or three minutes?

Yeah. I think even then, as a youngster, I just thought, "Great." I think it had a more profound effect on everybody else than on me, but it's something I still remember.

At Brompton Square, we were cleaning the bathrooms with a very dark brown furniture polish on all the marble. There was about a third of a bottle left. We did several bathrooms, and when we got to the top, Magda said, "Oh, Mother, isn't it amazing? You've done all these bathrooms." And as we talked, the polish went over the top. It flowed over the top, onto the beautiful new, golden-colored carpet in Sir C.P.'s room. It made this terrible mark. Mother said, "We praised it so much, and that's what's happened. Go and get some water." We put some water on this terrible stain, and Mother put a bandhan and said, "Don't worry about it." The next day, I went up to the room to sort it out and I forgot about the stain. Then I remembered it, and there was not even a speck. Not a speck. You did take them for granted in the end, didn't you? So many things happened, you just thought it was normal.

At the bottom of the staircase, did you ever see that? One day, David and I went, and they said, "Go and look at the piece of carving at the bottom of the stairs." And instead of a knob, there was this beautiful carving of a Negro bending over. It was beautiful. We went back a couple of days later, and Mother said to us, "Go and look at the bottom of the stairs." We went down, and the back wasn't smooth. You could count all the vertebrae and all the ribs.

There were stories where builders would run out of cement, go to have something to eat, and when they came back, there was enough cement to get the jobs done. All sorts of strange things happened. At Brompton Square, Fergie told a story where he couldn't get plaster to stick on the front of her house. Mother mixed some paint with the plaster, and he said she did a perfect metre of plastering, and it stuck perfectly. I'm sure you'll get these stories from the people that were involved in it.

What about the wallpaper in that beautiful dining room? It had been an old garage in the basement that Mother turned into an exquisite dining room. They put some of this lovely paper on the wall; it was silver with Birds of Paradise on it. They got it in Harrods, but they ran out. So Mother said, "Oh, we'll go and get some," but they didn't have any more. She said, "Go and look in that cupboard, at the back." And they found two more rolls of paper.

There was some wallpapering that Lewis and someone else did. They had to do it very quickly because I think Mother wanted it done so it would be nice when C.P. came. When they saw it had dried, there was a gap of about a quarter of an inch between the sheets. They were really worried. She said, "Don't worry, you can use the vibrations for this. Come along, help me. Push the paper together." And it actually came together. It was perfect. They're all pushing this paper.

In those days, Mother used to go out to various places. Have you been to any places where there were days out, picnics, shopping?

Picnic, yeah. We used to stay in the castle, and Shri Mataji and her granddaughters and I just went to a picnic. It was such an enjoyable day. Mother showed me how to make keema, because she knew her granddaughters liked paratha and keema. We had such a lovely time. In those days, I was working in India, and Mother wouldn't take any money for the tour from me. I said to Mother, "No, I'm working, I can afford it. Please take the money." She said, "No, no, no, you're looking after me and the grandchildren, there's no need for you to pay." I really requested her, so Mother said, "Okay, come on, I'll take the money."

One day she said, "Let's go for shopping." So the grandchildren, myself, and Mother all went shopping. Mother bought some shoes for the grandchildren and she bought some slippers for me as well. I wore those slippers for my wedding. And she said to me, "See, I'm using your rupees that you gave me." It makes you feel so important. It's so sweet.

When I was traveling with her, I saw that the pop socks she wore dug right into her legs. It was horrible. So when we were in London, I searched the West End for some wide ones, and the only thing I could find were bright purple. I bought them and gave them to Mother. She put them in the case. We went to New York, and she got dressed. She came out in this beautiful purple sari with a gold border, and she had little golden slippers and these purple stockings that exactly matched the sari.

We had this puja, and about two years later, I was at a seminar, I think it was in Birmingham, and two ladies from that New York puja came. They said to me, "Do you know what did it for us? It was those purple socks." That's what did it for us. And they became very good Sahaja Yogis. It just shows you there's nothing wasted. Nothing's a mistake.

I remember one time someone gave Mother a teddy bear for a present. I felt rather cynical about it. I thought, "Oh my God, why are they giving Mother a teddy bear?" Then a couple of weeks later, I was in her bedroom in Brompton Square, and there was this teddy bear taking pride of place on her bed. Amazing. Nothing's wasted.

Did you get presents from Mother?

Oh, yeah. Yes. Well, one was a strange one because I'd never expected a present. I expected a reprimand. There was a puja coming up, and I didn't feel worthy of going. I had some sort of negative thoughts and I just didn't want to go. I felt hypocritical. So I didn't go. My friends all went.

We all sat in front of Shri Mataji, and she said, "Where is your husband?" I looked around and thought, "Oh, he's at home, Mother." She said, "Tell him he has no badhas. Give him this." It was some white cotton linen. I couldn't believe it. I've still got the white cloth. That's the only present I've ever had.

Have you had it made into something?

No, I've just kept it. It's so pretty. But that was the story, which is amazing.

That reminds me, I turned up at a public programme one night with a terrible left Vishuddhi. I sat right at the back of the hall, as far away from Mother as I possibly could. At the end of the programme, Mother said, "Right, all the yogis can come up and give me a flower." I thought, "I'm not going anywhere near Mother, not in this state." There was a long queue, and I was waiting for it to go down because I needed to speak to a yogi who was in the queue. I thought, "Well, I'll just go and talk to him while he's in the queue."

I started having this conversation with him, and the queue had dwindled, so he got close enough to Mother for the vibrations to welcome me in. I thought I might as well stay. The queue went down and down, and eventually, it got to the chap right in front of me. Mother said to him, "Oh, how are you then?" And he said, "I've got left Vishuddhi." Mother said, "I beg your pardon?" He said, "I've got left Vishuddhi." Mother turned to me and she said, "What did he say?" I said, "He's got left Vishuddhi." So Mother worked on him, and then got up and went out. She didn't bother to see me.

The other time I remember about presents was after a puja up at the Temple of All Faiths. She bought all the men ties. She brought these ties out, and they all matched what we were already wearing. I remember one chap had a check shirt, and she brought out this check tie. It was incredible.

I had an amazing experience in Pune. It was at a market, and Mother was there with a few of her relatives. I was feeling not very good about myself, and I was hoping that Mother wouldn't turn her attention to me. I was kind of holding back, watching her from a distance. She was absolutely surrounded by people. This went on for about an hour. Then I got involved in buying some silk paintings at one of the stalls. When I had finished, I looked up and suddenly there was hardly anyone in the market. Everyone seemed to have gone. I kind of relaxed because Mother wasn't there.

I was walking along and suddenly I was completely alone, and she was coming towards me. We looked at each other and I bowed to her and she said, "How are you, Ruth?" I said, "I'm fine, thank you, Mother." And she said, "Just enjoy. Just enjoy." Then she walked past. When I got back to the camp, I said, "I met Mother at the market," and they said, "No, that's impossible because she was surrounded by people the whole time she was there."

Once in Ealing, a Sahaja Yogini was wearing a really nice, sparkly necklace. Her skin is very white, and I just thought, "Oh, she must have a diamond one." I just thought about it in my head. An hour later, Mother went to the airport, and exactly the same necklace, she gave to someone to give to me. I got the same necklace.

At Judy Camp's house, Mother gave me some seed pearl earrings. She didn't give them directly to me; she gave them to Nita, who was looking after her, to give to me. They were on a metal post, but not silver, and my skin comes up when I have metal which isn't silver. I took them thinking they were lovely, but what a shame because I couldn't wear them. At that moment, Nita walked in again with another pair of pearl earrings and she said, "Mother said, give these to Ruth, on gold this time. And tell her they're real." Then she asked Nita when Nita came back, "What did Ruth say?" She wanted to know what I said when I got them.

Before marriage, you need some money for a Mangalsutra. We went to India and got this Mangalsutra. She held it, and there were such tremendous vibrations. That's a present from Shri Mataji, the Mangalsutra. The Mangalsutra is the marriage necklace with gold and black beads that a married woman wears.

Sometimes one looked down at oneself and one was dressed by Mother. The sari, the jewellery, everything. She's been so unbelievably generous, and always something very beautiful.

I have a question for you. Did Mother say something about jewellery, some precious stones or metals?

Pearls were good for certain things. Silver is very cooling.

Did she say that we should all wear something gold?

She told me to wear gold because of my hair. She said I should wear something gold. But she's given me several amber necklaces. I don't know if it's supposed to calm you down, but I've got about four, so there must be something. I've got a hot liver.

She's given me pearls several times, including this long set here. The day after she gave me these, she said, "You have to become like a pearl on the necklace I gave you yesterday."

I always felt it was because we had to be protected. I know when I put mine on, it's like putting on armor. You go out and you put things on because it's a protection. It's like when you see in the films Arjuna putting on his stuff. It's like that.

One day Shri Mataji, her granddaughter, and I were watching a movie. Her granddaughter's name is Anupama. I was rubbing Shri Mataji's feet. Suddenly Mother would ask, "What's happened, what's happened?" and we would just laugh and laugh. I was rubbing Mother's feet, but there were so many thoughts in my head. Suddenly I felt really nervous. Mother said, "Don't feel guilty." Sometimes it's really joyful, but sometimes when you massage Mother's feet and you think, "Why are these thoughts coming?" it happens.

In America, we were watching The Wizard of Oz once. You know when they all faint in the poppy field? She said, "This is prophetic. This film is prophetic." Then I wasn't there, but a few days later they were watching 2001: A Space Odyssey. When HAL, the computer, really started to take over, Mother told them to turn it off. She said, "Once they take over, you'll be finished."

Another time, in Hampstead, we called around and Mother had the television on. There was Mother sitting there. It was Marilyn Monroe and Robert Mitchum. She plays a nightclub girl. It was really embarrassing. At the end, he picks her up and takes her off, and her red, spangly shoe falls off. Mother turned around and said, "That was a very good film." Then she turned it over and it was James Bond and Pussy Galore. It was terrible. And then she said, "He's only with one."

I watched Gaslight with Mother once. I was in her house, and Helen Marsden was there as well. Mother was walking around the room. She said, "I'm bored. What shall we do?" She got the remote and pointed it at the television, and immediately up came Gaslight. She said, "Oh, this is a very good film. I like this. Watch this." I sat next to Mother on the settee. All the way through, Mother was talking about how dignified the heroine looked and how well they spoke. The film is about a man who drives his wife mad by telling her she's stolen things. She kept commenting on this man, how evil he was, completely evil. Then the heroine turns on the husband, and he's all tied in a chair, and she's giving him what for. And Mother said, "That's it, that's it! You tell him, you tell him!"

I can tell you a small little thing. Mother was at the airport. I had been to see her, but Malcolm was at work. I told Mother that, by her grace, Malcolm was doing well. He's got a company car, but his company is sending him to some other place called Luton. I really didn't want to go so far. But Mother said, "No, you should always go wherever the husband goes." I said, "Oh my God." He was looking for a house over there, but then we had to sell this house or rent another. Too many things. In the end, I think he stayed here, but the point is, you have to go where the husband goes.

She's on a tape where she talks about how to have a happy marriage. This was in Australia, I think in 1979. She says that the husband comes home from work and says to the wife, "Oh, I fancy a pancake." And the wife says, "Oh, I'm too tired." Or she's been indoors all day and says, "I'm fed up. I'd like to go out." And he says, "Oh, I can't. I'm too tired." Mother said, "She should be dying to do what he wants, and he should be dying to do what she wants." We have tried that in our marriage, and it absolutely works. It's wonderful advice, and it's so simple. It's just love, really, to care about what the other one wants.

I also feel that Mother's talks really transform you. I can see it in practice. My Sahaja Yogi children—my daughters are now 26 and 24—I'm surprised. The other day, they said to me, "Do you know what, Mummy? To correct you. That's why they've been born." They have such knowledge that they can really correct you in such a subtle way and make you realize that what you're doing is wrong. And she told me, "Mummy, all men are the same. They are like babies." I said, "My God." When she was expecting her, Mother had told me that a big soul was coming, taking birth on the earth. Even when she was nine years old, she had told her cousin, whom she had not seen for a long time, "Do you know what? I've seen God. That's why we are studying there, because that's God's place." These realized souls, they are really different. It's amazing.

Did you get advice from Shri Mataji about how to bring children up?

Simple advice. She just said, "You discipline them, and I'll love them. I'll give them the love, you give them the discipline."

When my daughter was young, she told me how to put oil on her head, on the talu, so that it has to be filled. She showed me how to put the oil this way and then rub it towards the middle.

I was taking Lakshmi past Mother's bedroom door, and I hadn't put tights on her. I knew that Mother would say she should have tights on. I tried to sneak past the door, and just as I was going past, Mother said, "Ruth? She should have tights on." She would also ask what I was giving her to eat. I had a little cardigan on her, and she said, "Where did this come from?" I'd actually bought it in a charity shop. And then she said, "You should knit for her yourself."

I remember she said we should give babies khichdi, rice and moong dal. That's very good for babies, and I used to give that.

One funny story. When we were at Brompton Square, I was up on the roof overlooking the garden next door. It was springtime, and there was this magnolia tree. I was admiring it and I wondered how long it had been there and how much the person who planted it had actually paid for it. There was a public meeting that night, and during the course of the lecture, Mother said, "When you see a beautiful tree, just enjoy it. Don't stand there asking how long it's been there or how much it costs."

Being with Mother is difficult because all your things come out in cinemascope. I remember sitting at her feet and I said, "Well, it's wonderful being with you, Mother, but it's awful as well." She said, "Yes, that's what it's like with Mother."

She sometimes has a way of reflecting back your nervous habits so that you see them yourself. I had a habit of saying, "You know what I mean?" after everything I said. Once I said something to Mother, and then said, "Do you know what I mean?" And she said, "No."

I was addicted to sunbathing, and I had a horrible lesson over that. I've never sunbathed since. We were in Switzerland, and I went out for a walk on a hot, sunny afternoon. I said I'd go down to the lake and sit under a tree, but of course, I sat in the sun. I came back, looked in the mirror—yes, nice, little pinkish-brown. So I went into Mother's room, and she said, "Oh, Baba, what have you done? What have you done to yourself?" Shouting. "Look at her face! Look what she's done. Now, tomorrow you're not to go out."

So the next day, I didn't go out. That night, I had to sleep under the kitchen table and was bitten by mosquitoes all night. The next day, the whole side of my face was covered in lumps. They were all going out for the program, and she said, "Aren't you coming?" I said, "No, you told me not to go out, Mother." She said, "Yes, it's all right, you come." I was sitting in the front of the car, and she was behind. She must have seen my face in the sun. "What's wrong with your face?" she said. I said, "Well, I got bitten by the mosquitoes." I never sunbathed after that. That was a horrible lesson.

I have some patches here, black things. Mother used to tell me, "Get some Fade Out." I used it, and it's all gone now.

On one of my trips to India, we were at some weddings where they have the Haldi. I remember we were told to go and wash it off in the sea and then go back into the shade. I think I must have been about 14 or 15, and I thought, "I'll get a bit of a colour before I go back." So I stayed out in the sun for quite a while. The Haldi and the sun had an effect on me, and I got covered in blisters all across the top of my body. I was being cared for by my mum and some of the ladies.

Anyway, I was summoned to go and see Mother. I was really, really nervous. I presumed she knew it was me. As I walked in, she just looked at me and she said, "I might have known it would be you," with a bit of a stern look. I said, "I'm sorry." She ended up giving us all one of her saris each and calamine lotion, and we got wrapped in the saris to heal. But it was very nerve-wracking, almost like waiting outside the headmaster's office.

I have one experience. When you're pregnant, you should not go to certain places. We went to a Camden Town meeting. I was seven months pregnant, and when I got there, I couldn't get up. When I came home, I told John I wasn't going to the hospital because they might take the baby out. John phoned Shri Mataji, and she just said, "Okay, come to Cabella." We weren’t sure if the airplane would allow me to travel, but we just prayed to Mother. We went to Cabella. In India, when you're seven months pregnant, you can go to your mother's home for the delivery. It was like that. Mother just called us there, and I had the baby there. She's quite lucky. After 11 days, Mother held her. I really wanted to take some photographs, and she said, "Okay, take them. How many do you want?" Mother held her for the photographs. Mother said her eyes were really beautiful, so she gave her a name based on that. Mother said, "It's a very old soul who has come."

Sometimes when you have a desire in your heart, you just tell Mother. My daughter, when she was born, had lovely pictures taken by Malcolm, all smiling, her face basically glittering. You want to show Mother those pictures, but I told myself, "No, Meenakshi, don't do stupid things. It's your ego pampering you. Be quiet." So I didn't show them. Anyway, Mother went to India and she came back and she said, "Oh, your daughter's pictures? I've seen them. Your father showed them to me." Plus, at the airport, she told me this without me even asking. I was just standing there to greet her, and she gave me the message that she had seen those pictures. She fulfills just the desire.

When we have Adi Shakti Puja and Sahasrara Puja in England, my son Omkar is a Sahasrara Puja baby. I told him, "At the Adi Shakti Puja, make sure you go and offer at Shri Mataji's feet." He said, "Okay, Mummy." He's very shy. He said he would go and then go to sleep. I was sitting very far back, so I couldn't see him. I asked, "Omkar, you went on stage?" He said, "Yes, Mummy, I went and offered Shri Mataji a flower." Three days later, I saw his photograph on the internet, offering her the flower. He actually offered Mother a flower, and a photograph was taken. Mother sometimes shows you what's going on.

What was it like for those public programs?

You were sort of slung in the deep end. The most amazing thing was how receptive people were. You were worried, "Did I know enough about the Kundalini and the chakras?" But they sat in front of you, and you did what Mother had showed you, and to your surprise, you felt this cool breeze. It was as much a surprise to you as it was to the person sitting there. You realized that you weren't doing this; Mother was doing it through you. This is how it's always been. It's got easier over the years. Today, at public programs, the moment people sit down, everyone gets the cool breeze. It's amazing how quick it is now. For me, it's the most fulfilling thing in my life. There's nothing more joyous than giving people their realization, because you feel as much as they do.

When was the first public program you had?

1982, on the island. We had the Red Cross Hall. We'd put posters all over the island. I suppose we had 70 or 80 people turn up. We'd have a quick talk, put on Mother's video, and then they all got their realization. The only problem was, very few stick on. They get their realization, and that's it.

In 1980, I was new. She asked Magda, who lived in Hampstead, to have a meeting there every week. As we were best friends, we did it together. In November, we had the first weekly meeting in the West, I believe. We started off with nine people, and after three weeks, we had so many we had to move down into the big hall. Of course, we were very new, so the older ones came and helped us a lot. We were terrified of standing up and talking, although we were actors. In the end, Mother was very scathing about actors who can act but can't stand up and talk. So we said, "Right, we've got to do this."

In the end, I did learn how to do it. It becomes very nice because you feel from your heart what people want to know. At that time, Mother used to come often to Hampstead. You'd get a phone call saying, "Mother's coming, Mother's coming!" I remember I was working on somebody, and Mother was standing next to me, showing me how to lift the Kundalini. She said, "This is like being in the fever hospital. We've got our hands in the pus, and we're getting rid of it." It was such a wonderful feeling. People used to walk across London to come, those who couldn't afford the fare. They were wonderful days at Hampstead.

She lived in various houses in London as well, didn't she?

Yes, she did. Ashley Gardens was the first one. Then there was Chelsham Road, Nightingale Lane, she lived in a flat in Hampstead, Brompton Square, Stafford Mansions, Rosary Gardens, Darwin Court... she lived all over the place.

Matthew, you were very young when you saw Shri Mataji and had this experience with God visiting your home. How did your friends relate to that? Did you speak to them about it?

I did. It's funny, saying something to people at school or the teachers, but I don't recall much. I think my relationships with my friends stayed the same, so I don't think I really communicated it to them. They're so spontaneous. Had they asked me a question, I probably would have answered. It wasn't something I wanted to put on them. I'd be more interested in the game that we were playing.

This is absolutely wonderful. I think this was a very, very nice afternoon. Thank you very much for sharing all your information.

Thank you.

If you would like to share some photographs or some tips, if you do, please let us know. It would help. If it's a memory that you can write, do email us. But if it's something that you think is very profound, we could also do a one-to-one interview.

If something comes to your attention, it would be perfect. And I think we'll also need your help in recognizing the Sahaja Yogis from that age. There are many who are not here today, so it would help us to... I have a photograph going up.
