 (England)
Well, I was in Sheffield at the time, studying Landscape Architecture. In retrospect, I think what happened is that I walked past this bookshop where they sold incense and all sorts of things. I walked back again because I saw a picture on the door of a lady with long hair. I read what was underneath—to this day I can't remember what it was—but I saw the picture, thought about it, and then just walked on and forgot all about it.

Before that, I would never have been someone who was looking for or reading anything unusual. I come from a very Christian background, and it was that incident of seeing Mother's picture that started me reading things and allowing myself to seek. I even went back and read the Bible as though I was reading it for my own sake, rather than anything else.

Then I came across a book by Gurdjieff, who was someone I'd never heard of. Inside, it said you need a guru. So I thought, "Oh my God, yes! I need a guru. That's what I need." So I was looking. I started going back to church, which I had stopped doing, and I went to the Baha'is because my brother was trying that. Finally, somebody in the house where I was living said, "We've gone to this thing. You'd be good at that. You're looking around and asking questions, you should come to this."

So we went to a program in Sheffield. Ray Harris was talking about evolution and everything, and I thought, "Oh, this is interesting." Then they put a tape of Mother on, and she started talking about how God made this beautiful world and put rivers here, trees there, and mountains here just to make it beautiful. I thought, "Hmm, that was interesting," because I was studying architecture and trying to design things. I thought, "Well, that sounds good."

Then I was worked on. I think it was John Glover and Graham's wife, Gail Pottinger. They worked on me, asking, "What are you feeling? What are you feeling? Are you feeling the cool breeze on your hands or on your head?" I couldn't feel anything on my head, and then I started to cry because I was in an emotional place at that time. Then they said, "But can you feel anything else?" I said, "Yes, I can feel this cool coming down on my knees." "Oh, that's good, that's good!"

Then I went home. Oh yes, and they asked me—Ray asked me—"Why do you think we're here?" I said, "We're here to enjoy." Strangely enough, before I'd come to the program, I had been sitting under a tree somewhere, thinking, "Why are we here?" And this thought had come into my head from somewhere: "We're here to enjoy." I was so not enjoying myself at that time, I thought it was very strange. Then Ray asked me the question, and when I answered, he said, "Yes, yes, yes! That's what we're here for. We're here to enjoy."

There was Mother's photograph at the meeting—it was a puja photo, actually—and I kept asking John Glover, "Yes, but who is this lady?" Coming from a Christian background, a photo like that is an icon, and I just kept wanting to know who this lady was.

A few months later, I think it was in the summer, we all went down to a puja in Chelsham Road. Mother was there, sitting next to the fireplace. I was almost at the back, and it was very tight with a million people around. I was just looking at Mother and asking in my mind, "Mother, who are you? Who are you?" Then I would go back home, look at Mother's photograph again, and think, "Well, I know who you are."

Then we went down to the next puja. It was the first puja where I went to Mother's feet when she asked for new people to come. She said, "What are you doing? Your liver's so bad." I said, "Architecture, or landscape architecture." She told me to say, "Mother, you are the architect of all architects," three times. And suddenly, you feel it's all sort of cleared out.

After the second puja, I asked her about the Baha'is, and she said, "Well, they do drink and smoke." I thought that was an interesting answer. I knew that because my brother was a Baha'i and he couldn't give up smoking. After coming back from that puja, I just felt, "Well, I just love you." And that was really it for me.

Later on, I went to a meeting at somebody's house, and Mrs. Harris, Ray's mum, was there. There was this big photo of Mother in the blue sari, and people were talking about Shri Mataji. Mrs. Harris just sat there and said, "Well, they do say she might be the Virgin Mary." And I sort of thought, "Yes." I took this on board and thought, "Yes, this is a possibility." And I think that was it, really.
