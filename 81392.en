 (England)
That was quite long. Yes. Couldn't stop it anyway. I tried a few times, but it happened when it was meant to by Shri Mataji.

So, in today's session, which is very different from what we've had so far, we have Felicity in Devon. Hi, Felicity. And we have Shankarji here sitting beside me. The interview is going to be taken by Felicity. A lot of things in common here. So, I'd request Felicity to take over, please.

Felicity: So nice to be with you both. I'm looking forward to hearing... You were sharing a little bit, Shankarji, about how you first got your realisation, and from this area where I am in Noss Mayo in Devon, on the river near Plymouth in the south part of England, next to Cornwall. A very ancient part of the land. I'm looking forward to hearing you share your stories, and I know also that we're going to hear something about Shri Ganesha as well. So, if you would like to start the story of your seeking and how you came into Sahaja Yoga.

Shankarji: Hi. Hello, everybody. I'm very proud to be allowed to tell my story. I have just jumped in on a vacant slot in the interview. I feel sad for your brother in Australia, Alex Henshaw, who couldn't make it this morning, so I've been kindly invited to jump in. I hope you enjoy what I've got to say, and I hope some of you out there can relate to what I'm going to say.

It's very hard to explain how the divine works. All I can say is that one has to just marvel at the mysticism, the miracles, and the magic of the divine, which I understand essentially comes from Shri Ganesha. But you'll discover that for yourselves as you meditate more and lead out your lives as realised souls.

Basically, it's quite amazing that Felicity's in Noss Mayo. It's a small coastal village opposite another village across the creek, Newton Ferrers. And it was in Newton Ferrers, when I was sitting in front of the TV, that my journey began. I was staying at a mate's house because I wasn't faring very well. I was a young man following the premature death of my parents in the space of two years of each other. My mum passed on in 1983, and my dad followed her in 1986. I was 21 when my mum went and 23 when my dad went. I don't have any brothers and sisters. I did have a brother; he died at 18 months, and I think I must have been about nine at the time.

When my mum and dad passed away, my world just fell apart. I bottled it up for a while, trying to keep a brave face on it, stiff upper lip and all that, in typically English fashion. But in the end, I succumbed to about four years of manic depression, which totally threw me out. The GP that I visited in Plymouth at the time diagnosed my condition. He said, "Paul, you've been suffering manic depression." I just couldn't believe what was going on with me, and I was feeling very lost in the world.

I had two Plymouth Poly friends then that were very supportive, but I couldn't relate to life anymore. I couldn't relate to mainstream life. I couldn't get any satisfaction materially, despite the fact that I'd inherited some tens of thousands of pounds from my late parents' estate. That didn't give me any sense of satisfaction or well-being whatsoever.

I was living out at Loddiswell—or as the locals call it, Lodzall. It's not far from Noss Mayo, just up from Kingsbridge in that lovely part of South Hams, South Devon, where you are, Felicity. I had a panic attack in Kingsbridge Post Office. I just fell apart badly. I just went in there to buy some stamps. God forbid anybody experiences manic depression, but it's very black, very dark, and you just can't get out of the hole that you're in. I was really very lonely. As a young man, not doing well at all.

Luckily, the French gentleman that was sharing a house with me in Loddiswell rescued me in his old Mark 2 Ford Cortina and pulled me out of the post office. I was a gibbering wreck under the dashboard on the way back. Then I went to stay with a good friend in Newton Ferrers, across the creek, and I started to try and stabilise a bit. I got a fish supervisor's job in Tesco's at Lee Mill, just on the southern fringe of Dartmoor, but all the white tiles around the fish counter made me feel like I was in a loony bin or something. So, I jacked that job in pretty quickly.

And it was then, in that period of staying at Newton Ferrers, I was watching TV through the day. I don't usually watch TV through the day, but for some reason, I had a bit of time on my hands. There was a documentary on the Kumbh Mela, covering where the Yamuna River, the Ganga, and the mythical Sarasvati come together—the confluence. I think it was one of the big ones that happens every 12 years. There were lots of sadhus, sannyasis, and Hindu pilgrims going to the Kumbh Mela.

They had some Shaivite sadhu babas, and they've got all the ash on their faces and the red kumkum, big tilaks, matted hair, loincloths, orange garb, and Rudraksha beads. I was watching it on TV, and some of them had got their hands up. They'd performed tapas, or penance, to please God Almighty—Shri Shiva to the Hindus. The fingernails were really long, and they couldn't bring their arm down because it had locked in position for 15 years. It was real hardcore, a bit extreme. I suppose on the Christian level, one would compare it to monks and their retreats or hermitages.

I was just totally taken with it. I was looking for the answer to life, the meaning of life. I was going to go travelling in South America, but after I saw this documentary, I thought, "No. I've got to go there. I've got to go to India. I've got to go and check out what these sadhus are doing. This is it. I'm going for this."

So, I bought myself a mountain bike. I was planning to cycle from Delhi to Sydney, Australia—obviously, I'd get the ferry over the water. I graduated from Plymouth Poly in 1986, where I did a geography degree, and I went off to India in 1990, four years later. After that four years of darkness, I was raring to go. I wanted to know what the meaning of life was. My world had fallen apart, apart from my good friends and my dear aunt and uncle from Bedfordshire that really looked after me.

I was on the plane to Delhi with my mountain bike. I’d nipped into Waterstones in Plymouth, looking for books on spirituality, and I found a book about the Kundalini. I thought, "That's what I need to do. I need to get my Kundalini raised. And the only place I can do that is India." Having seen this documentary, I was off.

I jumped on the plane, landed in Delhi, and got on my mountain bike out of the airport. Within cycling about a mile, I ended up in a false guru's ashram. So, within hours of getting off the plane, I was ardently seeking. But I'd found myself in a false guru's ashram. I didn't know that at the time. Being innocent to it all, I got a little bit sucked in for a couple of weeks.

Then something within me was pushing me on. So I cycled out of Delhi towards Jaipur on my mountain bike, on the busy roads, and I ended up living with a Brahmin family, the Sharma family, in a Shri Krishna temple in Jaipur, just around from the Palace of the Winds. I ended up living with them for six months and pretty much became a member of the family. I used to go to the local Shiva mandir with the head of the household, Mr. Sharmaji, and we used to attend the puja to Shri Shiva.

I was so taken with his name, Shankar, that I thought, "Yeah, that's a great name." It resonated with me. I didn't have any middle names then because my mum and dad had really long middle names and they didn't really like them.

Felicity: What is the meaning of Shankar?

Shankarji: I think it means the one that has compassion. So, I bought myself a conch and I was blowing that in the Shri Krishna temple. I was coming away in the auto-rickshaw with Mr. Sharma and I thought, "Shankar. I love the sound of that name. I'd like to have that as a middle name."

When I returned to the UK, I actually changed my name formally by deed poll. I put it into my British passport: Paul Shankar Sharma Westbrook. It wasn't until after realisation and listening to Shri Mataji's talks much later on that I understood she had commented that anyone with the name Paul, Pauline, or Paula should consider changing it. And I thought, "Oh, wow. That's amazing." The Sharma bit was in respect to this lovely Hindu family that took me on board. Which is why people who practice Sahaja Yoga in the UK know me as Shankar, but otherwise, to others, I'm known as Paul.

I went into quite a few babas' ashrams in Rajasthan to try and get my Kundalini raised. In short, I ended up in one near Sariska Tiger Reserve, between Alwar and Jaipur. I went and stayed at that ashram. I lived in a little stone hut with a slate roof. You're such a seeker. I had all the orange garb, the kurta pyjamas, and I'd got the big tilak on my forehead, the Rudraksha beads and all that.

One morning at that ashram, we were drawing up water from the well. I remember sitting outside the boundary of the ashram, and this was part of the magic of India. One of the Maharajas of Alwar, maybe a hundred and fifty years ago, had come to visit the baba on his elephant. The baba invited him into the ashram, but the Maharaja refused to dismount because the elephant couldn't get through the gates. So the baba teleported the Maharaja and the elephant, with him on it, into the ashram. There's a little marble plaque outside the pedestrian gate that tells the story in Hindi script, and that was translated to me. That whole magic of India—the babas, the sadhus, chanting Om—you really got the whole spiritual experience.

I remember one desperate morning there, though. Outside the ashram, while I was squatting down, just looking out at the valley, I thought, "That's it." I said to myself, "Paul, you're going to step out into India and just disappear." I was just about to do it. I was going to renounce everything: the money I'd inherited from my parents, my aunt and uncle, my mates from Plymouth Poly, my mountain bike. I was just going to step out into India and find God. And so, something said inside me, "Don't do it." So I didn't. I turned around and went back into the ashram, and I'm so glad I did. I'd be dead if I'd have gone out into India with nothing.

When my friend, Mr. Sharma's son Arun, came up to pick me up from my stay there, he could speak English, but the baba couldn't. We were all sitting in front of the baba, and he had a translator. He asked Arun in Hindi what I was doing there. I said, "Well, I've come to get my Kundalini raised." The baba said, "I can't do it." He couldn't do it. He showed me an asana, and I tried it, and it didn't work.

Part of the manic depression was that my left side became quite numb. It freezes. I'd gone so much into the emotional left side, the lunar channel, that it had frozen over. Because the right side, the frenetic seeking, it kept pushing the left. This probably won't make any sense at all to anyone that's not a realised soul or a yogi listening, but hopefully one day they'll get it.

Felicity: It's amazing how much your experience mirrored mine. I went off to India; I was going to Australia but got stuck in India for six months, travelling around, looking for a guru in the mountains, wanting to find God. I had this deep desire, "That's it, I want to feel this joy with God." And then it was after that that I got the realisation. I was the same; I had this frozen left side. So I understand exactly where you're coming from. Please continue.

Shankarji: After not getting my realisation in India, I ended up in a couple of other babas' ashrams. But I had Giardia for four months, and it forced me back to England.

Felicity: Remind me again, what is Giardia?

Shankarji: A gut parasite. An intestinal... so you were physically having problems. I was really sick. The trouble is with Giardia, you can feel okay for a couple of days, and then... When you're sick in India, it's not a good place to be ill. It’s interesting, because for people that have just got their self-realisation, or haven't yet, the void—the guts, where the Giardia has its effects—is that void area, the Bhavasagara. It’s part of the seeking, and it's quite interesting how it's all linked up.

Anyway, I got back to England with my mountain bike. It was late winter, blooming cold, freezing, and I didn't have any winter clothes. I cycled from Heathrow Airport to another Plymouth Poly mate's flat in Northolt, West London. It was bitterly cold, I was not well, and when I got outside his flat, he wasn't in. I doubled up for about an hour on the communal corridor, and eventually, his girlfriend came back and let me in. I was back in England. Central heating, double glazing, carpet on the floors, baked beans, fish and chips. I felt I was home in that sense. The creature comforts of Western living came flooding back.

I went to stay with my grandad in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. My grandad saw me with my mountain bike on his front doorstep and was so shocked at the state of me. He took me straight down to his GP, who diagnosed Giardia. The GP gave me a two-week course of Amoxicillin, and I was cured. What's ironic is I had Amoxicillin in my saddlebag in India and I never took it. But it was all meant to be, to bring you back.

While I was in Jaipur for six months, I never got to Australia. But other than seeking, I'd bought about six grand's worth of Indian handicrafts. It transpired into 26 cardboard boxes with hessian sacking sewn around them, sent back on a cargo flight to my poor old grandad's council house in Borehamwood. He opens the door the next day, and there's this man with 26 boxes that I'm manhandling up his stairs into his spare room, hoping his floor doesn't collapse. My grandad was so patient with me. He was a real working-class man, retired. That's what grandparents do for their grandkids—unconditional love.

Once he'd got me back on my feet physically, I went back to Plymouth. One of the people that I was staying with in Plymouth had an ethnic incense boutique in the "House that Jack Built." She was going to do the festivals around the UK—the folk festivals, the new age festivals—as a trader. I'd got 26 boxes of Indian stuff, so I said, "I'll come in with you." I bought myself an old British Gas Leyland DAF long-wheelbase Transit van, and we loaded up all our stuff and hit the festivals for the summer season. This would be the summer of 1990. We did them all: Strawberry Fair in Cambridge, WOMAD festivals, and ultimately, Glastonbury.

I was trading out of the van up in the Green Fields. At the end of the festival, which of course is a complete binge of drugs, drink, and music, I noticed in the corner of the field a Bedford TK horse box. It was for sale. So I walked over and introduced myself to the traveller who owned it. He said, "A thousand pounds." I was a bit gullible; I said, "I'll buy it," because I thought, "This is it. I'm going to live in that." I hadn't got my realisation, and I was still seeking, still disillusioned. I still wasn't happy.

Felicity: There's something missing inside. You want to get out into nature; you want to become one with nature.

Shankarji: Mentally, I think I wasn't mad, but there might have been elements of crazy.

Felicity: I think it's more that you're seeking so deeply, and you'll try anything that might get you to that place. You're just travelling around and you know you want this thing, this connection with the divine. It sits there and it gnaws at you, like a hunger. The beauty of it is that, in the same way with Buddha, he also had this really circuitous route before he finally sat down under the tree and kind of just gave up. And then boom, the Kundalini comes up. In some part of the journey, on a subtle level, we're also growing and maturing so you get to that point where you're finally ready for it. So that when it happens to you, it just goes, "Bing, now this is it." You can recognize it. So please continue. You buy the horse box.

Shankarji: I always had a sense of a higher being. I had a sense that the universe was looking after me, that I was going to be all right.

Felicity: Me too. It's so interesting. For me also, I had severe depression from family things that had happened, which led into anorexia. And yet, through it all, I always felt this little tunnel of light, this sense of hope that at some point this would all be done with. You would get what you needed.

Shankarji: And the soul persists in seeking to become the spirit, which is the reflection of the divine in your heart. And the divine hand, it turns you.

Felicity: In the same way, when you were in that field and you said, "Okay, I'm chucking everything in," and then the voice comes in, "Don't do it." You know that's the right voice to listen to.

Shankarji: I'll say this, my wife's never heard this. That voice that said no... I very nearly threw myself off the cliffs in South Devon, at Sawmill Cove. I really did. I was about to, and then this voice came in, and I stepped back. So just to tell people out there, if they're ever in that state, don't do it. Things will get better.

Felicity: It's so difficult with depression because it feels so incredibly real, and you feel that you're never going to get out of this blackness. It's like you're drowning. You're just trying to hold on.

Shankarji: So I bought this old Bedford TK horse box. It's a small truck, about five and a half tons, with a wooden mahogany box on the back. It had no brakes. I was driving it back from Glastonbury, down Exeter Hill on the A38. Luckily, I managed to get it down to the car park in Noss Mayo. That was touch and go.

At that time, I'd found accommodation in Noss Mayo. The mother of the young lady I was sharing with was married to a farmer who was a tenant of the National Trust up on the headland. You follow the coast path out, you wrap around the headland where you can see Wembury and the Mewstone. He said, "You can park your truck up on one of my fields." And I did. I parked it up there, did the truck up, and I was all ready to live in it. I was going on the road full time then.

But what I needed was a cooking pot, a cast iron cauldron that I could have on a tripod over an open fire. I didn't have one. So I got the bus into Plymouth. I remembered there's an antique shop down there on the Barbican. I'd walked past this antique shop on and off for four years while I was at Plymouth Poly, but I never went in. Funny enough, it's near the House that Jack Built. I always looked, but I never went in. I plucked up courage, I went in, and I walked into the shop. There was no one else in there, and there were antiques everywhere. I walked down the central aisle, and at the end was this black pot on the floor.

I thought, "That's it." I bent down and I picked it up. As I was lifting the pot up, I noticed on an antique writing desk a pile of photocopies about Sahaja Yoga. I picked one up. It was the one with Shri Mataji's hands, a miracle photograph. It said, "Sahaja Yoga, the gentle path. Get your Kundalini raised in minutes." And I'm going, "That's not possible. I've just been to India for six months for that. You can't do that."

Then Margaret popped her head from around the corner. She's the proprietor, dear Margaret Parker. God bless her soul, she gave me my realisation. She said, "Can I help you?" I said, "Yeah, how much is the pot?" Then I pointed at the leaflet and said to Margaret, "That's not possible." She said, "Yes. You come on Thursday in the evening. You get yourself a realisation." I couldn't believe it. So I bought my pot, hopped and skipped out of the shop, and back on the bus to my truck.

My only attachment was tobacco. I was starting to wean myself off it just a couple of days before self-realisation. Anyway, I went back on Thursday evening. The pubs were just opening up, the Barbican was just coming alive. I was down there with my white kurta pyjamas, my multi-coloured leather shoes from Totnes, and my "Jai Shri Ram" shawl. The shop was closed, with the iron gates across. I'm thinking, "What's going on?" And then I saw a little photograph of Shri Mataji. This is the first time I saw her face. I thought, "Ah, right. This is it now. She's the guru."

So I went 'round the Ope, the alleyway at the side, and knocked on the side door. Margaret came to the head of the stairs and said, "Oh, hello. Come in. Go upstairs." I'm sidling up the staircase, got all her bric-a-brac and her stock hanging up, and then I went into the meditation room. This was the magic of it all. I think my soul, and the way I was seeking, Mother had created this magic, that curiosity that I needed to help me recognise this was the right thing.

I walked into the meditation room. It was partitioned off nicely with Indian wooden carved screens and drapes. Classic 1970s hippie style, I loved it, with that patchouli fragrance. On top of an old TV was a photograph of Shri Mataji, and she was waving into the room. I waved back at the photo. I thought, "I must be mad," but I just waved back.

Margaret sat me down, and her niece came. They put me in front of a video of Shri Mataji giving a self-realisation talk. She's dressed in white, on a stage. I followed it, and Margaret and her niece, Janet, were working on me from the back. I just felt this relief, and the weight of the world just fell off my shoulders.

Felicity: That's what I experienced too. I was like, "Wow." I'd never felt peaceful in my entire life.

Shankarji: They said, "Put your hand above your head." I put my hand up here, and what was called the Kundalini just pushed my hand away. It was like a fountain. That physical feeling, when you've got to feel the cool wind of the divine, or the Ruah, or the Paramchaitanya—you've got to feel that coming out. Then you get it.

Felicity: It's tangible.

Shankarji: I got my realisation in an antique shop in Plymouth. You had to come back home. It was on the doorstep all along the line. I did about three months with Margaret. She was so kind and patient with me. I can only thank her enough. She was the perfect instrument for me. She brought me up to see and meet Shri Mataji at Heathrow Airport. And that's when, the first time, I met Shri Mataji.

Felicity: What was that like, when you saw her in person?

Shankarji: We jumped in a little brown Ford Fiesta and drove up to Heathrow. We got out of the car, and I started to see all these beautiful people moving in the same direction, carrying flowers. We got down to the front of the Queen's Building, and there was this gathering of what are called Sahaja Yogis, or realised souls. I'd never met them before.

Shri Mataji came. They brought her very nicely, very respectfully, in a wheelchair, because the walks from the terminals are a long way. This swarm of yogis was converging and moving with her. The beautiful countenance on these people's faces—I've never seen human beings like this. It was like, wow, glowing. So peaceful. No one was smoking, no one was dropping litter. I was standing right at the back with my little red rose, my white pyjama bottoms, my red fleece, and my little multi-coloured leather shoes.

After a while, a lot of yogis had greeted Mother, and it was my turn. All of a sudden, I was in front of Shri Mataji. I was just off to her side, and she looked up at me. I offered my little rose and I said, "Dhanyavad," which is "thank you" in Hindi, to thank her for rescuing me. She didn't say anything; I don't even think she smiled. But she looked up at me for a moment, and I looked at her face. My soul just knew that she was saying, "Ah, so you've finally turned up, have you?" I just melted. Thank you, Mother. She knew she'd reeled me in.

Felicity: You'd finally got there. It was a big thing for me as well because I was looking out for a male guru.

Shankarji: Because that's what we thought. We all thought it had to be a male. I think it's because in the Western Christian tradition, God is male. There is not the worship of the female Adi Shakti, or power.

Felicity: Having Shri Mataji as the Mother was so beautiful and so desirable, actually, as a guru. It was just such a relief that, one, she wasn't a man, so there would be no hanky-panky business. And two, because she's a woman and she's a mother. Of course, the vibrations are the proof of everything, but she's a real householder. She hasn't renounced the home and the family.

Shankarji: After meeting Shri Mataji, of course, I still had my seeking head on. I went back to Plymouth with Margaret. I'd got my cooking pot, got my Bedford TK all fitted out, and then I was off. I was living on the road. I decided to take it to Brittany. I jumped on the Brittany Ferries from Millbay Docks, a six-hour sailing out to Roscoff. I wanted to give realisation to travellers.

Felicity: When you get your realisation, you're so grateful and you feel like, "Wow, this is so fantastic." You want to share it so other people can experience this.

Shankarji: Because I was coming from that sort of wayward, seeking, on-the-fringes-of-society, non-conformist background, to attend a weekly meeting with 20 or 30 other realised souls wouldn't have cut it with me. I was still on that crazy railroad.

I was on the road, living in my truck. I got my little wood-burning stove inside. I was selling my Indian handicrafts out the back of the truck to the French in Brittany as I drove 'round. In my travels, I decided to buy a smallholding in Brittany because at the time, property was dirt cheap. I chanced upon a granite construction, a bit like a Devon longhouse, with about two or three acres. I bought it for 15 grand. Bargain.

But I couldn't live in it because it needed doing up, so I was still living in the truck on the land. I was really in that bliss-bunny stage, where you're really feeling the cool vibrations and getting into thoughtless awareness. You get this six-month honeymoon period. You're invincible.

Something inside me was going, "There's more than this. There's more than this, Paul." I knew about Cabella. Margaret had mentioned it, but I didn't know where it was.

One night, and I'm pretty sure it was a full moon, I was in a fairly remote part of Brittany. I was meditating one evening. I had mounted Shri Mataji's photo inside the horse box by the wood-burning stove, and I collected flowers from the hedgerows and put them on it. I was about 28 or 29. It was a very quiet night, wood-burning stove on, Mother's photo, a little candle on the table. I was just settling down for meditation.

Things started to get a bit intense in my being. Then I heard this quite loud and distinctive thud, like big, heavy footsteps around the horse box. I was sitting there with my eyes closed and I was thinking, "What's that?" While meditating, I saw Shri Mataji come to the little side door of the horse box and want to come in. I'm thinking, "Well, how's she going to get in? She's not going to be able to reach the step." So, in my meditation, though my body was still, my attention zoomed out. I turned on all fours, and she put her foot on my back and stepped up into the truck. Then I whizzed back to where I was sitting.

My body didn't shake, but there were a couple of big tremors going through me. Really powerful stuff, enough for me to go, "Whoa, what's going on?" I opened my eyes and looked to one side where the entrance was. Floating, about a meter and a half across, was a bluey-white, smoky apparition of a body with an elephant's head on it. I knew Shri Ganesha from going to India. It was hovering and moving back and forth, suspended in mid-air.

I was really scared. I shut my eyes immediately—too much. Then, when I'd shut my eyes, I saw that she had gone out and was checking out the farm. I'm pretty sure she was wearing a green and red sari with a gold border. She was looking at everything. And then, after a while, these two great forces came together in the ploughed field. It was a moonlit night. I saw it through my meditation. I could only imagine it was Shri Ganesha and Shri Mataji coming together. And then, whoosh, off they went, up into the night sky.

I got out of the horse box and I was bricking it. I was very scared, trembling. I was walking around the farm saying up to the divine, "Can you do this to me? I can't cope with this. This is too much."

A couple of days later, it came into my head: "I've got to go to Cabella." I don't know where it is in Northern Italy, but I've got to go. I was on the public phone box in the local village to Margaret. I said, "Margaret, I've had this experience. I've got to go and see Shri Mataji in Cabella. Where is it?" She said, "Oh, it's just south of Milan, in the Ligurian mountain range, between Milan and Genoa."

The next day, I packed up the truck. I was on the road. It took me just over two weeks to get to Cabella, doing 40 miles an hour in a 30-year-old Bedford TK horse box. There was no GPS, I didn't even have a mobile phone. On the way, I was selling my handicrafts out the back of my truck to get money for diesel. I was doing the back roads; the truck was only doing 45 miles an hour downhill with the wind behind you.

I didn't know the way. As I was getting closer to Italy, I needed to know where Cabella was, and I didn't have enough money for a map. I remember I was in Grenoble, and I walked into a bookshop. I pulled out a map and I had to feel with the vibrations where Cabella was. I put my hand over the map, and there was this pinprick of cool coming up. I looked and it said, "Cabella Ligure." I couldn't afford the map, so I remembered the route, put the map back, and got back in the truck.

I went via Nice, round the Med to Genoa. I was selling Balinese bikinis on Nice beach to get some money. Through Monte Carlo, with all the super yachts and Ferraris, in this old Bedford TK. It was amazing how the divine protects you when you're on a pilgrimage.

Finally, I got to Cabella Ligure. I got pulled over by the police; they thought I was a drug smuggler, they had machine guns on me. They saw I was a waste of space. I got into Cabella and I'm looking around for this big castle. It was before all the external repairs were done. I saw it, parked up by the riverbed, and walked up. I knocked on the front door of the castle. An Indian yogini came out in a sari. I said, "I've come to see Shri Mataji." She said, "Oh, very good, but she's not here." I said, "What do you mean she's not here?" "No, she's in London. She's coming back shortly." And then she shut the door.

So I went back to my truck. Later on, I met John Watkinson and Padmini, and I helped John out a little bit with the work he was doing for Shri Mataji. I stayed and waited for her to come back.

Felicity: And she also told you something about Devon, wasn't there?

Shankarji: Oh yeah, this is where we'll end it. After some weeks of helping John, Shri Mataji came back from the UK.

Felicity: How beautiful that you got to spend that time in Cabella. Your being would get cleared and opened so that when you did see Mother again, you could appreciate her presence more.

Shankarji: Courtesy of John's mustard oil head massages down in the dungeons of the castle where he had his ornate plaster workshop. He poured about two and a half litres of mustard oil all over my head. It was going in my eyes, and he was just bashing away at my head, clearing out my Sahasrara chakra. This was big vibrations.

So, Shri Mataji's car pulled up at the rear of the castle. We were all lined up on the bridge. I borrowed a pair of jeans from John. Someone had given me a rose to offer. John and Padmini were up by the door that leads into the castle. Everybody preparing to welcome Mother home.

Mother's coming along, and she's accepting the flowers. She came to me and she took my flower. I'd just been painting. She said, "Hello! How are you?" I went, "I've been painting, Mother." I was a bit heady from the solvent fumes of the gloss paint. I could just see John down the other end of the bridge, out of the corner of my eye, just cracking up laughing at this ridiculous reply I'd given. She just dismissed me with a wave of her hand. She went, "Ha!" and just went on down the line. To me, it just felt like a dismissal. I've always felt the divine has got a great sense of humour.

We all filed into Mother's reception room. I was probably the last one to come in. I did namaskar at her feet. I got up, and she said, "Where are you from?" I went, "Well, I live in a truck, Mother, on the side of the road. It's your truck, Mother, I've given it to you." She said, "Yes, yes, I know that. But where are you from?" "Oh, I've just driven through France, really." "Yes, yes, yes, I know that. But where are you from?"

Then she turned to Sandeep, attending her, and said, "Look at his hair." He was blonde then, and I had a bit more of it. She said, "Look at his hair, you know, it's almost as if... where's he from? Scandinavia or somewhere." Then she turned back to me and said, "But yes, where are you from?" I didn't know what to say, so I said, "Plymouth, in Devon, Mother."

And she went, "Ah!" Big smile on her face. She said to the yogis all around, "They say Devon is heaven, but I've never been there," with a big chuckle. And I went, "Yes, Mother." Because I knew she had been there. She'd done an interview with Spotlight South West in Plymouth, she'd been to Exeter Cathedral. I just went, "Yes, Mother." And she had a big smile. So every time I go back to Devon, I tell the family in the car, "Devon is heaven." That's that bit of it all, for now.

What I've realised is, we thank Shri Mataji, our Guru, the Adi Shakti, but in more recent years it's clocked: come on, Shankar, you've got to thank God the Father as well, Shri Mahadev, Shri Sadashiva. So every time I do namaskar now, I thank my Father and of course my Mother, Shri Mataji, for everything. I love the whole magic. It's fantastic, and I just wish that every human being could experience that magic and know that there is a Divine.

Mother took me from a potentially half-mad seeker with a third-class geography degree and she's turned me into a building surveyor. She took me from nothing to a professional. I wear a shirt now! It's great.

Felicity: It's been a big life journey. It's so special. It was so lovely to be part of this journey with you and so interesting to see how many parallels there were in your seeking journey to my own. And very generous of you to share what it's like to go through manic depression. Maybe next time we can talk a little bit more about how the meditation helped with that in a practical, physical way. We want to share that whatever problem or difficulty you come from, this amazingly beautiful energy that comes through the Kundalini awakening will comfort, support, and heal all those things.

Thank you so much. We look forward to the second session with other stories that you obviously have. Shankar, when you share, you have so much colourful, visual detail, I feel like I'm going through a film with you. You've got all the material to write memoirs.

Shankarji: Thank God for God is what I say.

Felicity: Trust in yourself and trust in the divine. That's the main thing.

Host: Thank you so much, Felicity, for taking this interview with my husband, Shankarji. It's really nice to hear it. It's interesting because just last Saturday, a Yuva was saying his mum has been chasing him to interview him. It's really nice that this has happened just the following time, just spontaneously. How Shri Mataji works things out, isn't it? Thank you so much for your time.

All: Jai Shri Mataji. Thank you so much for everything.
