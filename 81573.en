 (England)
I was always a seeker, from early childhood. I remember when I was a kid, someone asked me, "What do you want to do when you grow up?"—expecting me to say "marry a rich man," because that's what people of my background were supposed to do. And I said, "I want to find God. I want to give that wisdom of God to others." Of course, they thought I was quite mad.

When I was a bit older, there's that wonderful story in the Bible where Lord Jesus gets left behind in the temple. He has these discussions with the people there, and his family can't find him. And he says, "Wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?" That also was very much my mantra as a child. I was always seeking, even when I was 10 or 12 years old. I think I'm probably the oldest person in the room here.

I grew up just after the Second World War, and I remember the first things I ever saw in the newspaper were these photos of atom bombs going off. If you grew up with that being drummed into your head—the fact that we were about to go bang—and we used to have these lectures at school about what to do when the bomb went off... if you were a thinking person, it did something to you. I think that was one of the things that caused the whole hippie generation. We realized something had to give, something had to change. An awful lot of us grew up feeling that way.

So, I thought I was going to find realization—I was always looking for Self-Realization. I thought I was going to find it at university, so I had a go at philosophy at London University. Luckily, my professor was a very sensible man. He said, "You're looking for a philosophy of life. You will never find it at London University. Go and do a degree that doesn't impinge on your seeking." I remember him actually using that word, "seeking."

Well, then things went from bad to worse because, unfortunately, everybody basically got caught by something. I got caught by drugs, and I got caught by false gurus. I got caught by the TM. But I realized in about 1978 that it was wrong. By that time, I had this place in Scotland which had actually been an academy where they did all these ghastly things. But anyway, we kicked these people out. And I was desperately, desperately seeking and went to an astrologer. Not something I'd usually do, but I was pretty desperate at that time. I was a bit like John with his macrobiotics and stuff; I was trying everything.

This guy was really strange because he said, "Is there any question you want to ask?" And I said, "Yes, I want to know if I'll ever get my Self-Realization in this lifetime." He looked at the chart—he was an Indian Vedic astrologer—and he said, "Yes. June the 8th next year."

So I kind of forgot about that. Then I was reading—like Fergie, I just got all the scriptures out and went through them one by one. I was reading the Srimad Devi Bhagavatam, which is the stories of the Goddess. At this time, I had a £350,000 bankruptcy court case against me because we'd kicked the TM people out, and they'd ripped us off big time and were trying to bankrupt us. I read these words: "If you say these three names of the Goddess, help will come within a day."

The next day, a letter came through the post. I was living in Perthshire, Scotland. It was a letter from David Prole with a photograph of Shri Mataji, the classic photo. He just said, "You must come and see this lady. She is your only hope." He hadn't actually met Mother, but he'd been to a public program in Caxton Hall. He also enclosed a cheque for the train fare, saying, "Because I know you haven't got any money." This was pretty nice of David because he was also going through bankruptcy. Bankruptcy seemed to be the name of the game for us at that time. So there was David, who'd given me his last £35.

Well, things got interesting after that. I had to take the train from Rannoch Moor, which was a funny little station on the West Highland line, down to Glasgow. Then I had to change stations. I was due to meet Mother at the home of Maria, the Greek lady, just outside Bedford. I had to get the train to Birmingham, and then I was going to be taken to her house.

So, I get to Rannoch station. There was this one man who was the porter, the station master, and everything else combined, in the middle of the moor at this tiny station. I said, "I've got to get to Birmingham." And he said, "Well, you're not going to make it, because the train from Fort William is three-quarters of an hour late. It's going to be later by the time it gets to Glasgow." I said, "I've just got to make that train. It's a really important meeting."

So he said, "Well, don't worry. I'm the station master of Rannoch, although I'm the only person here. I'll ring up Glasgow, the station for the trains going south, and I'll tell them that there's a really important person and that you've got to hold the train." This was in the days when British Rail owned the railways, and they did not hold trains for nobody.

Anyway, I get to Glasgow and take a taxi across to the other station. The ticket collector said, "Are you the lady from Rannoch?" I said, "Yes." He said, "You get on that train. They'll have your guts for garters if they know who you are." This entire express train had been held up for an hour for me. So at this point, I knew something unusual was happening.

Then I got to Birmingham station, and Balan Kanesan picked me up. He had this funny little red Mini, which he had in those days, and he drove me very sweetly and kindly to Maria's house. It was a lovely summer day—June the 8th, of course. I didn't realise this until afterwards.

I remember the door of her living room was open. It was a small living room, smaller than this. We went there for Ganesh Puja in '82. Anyway, she had a sort of garden door at the back. I remember Felicity was there, and I was sort of hovering at the back. I just looked at Mother. She was sitting on the sofa with the window behind her, and she was wearing a beautiful red sari. She had so much hair in those days. I just remember thinking, "My God, this is who I've been looking for all my life. What went wrong? Where did I get sidetracked?" I just thought, "This is the one."
