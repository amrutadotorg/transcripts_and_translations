I bow to all the seekers of Truth.  Truth is everlasting and eternal in its place. We cannot change it, nor can we increase it. What is, will remain, it was that, and will be that. Truth cannot be defined because unless we experience the Truth, we cannot understand it. And those who have not sought the Truth and those who seek only falsehood, they cannot even understand the Truth. But Truth is a very small, sparkling, special, wonderful thing. The Truth is that we are all the Spirit. We are not this body, intellect, mind, ego, etc. but the Eternal Spirit. I have found a big difference between the Indian culture or should say the Eastern culture and the Western culture.

Those who are Westerners may not even be so aware of the Spirit. Although they believe in Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ was born in Asia. The total perception, or the total attention of those people, is drawn towards perishable things, which in a moment, (UNCLEAR). But if one talks to the people of the East, where there have been great knowers of the principles of Vedas, seers, sages, saints, incarnations, all of them will say that man should seek only such eternal things, which are imperishable. And that indestructible, eternal thing is the Spirit. Unless man seeks those things, he cannot know the Absolute Truth. You cannot know the Absolute Truth through the intellect. That is why the question of all the religions has arisen today. When you apply your intellect to something, then it goes in any direction. Every person thinks that only I am correct.

The founders of every religion have said the same thing, but their followers think that only they are right. Similarly, in politics, some people say that imperialism is right, Some say socialism(samvaad) is right, some say communism is right. A number of these 'isms' and the very meaning of these 'isms' is that it's something we have created out of our intellect. If we have to rise above the intellect and want to know the Truth, whether or not we have any system for it within us, has been discussed in every religion. But in India, because our climate was quite good and we could live even in the forests, thus a lot of thought has been given to this since times immemorial. And the Sahaja Yoga I'm going to explain to you today, is not something new that I'm talking about. The Nathpanthis in India also knew about this. On one hand, attention was paid to the Vedas, etc. and the word Ved also comes from the word Vid. Vid means to know, but not to know through the intellect.

But knowing on your Central Nervous System, should be called Vid. Similarly, Buddha's bodh is also to be aware. People say, "Buddham Sharanam Gachhami." Means that the person who has attained enlightenment is the Buddha. And all of His work was that first of all you should attain Self-Realization. After that, in another thing, there is a great deal of devotion in our country. Even those who are in devotion, there's Krishna, so even when Krishna induced Gita, so primarily, when people worship Krishna, they still do it blindly. Krishna has explained very well in the Gita, but we have not been able to read what is deep within It. For example, firstly He advised to become Sthithapragya (a person of steady state of consciousness). This means that you should become a Sahaja Yogi.

But how does that happen? So He said, 'Now attain knowledge.' Meaning that we should have knowledge about our Central Nervous system. Just as we can feel hot and cold, similarly we can understand sin and virtue. We can find out who is good, who is bad, who is important and who is genuine/truthful. The second thing He said was, "Whatever deed you do, leave it to God." We just cannot do this. We can say like this for ourselves, 'Whatever actions we perform, we leave them to God.' But this is not possible because whatever work a person does, there are two blessings in it. Even a father will say, "I worked for my son."

The mother will say, "I did this(spoke) for my son, I did this for my daughter." A sense of doer-ship arises in everyone, that I am the doer, I am the one who does it. But when He said, 'You do the action and leave it at My feet,' it meant that you should not feel you are doing something, and this can only happen when you become a tool in the hands of God, become His instrument. Unless this happens, you cannot become akarmi(feeling you are not the doer). So He said, let people try; When they will be tired, they will take to Sahaja Yoga. The third thing he said, that too very beautifully, is that, "You give Me flowers, fruits, water." Whatever you offer Me, whether it's flowers, fruit, or water, I'll accept it. But while giving, He has said in a very (diplomatic) manner, that while giving, your devotion should be matchless. Now the whole play is based on the word 'Ananya', that too is Krishna's playfulness. Ananya means when there is not the other.

That can only happen when you are united with the Supreme Being, when you are one with Him. And it is also written everywhere that the Power of God, the Power of His love, moves throughout the world and through It many tasks are accomplished – it is written like this. It is also written that we can have a connection with that Power. But if we doubt them, and think that they're all lying, then My opinion is that we have closed our brains. Whatever is written in these scriptures is absolutely true. But because our subtle vision is not yet open, that's why we misunderstand it. That is why Kabir says, "How can I explain, the whole world is blind?" Even those who seek the Truth are deeply steeped in falsehood. And that's why today people are standing up against religion, saying that religion is a very bad thing and that religion causes harm. All the religions that humans have created are based on the level of intellect, not on the level of truth.

One of its identification is that, whether one's a Hindu, Muslim, Christian, or whatever, they have no thought for whatever sin they are committing. A person of any caste can commit sin, why is that so? If he is in a caste and says that, "I am so and so, I belong to this religion, I belong to that religion," then, everyone commits sins. This means that this truth has not been awakened within them. When this truth awakens within a person that, "I am a religious man," and what is called righteousness in English If that thing has happened within me, then he can never do anything wrong. So this must be understood that this religion which has been described must manifest within us. Its effect must come from there. That is why religion is in such a predicament today. You are seeing that in every religion there is nothing except fighting amongst themselves. Religious people are not seen doing any auspicious work these days.

And whatever good deeds they do, they do so in order to somehow divide religion and then fights start again. Either you will fight amongst yourselves or you are making the fights of two religions into ten religions. When fighting is the work of religion, then it's better there is no religion. So when the children of today will see that we are just fighting like this in the name of religion, and out of blind faith we are now running towards it, then they will definitely think that this is a wrong thing. Moreover, many superstitious people are completely clutching all religions. And because of that entrapment, the form of religion that we see today appears distorted. Therefore, man moves away from God and wonders if this is religion. Should this be called religion, in which all kinds of vices, wickedness, and money are, and all sorts of things are going on like this. This can't be religion. But we should think — one thing is very simple and straightforward - if we have a scriptural(shastriye) approach, then we must open our minds and we should think that these great people who have been and what they have said, if we reflect about it a little, how would it be?

Now, regarding the knowledge of Kundalini, I say that it is not just Mine. This has been going on in our country since times immemorial which through devotion and the Vedas, was done and continued to be done by the Nath sect, in a very secretive manner. As you might have heard that Nachiketa went to King Janaka and requested him to give him self-realization. Our human condition at that time was such that very few flowers had blossomed. And only one or two flowers were going to be formed into fruits. That's why only one or two people got self-realization. And it is said in all the religions that a time will come when many people will attain this thing. Muhammad Sahib has said that, "When the time of resurrection comes" - He used to call it Kiama - "at that time your hands will speak" "and these hands will give evidence against you" – this is written in many ways in the Koran. Many things we don't understand because, because how can hands speak and how can they bear witness against you? Now, this power of Kundalini, about which I am going to tell you, it's placed within you, it's fully established in the triangular bone.

And this is called Aasaas in the language of Mohammad Sahab, this is what is called the Holy Ghost in the language of Christ, and this is called Kundalini in Sanskrit language. And that's how it's described in Zen, and in every religion. Now, this Kundalini is called the Holy Ghost, meaning it is a power, this is the Desire Power of God Almighty which is reflected within us. And it is the Spirit which is the reflection of God within us. Now, whatever I am saying, please consider it as a concept. I have put forward a concept before you. Just like there is a hypothesis in Science, I am presenting a hypothesis to you. Now, if you understand this concept and can experience it, and if you're honest, you'll surely say it's true, and then it becomes a law/way of action. Now this Kundalini is seated within us in the triangular bone, and this is ours, of each one of us, personal, individual, separate Kundalini. and in it your past lives, this life, everything is written.

And She knows where you've strayed, where you've stalled, what mistakes you've made. And when this Kundalini awakens, It pierces the six chakras, six the seventh chakra is beneath it, and the seventh chakra controls it. That, I should say, if we call the lowest chakra the first chakra, then the limbic area which is in our head the limbic area which is in our brain, is called Sahastrara, and it also opens this seventh chakra. So if the first chakra is below then it penetrates the seventh chakra, which is the limbic area in our head. Now you will say, "Mother, why are You talking about these old things in modern times?" Because the modern times today, which we think to be a big deal, you'll be surprised that when we see abroad, we realize that all together they are going into a very big, ditch. Some of you must have been there, but I've been living there for years. Now you look at the situation there – everyone has a household too. There's no concept of home and family among the people there. Even that is nothing.

Most of the people there have started taking drugs. Even children there have started taking drugs. Then there are many dirty diseases there. In those countries where the Holy Incarnation of Jesus Christ has such an influence, seeing this there, the whole world seemed like Anti-Christ How can they be said that they follow Jesus Christ? Who even said in (UNCLEAR) that, 'Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.' Jesus Christ who says such a thing, 'There should be purity even in the eyes,' why are these people doing like this? Similarly, we see that among Hindus, when it is said that everyone has a Spirit within them, So if everyone has a Spirit, how are you creating castes etc.? And earlier, castes etc were also based on the tasks done. And it is clearly stated in many [UNCLEAR - this?] that the one who knows the Brahma is a Brahmin.

So nowadays, we can even keep a Brahmin at our place to cook food. So, can he be a Brahmin? A Brahmin is one who has known the Brahma. Similarly, in blind faith, man has left caste, caste which is, it has been made in such a way that instead of keeping it on the basis of work, it has been made on the basis of caste. The reason why this has been done is because the way you see it in the West that people have suffered so much loss and have had such a downfall, similarly, we see that even in the Eastern countries there is great detriment and we too are going towards a downfall. Even here we have many kinds of wickedness, like the work of ghosts, sorcery etc. and many kinds of superstitions, then the coming of gurus, and many gurus have gone abroad. They have robbed many people, taking money, all these pursuits are going on. But one must know the Truth first, then only can one recognize the falsehood. Unless you know the Truth, you cannot recognize the untruth.

So in order to know the Truth, God has made a very beautiful arrangement within us. This is God. His arrangement is very well-organized and systematic. It is that, this Kundalini which is sitting below in the triangular bone, simply by awakening It, It pierces the Brahmarandhra, then your connection becomes one with the All Pervading Power spread throughout. Now you have a very strong proof of this as well, a proof, whether there is this Power in the Universe or not. Now you see that the height of a human being reaches a certain limit. The height of a coconut tree goes up to a limit. If there's some other tree, its height reaches a certain limit. In this way if you look at the finer works, so if there's a child, then the mother of that child, there will be a great similarity between that child and the mother. The child of an Indian will be like an Indian.

Thousands of such acts happen in this world. Or you think like this also, that there's a seed, a mango tree will grow from that seed. Many trees will grow from them, but they will all be mango trees. Where does all this power come from, where does all this arrangement come from, where does it all get organized? All this arrangement is made by the Power of God's love that is spread throughout all the Universe. Till today we have only used the power of hatred. Even when we practice religion(dharma), and even when we take the name of God, we still use the power of hatred. We have never used the power of love till date. So this Power of Love, which is spread everywhere and has been working since eternity, being connected with it is Yoga. The rest, standing on your head and doing all sorts of exercises, and Dravidi Pranayama, these things that are, are not yoga.

In reality Yoga is our connection with the Almighty, or the All Pervading Power that pervades this universe. Being connected is only, you can say to be yoga. All of you are entitled to this yoga. Now Sahaja means, 'saha' means 'with you', 'ja' means 'born', this is Kundalini. And yoga means, what I told you that, to be connected with the Power that pervades this universe. This is your birthright because you are in the form of a human being. Man is superior to all the things created in the world. What is called the epitome of evolution, and now it just needs to achieve one last thing, where the Kundalini awakens and pierces to pass through the six chakras, so they become united with God. What happens as a result of that? People will ask this that, what is the benefit of this?

Firstly, you should know that you cannot give any money in this. This is a living work, God is living, and His power is living. This living act, the way you put the seed into the mother's womb, of Mother Earth, so it flourishes on its own, similarly this Power also flourishes on its own. If you try to force it, it's not going to happen. It's not about money in this, that you give some money to the Earth, or you pay some money to that seed – nothing. This is a living work, which we call Sahaja, meaning spontaneous. And this process sparks by itself and with its help the Kundalini gets awakened. And then you get this experience, in which you can feel that cool breeze is blowing all around. This has also been described and said by Adi Shankaracharya as 'Saleelam Saleelam'. And is spoken of as the 'Cool breeze of the Holy Ghost' in the Bible.

Everywhere it has been described, you first be able to feel (UNCLEAR). And cool air should also come from the Brahmarandhra on your head. Then you come to know that your Brahmarandhra has been pierced. Now, after that, you'll be surprised that how so many things happen. That first of all you will be overwhelmed with joy. But it becomes something special in you, something special happens, by which you get satisfaction. Your illness gets cured. Many incurable diseases, Cancer, blood cancer, and mellitus, and various other diseases of the world have been cured by it. Now this is not a matter of mesmerism. Delhi University has seen and understood this and they have introduced it in their Medical College, so, three doctors have received their M.D.

in this. One, they have got in physical fitness, and one has got on Psychosomatic diseases, and one on your epilepsy. They have received their M.D. in these three subjects. Means it has been proven that these diseases are cured through Sahaja Yoga. And similarly today in London, seven doctors are writing on this, that what all happens through Sahaja Yoga. Now you can't pay for it, you can't demand anything for it, There is no guarantee for anyone. Your Kundalini if awakened, then this is also your good deed from your previous life, and you [UNCLEAR – didn't understand?]. But if someone says, "Mother, just do it for me," then I can't do this. When it happens to you, it will happen spontaneously, and if it doesn't happen, it won't happen.

Now, those people who are ill with some disease, or those who are very intellectual, live by their intelligence and either those people who are always crying and sad it takes time for such people's Kundalini to be awakened. But it hasn't happened yet that someone came to Me and theirs didn't awaken, or they didn't receive it from Me. After awakening, this connection, this yoga of yours that has been achieved, has to be made permanent, it has to be established. Until this thing settles down, till then again and again this Kundalini will keep falling down and it goes to such a place where you have a problem. Because of this, sometimes it can also happen that you become sick again. There's no harm in telling you that when our Mr. .0Sanjeeva Reddy came from America, so it was a coincidence that I had gone to the airport in London. So his Mrs. told him that this is Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi – he knew me as Mrs. Srivastava. So he said, "Okay," his wife said that, "Do something to somewhat cure my husband," "Because he's in a lot of agony, he can't sleep, he has taken so many pills, he is very restless." He had come after the operation. He must have been something special, that he was better in ten minutes, in ten minutes.

And he was telling Me, "When I landed (UNCLEAR - Roman?) at the airport, then everyone started wondering" "whether my ghost had come down? Everything was arranged there for my cremation." But he didn't do Sahaja Yoga after that. If he had practiced Sahaja Yoga, his condition would have been alright. There are many such people, whose names I could tell you, who are very high class people, they have a big name, like your Dada, Vasant Dada Patil. Sahaja Yogis also cured him. Sahaja Yogis cured him, after that he became quite well, then started moving about, afterwards not in Sahaja Yoga. So it has to be stabilized. And if you don't stabilize it, it is possible you become again a human and might be troubled by this again.

And we should also think that The God Almighty, He too has a little common sense, which is said to be, should have common sense that, why work hard for someone who won't give light? We know that a lamp that doesn't give light, we never fix it, it's useless. Similarly, I see that even God's attention turns away from such people, those who do not want to go deep into it and do not want to spread Sahaja Yoga. Because in Sahaja Yoga there is no money involved, only blessings and blessings. You don't have to leave your home, you don't have to renounce anything, on the contrary, if an ascetic comes, we have to tell him, to change his clothes and come here, this renunciation is not going to work. This is to be found only in the household, as told in the Nala-Damayanti narrative. That people living in households will get all these things only in Kaliyuga. And this thing is only available to those who live in households, but it has many, many, many benefits. First of all, as I said, your health improves. Your health improves.

You start to look younger. A lot of power is infused within you. You can do a lot of things and you don't get tired. And your intellect becomes sharp. Many children who were told in school, "These children are of quite low intelligence and they can't cope." Such children are coming first nowadays. After coming to our Sahaja Yoga such children who had no hope of passing even are now coming first. Their intellect become sharp. Then there are artists who are musicians, or anyone supposing those who are artists, a new art emerges from them. People have had many experiences of this.

If you people talk to some artists, then they will tell you. Like there are Amjad Ali and Bismillah Khan Sahib, etc., they all will tell you that when they, what would happen to them when they started playing in front of Me? What happened when they came into Sahaja Yoga? In this way, many people are there in whom there is a difference. But the thing is that a difference comes in them and they move forward too but unless you hold on to anything deeply, until then, neither are you of any use to God nor to yourself. This greatly increases a person's lifespan and man becomes more religious by temperament. Religious in reality, not false, not pretentious religiosity, real religiosity, which is called righteousness, that a person does not do anything wrong that maybe harmful and he doesn't covet, and he also (UNCLEAR) gets used to. By the awakening of the Lakshmi principle, financial problems get solved. So many people's financial problems were solved. My brother who is in India, "Ever since I've been realized, my condition is such," "that I don't understand I'm getting all the money of the world, what can I say?"

So those questions of yours are also resolved. But you won't rise more than necessary because I told you earlier that these are perishable things, and all perishable things are fine up to a point. When you cross that boundary, those very things make you destructive. Therefore, till the limit you have to grow you receive everything up to that limit. And you are in satisfaction. After this, the [UNCLEAR - guru?] element is very, very loving. There is so much love, so much forgiveness, that such a person forgives every single mistake. And after forgiving, he gains insight as to with which person he should pick a fight and with which he should not. Like I'll tell you about Jesus Christ that when people were pelting Mary Magdalene with stones, He went and stood before them.

Now, Jesus Christ had no connection with the business what was hers, He was a detached person, but He stood up. He said, "Whosoever among you has not sinned, let him throw a stone at Me." This courage, this courage also, because He was Himself the Spirit. Unless you become the Spirit, you do not have the capability within you. Means, being equal to the meaning. You don't only get to your own meaning, and sometimes you went into that, sometimes went to [UNCLEAR - Truth? ], sometimes folded hands in front of this, sometimes folded hands in front of that. So, instead of folding hands before everyone, you have to fold hands before God only. And you become perfect and achieve everything. In the present day, when man is so disturbed and he's been troubled so much from all sides, at that time, when the power of the Spirit comes from within, then a new form shines.

Now take the example of My brother, that he is a chartered accountant and he didn't even know Marathi language [UNCLEAR]. All my brothers were very bad at it. And were very weak in languages, but I used to write their essays. This was their condition, all from the elder brother onwards, everyone. But then in Marathi language, he didn't know anything in language. But today I see that he writes such poems – have you heard his poetry? And he's a chartered accountant, who just kept counting one, two, three, four - he started writing poems. Not only that, but even in Urdu language, because Urdu he [UNCLEAR] he knew a little bit. But he did not know Urdu language - he started writing poems in Urdu. And he's so famous.

Just went to where [UNCLEAR - Saurashtra?] the government had released and displayed everything on him. But we are living in Nagpur, doesn't mean we are living in a well. We are connected to the whole society, we are related to the whole world. When I first came to Nagpur, then I noticed that - a sadhu in the household is called a Sadhukada - similar was My condition. Initially, no one really listened to Me, so I said, "Okay, when the Nagpur people come to this state, I'll go and talk to them." That's why I have now come to Nagpur after being to(visiting) Gujarat. But I know that I have lived here, and there are lots of vibrations here, it is special. And if the people of Nagpur will take to Sahaja Yoga, the whole world will come and bow at your feet. You just heard that Sahaja Yoga is in twenty-six countries; in fact, Sahaja Yoga is being practiced in thirty countries.

And representatives from there come here once a year. If you look at them, you'll be surprised to see them singing things like Jogwa and Podwa in Marathi. They compose beautiful hymns in Hindi language and sing them rhythmically. And these people are singing like male and female. These people have done so much that a Sahaja Yogi has come so he is doing Rajasthani painting. I said that, "How did you learn Rajasthani painting?" If a Marathi person wants to do Rajasthani painting, then he cannot do it. Started saying, "Mother, when the light of the Spirit comes, then hand automatically understands the essence of the color." And the thing is that when we come down to our principle, the essence of everything comes into us. Now, those with whom we are related, who are our people, through Sahaja Yoga, when you have a conversation, if you talk in Sahaja Yoga, then they pay attention to the real thing in you.

Before that there is fake relationship. Now you know that I think that the most learned and if ever there was someone who rose to such a high level of spirituality, it was in our own Maharashtra, you know that he has written the Pasaydaan, Gynaneshwari. And the Pasaydan written by Gynaneshwarji, that is complete Sahaja Yoga, a description of complete Sahaja Yoga. Similarly, what Rabindranath Tagore has also written that, "Come to the shores of India," all this, every single word of it is absolutely correct about the program that we have at Ganpatipule. Not only that, a hundred year ago there was a great poet, William Blake, in London. He related so many minute details where Sahaja Yoga would begin, and where My home would be, and where I would stay — he gave every detail. There was one Lewis, he has described the entire procession in such detail you will be surprised how he wrote so meticulously. Because these people were seers, and seers have seen and described this thing. Not only this, thousands of years ago, you know there had been this Bhrigu Muni, who has made all our horoscopes etc, and he was the complete helmsman of the horoscope. He started all this thing.

What all he has written about future and astrology, etc. nothing was written prior to that. He was such a scholar of this, he has also written a treatise, which is called Naadi Granth. And in that Na adi Granth, he has described the whole Sahaja Yoga in such detail, And it is even said that when this yoga will begin, when the Kundalini will awaken spontaneously, then there'll be no need for hospitals. And I think genuinely that if people practice Sahaja Yoga, there is no need for hospitals. This thing happens so spontaneously and simply and if a doctor looks at Sahaja Yoga with an open mind, he will be amazed. And thus you think that there are seven English doctors who are astonished - a very big doctor has also come here, who has earned a great reputation at Cambridge and Oxford. And today he's the Head of the Department of Psychiatrist (UNCLEAR - BALWAN?). And I see, all the people who come to Sahaja Yoga, of great intelligence, which is called in Marathi, tallakh(brilliant), means intellect, a very pure intellect. One whose intellect has some conditioning and he has twisted, collected, created something, that is not in Sahaja Yoga.

Because we have not yet known the truth, and we have to know it, we have to attain it in this very life. Unless we have this concept/notion, Sahaja Yoga is not going to happen, won't happen till then. Thus, I want to tell the people of Nagpur that now you feel like I have come for the first time, but My entire childhood has been spent here. I even went to school here only. And even I walked barefoot all around. My father always said that the Girl who is coming barefoot with slippers in Her hand is the (UNCLEAR). So that everyone here may receive vibrations and this region becomes more fragrant, with this thought, I've made a lot of efforts since childhood. It must definitely show results. I am your own, I am from Nagpur only, but that does not mean, that if someone's your own, then you don't take the advantage from that person which you should. Because for this you have nothing to give, there is no such system, we don't have any organization.

You might be surprised that we had to form a trust but we don't have anything, anyone's name written anywhere. There's no membership, nothing, everything is being formed. And when it was started, then even My husband used to say, that You are a saint, but You cannot make anyone a saint. This transformation cannot happen. I believe you are a saint, but no one else can be/become a saint. Then, in the beginning, there was some opposition from him as well, that, "Why leave the household and work?" And now he himself has helped Me so much, with so much money, has helped Me with everything that somehow I do Sahaja Yoga. (UNCLEAR) also recently there was a lecture before the Sahaja Yogis, so he said, "This is the real United Nations." Even when Bismillah Khan had a program, so he started saying to Me that "Mother, have You created all these pure and spotless people?" So I said, 'I am creating Khalistan for them.'

Then he said, "What are they making?" I said, "Go ask them what they're making." 'Khaalis' means that you become pure. And this Vishwa Nirmal Dharma only has now been registered in America. The thing about Vishwa Nirmal Dharma is that you have to become. You just can't be a fanatic only. Someone tells you on your head that you have become a Christian from tomorrow. Someone gives you a sacred thread and says, "You have become a Brahmin." Not such falsity. In this you have to become, this thing has to happen within you.

It has to shine through in your personality. Only then do you achieve the Vishwa Nirmal Dharma, otherwise you do not. So from the human state we rise to a higher state. This is the ultimate goal of our evolution. Supposing there's an animal, any horse or bull or anything, You can take him through a dirty drain, he'll go. He won't have any problems. Man cannot go, because in evolution he has known all these things, filth and beauty. When a person attains this state, the impurities of his past come to an end. He understands the filth of evil, the filth of causing pain to others. And where he has the responsibility to correct someone, then he stands up to that too.

That's also the thing. You achieve this kind of special, miraculous personality. Many people who could never even give a speech, when they speak in Sahaja Yoga, then I am left speechless after listening to them that how well they have started speaking how in such a special way they have come before everyone. I have to tell you this, that this power is your own. As they say in Marathi, 'Tujha aai tujha paaije' It is your own. And awakening this Power is also very easy and simple. Now there are many books which say that this Power causes perturbation. Sir, I have to thousands of people... In Bombay, about fifteen thousand people come here. This time also twelve to fifteen thousand people came there in Vashi, but no one had any problem.

On the other hand, they all said, "Mother, we felt so nice, and now we're in bliss." "And now all our desires, all our ailments are healed," all this only. But you must have this Pure Desire within that we attain the Truth. Because this Kundalini that is, is the Pure Desire. But if you already have wrong conditionings, that, "No, I think this is right, I think this is correct." Now you know The Truth only. You know the truth with your intellect – you don't know The Truth (only). Suppose there is a man, he's a very bad man. So how will you know whether this person is bad or not? You have no such way.

But if you are a Sahaja Yogi, so you just have to put your hands like this and ask, 'Is this man good or bad?' If he's bad, you'll feel the heat; sometimes blisters may even appear for a while. And if he's good, then a cool breeze will come from within you. Once it so happened that some people in Poona said, "No, we will not allow Mataji." because it's like this, like that, about a variety of things. So I, no one told Me, but when I reached there, they started saying, "She speaks against religion," and said things like this. So I said, "Those among you who are religious should come and sit in front." So they came and sat in front. I said, "Okay alright, you put your hands towards Me." So their hands started (shaking) like this.

I said, "What's going on?" They said, "Yes, You fix this (UNCLEAR) why are nervous?" "Fix this, because it's like this, we agree You're the power, otherwise our hands wouldn't shake like this." So I said, "No one else's are shaking, why are only yours shaking?" So some other people were sitting there. They started saying, "Why are their hands shaking?" I said, "Ask them who they are." They said, "We're certified lunatics from Thana." "And one lunatic was cured, so we've come here to be cured." So these who were posing to be religious and those crazy people, all of them were of the same type, they were shaking like this.

Then they understood that the imagination in them is craziness. And we are not being righteous in this; we have become fanatics because we do not have dharma within us. Until Dharma awakens within us, purity doesn't come in us, we are not pure. And it is necessary to be pure because by being pure, the entire power of God is (UNCLEAR) with us. Many people say that when there is a lot of virtue, we cannot move about(exist) in this world. We can't do without lying - there's no need. The Truth will bow before you. The whole thing will unfold in such a way that you will be astonished. Now look, I am a woman, and I am a householder. I've done so much work in eighteen years, I've worked in so many countries.

It is all the Divine Power. Such is the Divine power that it makes things happen in such a way that you'll be surprised, "Oh, I didn't think such a thing happened." "Who went, who did this?" But how can this be explained to such people who think that there is no God? That haven't found out whether God exists or not. How can you say that God doesn't exist? Because you want to drink alcohol, you want to do dirty things, want to murder everyone, want to harass everyone, so said that there is no God. Otherwise, saying that there is God would create some restrictions. So, we must first find out whether there is God or not, and through Kundalini it's path is very easy, simple, that should be achieved. I'll tell you tomorrow about these chakras which have been shown.

But today I have explained Sahaja Yoga to you as a proposal(hypothesis). Although during (UNCLEAR) days thousands of speeches have been given in three or four languages. And later when you come to Sahaja Yoga, then when you will get well, then you too may get to hear those speeches. Especially, I say that books even on Sahaja Yoga should not be given. Because people's minds get corrupted as soon as they take a book. Because you know that reading so much spoils a person's mind. That's why Kabir said, "By reading a lot, even the scholars become fools." All the people outside have entered in; people think they have become Sahaja Yogis by reading a book. Not by reading books, it's with becoming. You have to become.

Suppose that it's said about this thing that it's very good, it's a good means. That there's no need even for a loudspeaker, it's very good. And what's the point if it doesn't have a connection? What's the benefit of using it? Anything you [UNCLEAR] want to do, let the connection happen first. And same is the case with Me, and this time has come. I call it blossom time. Spring has come. Thousands of flowers are such which are searching for God. But it must be come from a true heart and should be taken into consideration, should come into the mind(brain), that we haven't found the Truth yet, and if the time has come to get it, then why not take it?

And if it's available for free, then why not get(receive) it? If tomorrow I say that there's a diamond here for free and you all come, So people will come from Australia. But the diamond that is within you, if you have to achieve it, then you don't think that something should be done about it? Thus I request all of you, that if you wish, then after this we will do a program for the awakening of the Kundalini which will take only ten minutes. So, all of you please understand that which is your left hand put towards Me. It's good to take off your slippers because the Mother Earth takes away a lot of our troubles. Take off your shoes and also your caps, because it's about piercing the Brahmarandhra. And Mother is not some minister etc, to put on a cap – She's your Mother. What's it to a Mother? You are completely acceptable, just the way you are.

Now, put left hand towards Me. The left side, meaning it is, the Power of Desire, it's your desire that you attain self-realization. And keep the right hand on your heart. Now see, I've told about the chakras, but don't dwell on them, that if we have a heart problem it will be cured. Not to think of such things, don't think of anything at this time now. I am telling to do this because when Kundalini will be awakened then many things will be fine on their own. Now here is the place of the Spirit; The reflection of God Almighty, in the Spirit form, is in our hearts. After that place this hand on the upper part of the stomach – this is the Guru principle within us. In this we achieve the principle of a guru – what is called proficiency, expertise. As an example of this, consider that if there's a car in which you have an accelerator and a brake so, at first, when you don't learn, you can't drive, but when you start learning, then sometimes you press the accelerator, sometimes you press the brake.

Like this also, we have two powers, the brake one is the left, and the accelerator one is the right. Sometimes use this, sometimes use that; you learn by doing again and again. Then you become the driver, but right now the master is sitting at the back. Its master is sitting behind. After that, you become the master. Then you see that there is a driver within you, then we see and you also see its brake, and also see its accelerator. But you are a master – that is what is called a Sadguru but he is the master. Its proficiency is achieved very easily. You don't need renunciation, don't need fasting in this, don't need anything. It's just this that you have to give a little time, ten minutes a day.

We should give some time to ourselves also because mostly we give time to others only. If you give yourself just ten minutes, then to you will progress a lot. And every week there is a collective program here, go there and meditate there. That's it, nothing more is needed. Now, on this side, there is the Guru principle, and it is therefore possible for you to achieve this Guru principle because all the Sadgurus have worked hard to create your Guru Tatva. So it should be said that it is the left nabhi only. After that place your hand on the lower side of the abdomen, on the left hand side. This is the chakra of pure knowledge. Impure knowledge is that which comes from fanaticism, which comes through wrong means, and when we wander here and there in search of God. This is impure knowledge.

And pure knowledge is such that it is felt in every nerve of our body. We feel it in our every nerve. It is felt in our Central Nervous System, which is called as 'Vid'(to know), which is called realization, which is known(realized). For this knowledge to happen within us, we have to awaken this chakra. Now take this hand up again. This ours, then we are raising the Kundalini to the Guru principle. After that we place it on our hearts and later we place it between our shoulder and neck and turn the head to the right. After that, place your hand in this way and place it on this chakra, meaning where have to forgive everyone. Now you have to place this same hand on the back side, here, behind the optic lobe, here. And you have to put it on it like this and tilt(rest) your head.

Why this - it is a kind of method of yoga? But after this you will attain what is called spiritual union(yoga). Now, after this, you have to stretch this hand. After stretching this hand, you, the center part of it – you are seeing here, this is Sahastrara, meaning, this is the limbic area, the Sahastrara. The space in the middle of it, it exactly the center of this place - our palate, which is sort of hard, this and that, and bending your fingers back and rotate your hand seven times. That's all you have to do. Now after this, close your eyes. In mesmerism, it is said to keep your eyes open, but in this, you must close your eyes completely. And take off your glasses, too. Because, please don't open your eyes.

Until the Kundalini is not fully awakened, do not open your eyes unless I tell you to. Because – bring hand down – because your attention should remain inside. Opening your eyes outside causes the attention to wander outside. So you please do this. And those who don't want to do this act, they may please go outside and don't disturb others. I request just this that you all go outside. Those who don't want to do this should not sit here. Many of those people who were shamelessly sitting here, laughing and troubling everyone, It's a wrong thing, when you all have come here, get it. Why disturb others? Whoever wants to take it, let him take it.

The truth (UNCLEAR), then why are you disturbing him? And sat there laughing out loud at him. This is not the way. It's like this that someone who doesn't know classical music just laughs in the classical, because is not able to understand, so just laugh it off. And there is nothing to show off in between. Have to attain it, have to get it's experience. If you don't get it's experience, then only you will [fall short of] it. What am I going to lose? I don't need any Sahaja Yoga. Now put your left hand towards Me and your right hand on your heart.

Now there is a reflection of the Spirit in our heart. So now you close your eyes. Everyone close your eyes. Not too hard and not too lightly. Don't even open it halfway. Just as you open your eyes completely, close them the same way. After that you, keeping the hand on the heart, ask Me a question that is absolutely a fundamental question that, "Shri Mataji," ask a question as you would to a computer. "Shri Mataji, am I the Spirit?" Ask this three times. Close your eyes completely.

Do not lift your eyes upwards; keep them straight. There should be no movement of the eye. Yes. "Shri Mataji, am I the Spirit?" Don't open the eyes, please don't open the eyes. Now, after asking this question three times, should know, that if you are the Spirit, then your Spirit is your guru. So, place your right hand on the upper part of the stomach on the left hand side. And after keeping it, you ask, that, "Shri Mataji, am I my own guru?" Meaning I am the Spirit, means I am my own guru. "Shri Mataji, am I my own guru?"

Ask three times. After that, place your right hand on the lower part of your stomach. This is the place of Pure Knowledge, the left side of Swadhisthana. Here you are free. I cannot force anything on you, I cannot impose Pure Knowledge on you. Thus you ask, say, "Shri Mataji, You please give me Pure Knowledge." If you won't say, I can't force it on you. In your freedom you have to ask, "Shri Mataji, You please give me Pure Knowledge." After this, you have to say this six times, because this chakra has six petals. After this, you will have to place your right hand on the upper part of the stomach on the left hand side.

Now when you have asked for Pure Knowledge, the Kundalini has begun to stir(move). And the Kundalini is rising after being awakened, but in order to help the chakras which are above, you place your hand on the Guru Tattva and say one thing ten times with complete confidence that, "Shri Mataji, I am my own Guru, Shri Mataji, I am my own Guru." Now say it ten times because we have ten guru principles within. So please say it ten times. Now raise this right hand and place it on your heart again. And here – keep your feet slightly apart, but don't open your eyes. This place, you say again with complete confidence, with complete confidence, "Shri Mataji, I am the Spirit." This is the greatest Truth. "Shri Mataji, I am the Spirit." Greatest Truth.

You say this twelve times, twelve times. Now raise your right hand and place it between your neck and head - from the front, take it from the front not from the back, from the front. and turn your neck to the right. Now here you should know that God Almighty, Who is in the form of Supreme Consciousness (Paramchaitanya), He is the ocean of Grace and Mercy, but the most of all,He is the ocean of forgiveness. That's why any mistake you make, He can forgive it completely. So you, with a happy mind, say it sixteen times here that, "Shri Mataji, I am not guilty at all." Say it sixteen times, sixteen times, sixteen times "I'm not guilty at all, I didn't do anything wrong." Now gather this right hand and keep it on your forehead, keep on the forehead, on the forehead. And press it from both sides. Press from both sides.

Just like when you have a headache, you press it, press it from both sides. Now here you say, "Shri Mataji, I have forgiven everyone all together." "Forgiven everyone all together." Many people say that it's very difficult to forgive. See, this is a wrong thing. To forgive is difficult, and not to forgive is difficult - Both of these things are of the mind because you don't do anything, whether you forgive or don't. So should know that when we don't forgive then because of ourselves we're playing into the hands of the wrong people. So for everyone say it together, don't remember anyone, don't mention anyone by name, all together. Now the same hand, say it with your heart, it doesn't matter how many times, say it with your heart - and now take this hand to the back portion of your head, and lift your head upwards, and hold(rest) it on your hand. Here you have to say, for your own solution, and not feeling that you are guilty, but peacefully, understanding the peace within, that "If we, O Supreme Consciousness!

O Spirit! If we have committed any mistake, then You please forgive us." You can say it only once, but say it with all your heart. Now open your right hand completely and the place that is in its center, place that on your fontanel bone area and bend your head, and press it firmly. Because here, open the big hole and rotate it clockwise very slowly, seven times. Even at this time, I respect your freedom and I must tell you that, "Shri Mataji, please give me Self-Realization." This cannot be forced upon you. You say it with humility seven times, with your head bowed. Say it with bent head. Bend your head, bend your neck forward and with bent neck say that, "Shri Mataji, please give me Self-Realization."

Right now I'm blowing on Pranava, and that's necessary, and you'll see the results. How beneficial it is. There's no magic in it, it's Pranav. [Shri Mataji blows Pranava into the microphone] [Shri Mataji blows Pranava into the microphone] [Shri Mataji blows Pranava into the microphone] [Shri Mataji blows Pranava into the microphone] [Shri Mataji blows Pranava into the microphone] [Shri Mataji blows Pranava into the microphone] [Shri Mataji blows Pranava into the microphone] [Shri Mataji blows Pranava into the microphone] [Shri Mataji blows Pranava into the microphone] Now you take both the hands down and slowly open your eyes. Keep both hands towards Me. Slowly open your eyes, slowly, very slowly. Keep both your hands towards Me. Open your eyes very slowly. Now, keep your right hand towards Me. Now you are thoughtless; no thoughts are coming to you.

And you see with your head bent - place your right hand towards Me - whether any cool breeze is coming out of your fontanel bone area? Now place your left hand towards Me; Bend your head, open your eyes and see whether there is some cool air coming from your fontanel bone area. See on the right hand, keep the left hand towards Me. Now place your right hand towards Me for the last time and see(check) with your left hand, whether there is any cool breeze coming from the fontanel bone area. Now, with both your hands towards the sky, with head tilted back, ask Me a question that, "Shri Mataji, is this the Param Chaitanya?" or "Shri Mataji, is this the love of God?" or "Shri Mataji, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Spirit?" You ask any question three times, with the neck turned upwards. Now bring the hands down. Those who felt the cool breeze on their heads and those who have felt it on their hands or in their hands, please raise both your hands.

Some people - okay, now put down - must have felt in one hand. Those who felt coolness in just one hand, please raise your hands. who has in only one hand - so it doesn't matter. If you have got in your right hand, then keep your left hand towards Me and your right hand on the ground. And if you have got in your left hand, then place your right hand towards Me and left hand on the ground — no, up like this. Most people may not have got it in their right hand because we're very right-sided, we work a lot, that's why. Now, on this you forgive. Keeping hand like this, forgive everyone, everyone. Right Hand - mostly people don't get it on the right hand. The thing is, we're very right-sided, do a lot of work, think, think about the future, plan.

Right hand? Right hand? It's alright, forgive. At this moment we should say, "We forgive everyone." Just say this, "We have forgiven everyone." Is it coming in your hand now? In the right hand? Keep hand like this. Didn't come? Did it come in the left?

No, talking about those who didn't get in the right. Who is not getting in the right? Are you people getting in the right? Are you getting? See, you didn't forgive. Had you forgiven, it would have come before. Just have to forgive. It'll definitely come. Is it coming? No, keep your right hand towards Me.

Not coming in the left hand? Okay, then lower your right hand. Yes, this earth element sucks. And when you do your right hand, then the sky element(ether) sucks. Is it alright? Okay, alright. Do keeping the left hand like this and right hand like this. Many times it also happens due to liver disease; so place your left hand on your liver. Place your right hand on the liver, left hand. Now you have become a saint.

Now let's see how many people felt cool in their hands? Raise your hands again once? All the people who got it in their hands or heads? Yes do it, again, all the people who got it. If everyone raises up, then will be able to see clearly. Many people have experienced, many people. Now the only thing to learn in this is that, as there is a seed, its sprout has come out but it must become a tree. Therefore, it is important that this is a collective work and you people please come to our center and receive this. It is very important that all of you come to the collective and get it.
