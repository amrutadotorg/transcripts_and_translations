Jai Shri Mataji. It's a pleasure to have Janet Fisher for a Zoom interview, an audio to share her memories with Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi. Janet got her realization in 1982. Could we please request you to tell us where you were and what you were doing when you got your realization, Janet? And thank you very much for joining us, of course.

Okay, my pleasure. So in 1982, I was living in London. I'd been living in London for a good few years, but I was from Birmingham. My home was in Birmingham, but I'd lived in London for years. And I was in a very bad state in 1982. My mother had died a few months before, and I was very close to my mother. And also, I had come to the end of a love affair. So I was in a bad state, and the doctor had given me tranquilizers. They weren't working. I was still in a bad state. I went back to the doctor, and he gave me a heavier tranquilizer. I took one. I had these tranquilizers and was like a zombie. And that night, I prayed to God, "There must be another way."

The very next day, I didn't feel like cooking, so I went for a pizza. I stopped on the train at one stop, and the only available seat in the restaurant was next to a young man. I asked if I could sit next to him, and it was John Pearson. Anyway, I ordered my pizza, and I was reading a book on how to deal with depression. John leaned over and said, "Excuse me, are you reading that book out of academic interest?" I just remember his words. And he just started telling me about Shri Mataji and Sahaja Yoga.

That very night—I was so blessed—Shri Mataji was talking in person in Hampstead. And I went along with John. He told me all about it. I just went along. We were late, so we sat at the back. I didn't get my realization that night. And Shri Mataji, as she was leaving, she stopped at me. And she said, "Her mother is laying on her heart. Tell your mother you're all right." I mean, this is what she said. Just as she was leaving.

On Monday, she was talking at Caxton Hall. This was on the Thursday at Hampstead. And that weekend, a lot of things happened. Sahaja Yogis know. I just knew I had to go back to see her. On the Monday, I sat in the front row. Shri Mataji was talking, and she talked about Christ. Well, I'm Jewish; I'm from a Jewish background. And I said, "But Mother"—we called her Mother then, we didn't call her Shri Mataji—I said, "Mother, I've been taught not to believe in Jesus Christ." And she just said, "You've been taught wrong, my dear."

And then when the workshop came, somebody worked on me. I had this vision, a very fleeting vision of Christ on the cross, and then floods and floods of tears came. It's emotional. I still feel it now. And she called me to her and put my head in her lap, and I wet her sari with my tears. And then everybody came up to me. Fergie, I'm sure I remember Fergie coming up to me. And young men, lots of people came up and talked to me. And Ray Harris—I don't know if you know Ray Harris—he's Jewish. And Shri Mataji said, "There are lots of Jews here, my dear. There are lots of Jews."

So it was quite an emotional story, really. I was very, very blessed to be in her presence.

Indeed, yes. And this was about sometime in the summer of 1982, Janet?

Yes, I think it was June. I should remember, but I don't. I'm sure it was summer. Yes. How lucky to have prayed to God. And then God gives you realization on the Monday, and she says that on the Thursday preceding the Monday. I've never looked back since. And always in a crisis or when there's trouble, Shri Mataji is there. She's with me. I'm 86 now and I'm not in good health, but she still looks after me. It is amazing.

It's amazing. You're so grateful for this love and the care and all her attention on her children, all of us, isn't it? It's really amazing. Because earlier this morning, we were talking to Agba from Iran. And now we are talking to you, and you mentioned you are of the Jewish background. And hopefully, cosmically, things get resolved quite quickly. It's a miracle that you'd experience. I mean, being in Mother's lap in itself is such a huge thing, isn't it? That must have been so comforting and reassuring.

Oh, yes. And afterwards, of course, I told all my friends and my family. I just wanted to spread it with everyone. And do you know Vicky Halperin? She was a good friend, and she came along to see what I'd got into. She worried what I'd got into. And then Vicky went in with two feet, absolutely. And then she brought Steve Martin along. So that was changing, really. My brother, he was too into the Jewish religion. He wouldn't understand. And he was a simple guy. He died last year, my brother. But my sister came along, and she recognizes Mother. I put all Mother's photographs around her house and in her car. She recognizes Mother, but she doesn't stick on.

Everyone has their own calling, their own journey, isn't it?

Yes. So that's very individual and very unique. All I can say is I have been very, very blessed. Indeed. Very blessed. And in the later years, I don't go to meetings. I pull my ears, really. But Shri Mataji still looks after me. And Fergie, I've been in hospital recently, I think you know. And he's been visiting me. He's such a good man. And he's doing such wonders now with this concert he's just organized. Did he tell you about it?

Yes. The one in July. Definitely. And you, Sushmina, tell me about you a little bit.

Okay. Well, I'm an Indian. I was born in Calcutta and grew up in Lucknow, which is where my parents are based. And my parents have been Sahaja Yogis, and my younger brother. We used to go to Shri Mataji's birthday pujas in Delhi, where I worked as well. And then Shri Mataji married me to Shankar here in England. So I came to England in 2002.

We thought we would like to live in India. Our two children went to Shri Mataji's school in Dharamshala. We loved India a lot. And I think Shankarji, because of me being Indian, and he was in India before his self-realization seeking God, we thought, okay, we're moving to India, lock, stock, and barrel, which we did in 2011. But as you say, Shri Mataji looks after us every moment. So she brought us there, as my father said, in her hand. She brought us to ISPS, which is International Sahaj Public School. Both of us taught there in the school for a while. For four and a half years, we were there, and it was a big privilege. In fact, one of the biggest blessings of our lives to be part of such a lovely collective and realized souls. And then we came back. We are in Kent at the moment.

And this is a project that we started. Because growing up in India, I'm sure you know, belief in God is not a question. It's just there. There were always books and talks of saints like Kabir Das, Ram Das, so many. And Shirdi Sai Baba. Long ago, my father said—I had read, like you probably have, Arthur Osborne's book on Sai Baba, which is like recollections that Linda Williams has done where the miracles are stated, like Sai Baba lit the lamps with water. Now if you read it with a modern brain, you would think, "Ah, this is to be a fiction. It can't be true." So my papa said, "You have to do things so that people in the future, for posterity, can actually recognize and remember that Shri Mataji actually took this incarnation. She has been on earth as a human being because of what she has done."

So this project started, and it's amazing. It's not just an individual thing because on a collective level, Fergie was a big help in organizing. We did the Golden Memories interviews in 2010 when our elder child was at ISPS and our younger child was at Borotin in the summer. We did another one in 2011, and Fergie was a big help in organizing because England, as you know, is the heart of the universe, but I was quite new to all these yogis of the early days. It was so joy-giving, those interviews, because the vibrations just kept increasing and everyone kept remembering more and more stories as we talked about Shri Mataji. And each story is so unique because you, along with the other yogis of that time, had that personal privilege of spending that time in her physical presence, not just for pujas, not just for Havans, but for a cup of tea, for a chat, for a picnic.

So Janet, this is the project that we're carrying forward and we'd love to hear your stories of your time with Shri Mataji, please.

My time with Shri Mataji? So you went to the public program and then what happened thereafter?

Well, after that, I started going to meetings, but I was still cautious and dubious with my Jewish background. But I knew enough to continue, and everyone was so lovely at the meetings. Later on, much later on, I helped with the Hampstead meeting. I helped Colin Heinsohn. I helped Colin with the Hampstead meeting. At first, it wasn't in the meeting house; it was more in the community center. But I used to go to Swiss Cottage meetings and pujas, of course.

I remember one puja that we went to in Switzerland. It was the time of Chernobyl, do you remember Chernobyl? We were in Switzerland and I remember Shri Mataji saying, "Don't open the windows." In Switzerland. It was that weekend. You asked if I have photographs. I recently moved into this sheltered accommodation last year, and I've still got boxes to unpack because I was ill and this, that, and the other. I've looked, I can't find the photographs, but I remember having a photograph, and Colin was on this photograph that we'd taken at the time in Switzerland when Chernobyl was.

We had lots of pujas with Mother. There was a lovely one in Brighton and then a puja in Margate in Kent. You probably know Margate. We had a lovely puja in Margate.

So the Chernobyl disaster was on 26th April in 1986. So you were having probably a puja after Easter there, isn't it?

Oh, right. Yeah.

Yes. Tell us about the puja in Margate. What was it like?

I mean, it's just incredible, really, in Mother's presence. The people today, the youngsters, they've got their realization and they just follow. They're so deep and intense, but they don't have what we had. We were so blessed. In Mother's presence, all these pujas. Indeed. I'm recalling now, I remember the Brighton and the Brighton people were lovely. The Brighton Sahaja Yogis were lovely. And the pujas we had in Hounslow and Shudy Camps. I remember Shudy Camps. Do you remember Shudy Camps? Is that before your time?

Well, yes, Shudy Camps was before my time. There I made friends with Uma and Raja Nadaraja, who are now in Australia. They had two deaf children; both their children were deaf. Nadia. Do you know Nadia at all?

Yes. We saw her acting in a play. She's wonderful.

Isn't she? Very talented. So I'm still in touch with her. We talk about twice a year. I was very, very fond of them. I recently saw her on the website. John Watkinson has just produced this book. It's supposed to be a wonderful book. I remember John from the early days.

So tell us a miracle that comes to your attention as we are talking.

A miracle? Oh, there have been so many. Where do you start? I should have tried to recall them, really. She has saved me when I've been in trouble and in an awkward situation. She's been there, really.

Oh, I forgot to mention that when I went into the first program in Hampstead with John, all the shoes were outside. And of course, the Jewish people don't take their shoes off. And then I went in, and it was like going into the Holy of Holies. It was just so amazing going into that room where she was. Amazing.

Wow. And what was it that kept you going? I mean, of course, Mother's presence was so magnetic itself. It still is. Just a mere photograph, you look at it and you're drawn to it, isn't it?

It was just so wonderful.

So in the beginning, did you sort of meditate morning and evening or how was it for you? Because there's always this mental argument with our conditionings or with what we know and what we should do. Were you ever in a situation like that?

To meditate? Well, all I can say is in my later years, these years, I don't meditate. I sit for a few minutes, I put the bandhan on, and I say mantras. But I don't deeply meditate. But strangely enough, I said to Fergie, when I just lit the incense just before our talk, just before we started—and I don't feel vibrations so much these days because of all my illnesses and whatnot—but when I lit the incense, there were wonderful, wonderful vibrations.

Yes. Yes. I understand that. Recently, my own mom has not been very well after the physical passing away of my father about two and a half years ago. And she barely speaks, but she's a great devotee of Shri Mataji. And all she said when Shankarji and I visited her in March, beginning of April, was "Jai Shri Mataji." So it is, I think as times go by, it is not so easy physically for yogis like yourselves, like my mom and so many more around the world, no doubt, to be as collective as one would want to be.

I'm not collective. Not physically. But I have the website, the community. So that keeps me knowledgeable and knowing.

Absolutely. And so important as well, isn't it?

Oh, yes. Yes. And it's wonderful. When I got my realization, it wasn't in all these countries. And now, it's in all these countries. Even Russia. I don't know if you saw recently, there were miracle photographs on the website. Did you see that? The ones from Russia with the light over them were just incredible. I couldn't believe it. With what's going on in Russia now, and yet there are so many wonderful Sahaja Yogis. There was light and light covering all of them. It was just incredible.

Indeed. Indeed. Do you remember Shri Mataji, Mother cooking for the yogis when you were there?

I remember going to Chelsea Road. They were cooking there. Shri Mataji didn't cook when I went to Chelsea Road, but they were cooking for Shri Mataji. So this Chelsea Road must have been about 1990, early 90s, do you think?

Yes. Yes.

And we had many pujas with Mother at Chelsea Road. And the first Sahaj marriages took place there, wasn't it?

Yes. Amazing. Yes. Go on, tell us more about it, please.

Well, it was just a very special place and to have Shri Mataji there in person doing pujas... when you think about it now, you can't believe it really. She was laughing, joking with everyone.

And I remember, in the very early days, Shri Mataji was just sitting there and I was concerned. Now she always says in her talks, "Don't worry about your brothers and sisters. Don't worry about your family." But I just went up to her and said, "Oh, my sister has diabetes." She said, "Oh, tell them to take this, that, and the other." Now when I think about it, you have to laugh to think I was just concerned with these little things.

Oh, Sushmina, it's lovely to reminisce and talk to you.

Oh, it's so kind of you to take the time out and talk to us. Thank you.

Oh, it's my pleasure. I haven't felt vibrations like this for a long time. So it's done me a lot of good. Jai Shri Mataji.

Jai Shri Mataji. Thank you so much.

Jai Shri Mataji. God bless. Jai Shri Mataji again and again. Thank you so much. Bye-bye, my darling. Bye.
