London (England)
Jai Shri Mataji. Dr. Hamid, Glenda, thank you so much for joining us this evening to share your journey to Sahaja Yoga and, more importantly, to share how Sahaja Yoga has been used by yourself in agriculture. So if we could just start with these lovely photos that you've taken, Glenda. If you'd like to talk us through them—where were you, what were you doing when you were seeking, when you got your realization, and this particular tour—if you could talk to us about it, that'd be great. Thanks.

Okay, I got my realization in the Maccabean Hall in Sydney, Australia, in 1981. 25th of March—I think there might have been a program on the 23rd as well—but on the 25th of March 1981 at the Maccabean Hall, which was just down the road from where I lived, I attended this program. All I remember was I was sitting right at the front of the hall and Shri Mataji was looking so dynamic. For me, I thought she's definitely holy.

And I was doing Buddhism before Sahaja Yoga, seeking, and I was sitting in a meditation position on the ground, actually. I wasn't even sitting on the seat; there were a couple of us sitting on the ground in the front. And when she was talking, it just seemed so that I knew it already. I got to a stage where I knew that we had to have, or there was, a middle channel inside of us and there has to be an energy there. I got to that level in my seeking, so it all came very realistic when she was talking about it. I felt really nice and then went up to Shri Mataji at the end. Everybody could go up, and she held my hands and she said, "You'll be all right." These words stay in me and have stayed in me for the last 42, 43 years. It was just so powerful.

She gave a little booklet to us. I put that booklet in my flat and I thought, that's going to be for later. I have to get rid of all my bad habits. So it took me about nine months.

Then I went to a program also very shortly after that. It was a program at a yogi's place, and it was a workshop in 1981 on the 29th of March. And there I had my real first experience of receiving my realization. I really felt amazing at this program. They were all sitting on the lawn and we were looking at Shri Mataji. She was giving a speech. The workshop is actually on Amruta and it's a really powerful, powerful workshop if you listen to her talking. This would be 29th March, 1981 in Sydney, so I can provide the links to the video.

She said at the end of the talk, "Now I'm going to go inside. You should all lay on the ground and I'll work on you." And as she walked past me, all I could see was this Christ-like person. For me, it was Christ. She had this beautiful white sari on. I could more or less see her aura, this purity, this absolute purity. She walked past and we all laid down on the ground.

My experience was there's all this black tar coming out through me initially. I felt all this dirty scum from smoking and what have you, all my bad habits. And then suddenly this black, oily substance started to run through me as water. And this water just flowed and flowed. I don't know how long I was laying there, but then they woke me up and touched me. "Are you all right?" And I said, "Oh, I'm just water. I've just turned into water." And they said, "Oh, wow, you've had a lovely experience."

I was 29 when I got my realization. And so we went to Shri Mataji afterwards and she was working on a lot of people who were very ill—a lot of people who had been to Rajneesh, a lot of people who had leukemia, people who'd been to a lot of false gurus. And for me, it was absolutely baffling because Shri Mataji was powering into big, big knots in people's backs, and they were vanishing in front of our eyes. I was just sitting there, and these people would come up and just come up smiling.

I looked at Shri Mataji and I was sitting right next to her. And I thought, I'm with Christ. This is Christ in Galilee. She's healing all the sick in Galilee. And I'm thinking this, I'm with Christ. I'm with Christ. I'm in Galilee. She did a cross on my hand and she looked down at me and she said, "Yes, that's right." And I was blown away, absolutely. I thought, Oh my God, she's read my mind and she's Christ. It's really real. So my experience was quite, quite amazing at the time.

After this cloud nine, it took about nine months and then I was invited to go to the ashram. I said, "Oh, I'd love to go to India. I want to go to India." At the time, Warren was the leader of Australia, and he said, "Well, I'll ask Shri Mataji." Of course, after a couple of days, I got the answer to say I could go. "Yes, you can come. You're ready." So that was the beginning.

This trip was actually one year after, the 1981-82. This would have been 82-83, the year after. The second time I went to India. Beautiful photo. Shri Mataji was laying down after lunch. I thought it was at Dumas' place... yes, it's at Dumas. That's at the temple. She was resting and she was holding this little child. I just thought, Mother Mary with a child. It was just so amazing to take these photos. She was just posing, and I was just there with my camera, taking all these beautiful photos of her laying there with a child. They're so unusual. There are no photos like this. It's beautiful. Aren't they beautiful? Amazing. And she let me take them. I was so, so happy with this.

The times in India, when I remember the first tours, were very, very meditative. We were very peaceful and we felt so connected with Shri Mataji because we were physically with her so much every day. Every day we were bowing down to her lotus feet and literally burying ourselves in the vibrations. She was working on us every day and really looked after us like a mother with her children. It was so powerful.

This is a little bit hard, we're going back 40-odd years. That's me sitting next to Shri Mataji there. These times were like being with Christ and all the disciples sitting around. Shri Mataji talked very personally in these talks. We were always just looking at her feet and her face, her smiles, her laughter. It was so personal. We were so personally with Shri Mataji and she even called us by name. She gave us personal gifts. One of them was little Ganeshas and I've still got it, a little bronze Ganesha. She gave us personally in our hands, we all received this little bronze Ganesha. She gave us Mogra perfumes, saris. We received presents every time we were with Shri Mataji on these tours. And these presents were full of vibrations. I've still got many of these, all of these presents, actually. I kept everything.

This is Shri Ganesha Puja in 1983. You see that Shri Mataji's hands used to be decorated as well. They didn't do that later on, but they always decorated Shri Mataji's hands. They put all the elements on Shri Mataji's hands directly, not on her feet, but on her hands. The five elements went on her hands and then they painted them with kumkum. All of the earlier pujas were like that.

What was a puja with Shri Mataji like then? Very different. One puja I can remember in Delhi on the 82-83 tour, Shri Mataji did a Shiva Puja that lasted nine hours. You didn't move. You didn't go to the toilet, you didn't eat, you didn't drink, you didn't do anything. You just sat there and absorbed the vibrations. Most pujas were meditative. Mantras were said by the Indian yogis, quite different mantras to what we say now. Or chanting, let's say. Especially, I remember the Saraswati Puja where Shri Mataji stood up at the end of the puja. It was a really, really powerful puja. We were given garlands to offer personally to Shri Mataji. She spoke to us. She told us if our vibrations were good. She worked on us. She even has given bindis to us.

This picture that you're showing now, this was at our wedding. The silverware and the brassware she gave to us personally. Each couple she came to, she said, "May God bless you," and she gave us these personally into our hands. She said, "Now look after these things. They're very precious." And I still have them.

Hamid took these photos. This is where I typed up a project that Dr. Sangwe had asked me to type up. I had a typewriter that was given to me, and I was typing very close to these trees. It took me a long time; it was quite a lot of work. That was one of the first projects with Dr. Sangwe and Dumal. You've heard of Dumal. Dumal was one of the first people to work with vibrated water on his property, and he discussed this with Hamid quite a lot.

Dr. Hamid: For me, everything was new. I am from Iran, and in my head, everything was compared with Iran. Iran is so, and Iran is that. I didn't find any big difference between the culture of Iran and the culture of India. This was very familiar to me. What Glenda took so seriously was a normal thing for me because, in our background from childhood, we were used to this atmosphere. There are a lot of people coming and hugging you and giving this and that. That wasn't a new thing for me.

The first time I met Dumal, Mr. Dumal was a very friendly person, and we spoke a little bit. Unfortunately, at this time, my English... I could understand more, but I couldn't say too much. Because of learning German, I could understand mostly English, 80-90% English. But if I wanted to give answers, maybe 30-40%. It was very difficult for me to understand the Indian English. Mr. Dumal has a very, very special accent. To understand him, I maybe understood one of every five words. And, politely, I said, "Yes, yes." He believed I understood everything. Later on, the only thing I understood was that he's a farmer. That was very good for me.

When I came back from India, that gave me an idea. Shri Mataji had spoken of Dumal and one or two other yogis—I was there too—Shri Mataji had spoken about the vibration in Mother Earth. That was the trigger for doing this experiment. I came back from India. Naturally, after one or two years in Sahaja Yoga, I wasn't the same as Glenda explained. I must be honest; I wasn't religious. I wasn't interested in being a religious person at this time. But one thing made me do Sahaja Yoga: Shri Mataji's face.

I was in England in 1979. My sister was there, and I met my husband at the university. Coming back from England, we went to the wrong airport. England had two airports. We had to hurry to the other airport. At this time, there were thousands of pictures everywhere, in railway stations also. From all these pictures... I haven't had any idea who Shri Mataji is.

Shri Mataji was coming on the 27th of September, 1982. And I am the first Sahaja Yogi from Austria. It was absolutely like an invitation. Shri Mataji invited me to go to this program. I am not joking; I hadn't had any idea about yoga or anything in this direction. I am an environment doctor; I don't like it when somebody throws something around. At the time, I came through the railway station and somebody had crumpled up a newspaper. I went down and took this newspaper. It was about 3:30, and I hadn't had any possibility to go eat something. I thought, okay, I'll take this newspaper with me. I went to McDonald's. At 6 o'clock, I had a meeting for my job. So, I thought I'll wait here for an hour and a half or two hours, read this newspaper, and then go to the meeting.

I opened it, and there was a small photo, a very small photo of Shri Mataji. The first thing my attention went to was Shri Mataji. I read what was written. It was very small. It said that today, exactly at 6 o'clock in the afternoon, this Indian lady is doing a yoga program. I suddenly thought, oh, what a pity. I have a meeting at another place. The two places were not too far away from each other, maybe seven buildings apart, 100-150 meters. This was in Vienna.

Three-quarters of an hour later, a friend of mine came to the same place. We had the same meeting together. He told me, "The meeting is canceled because the boss and the two other people coming to the meeting are sick." Suddenly, in my head, everything changed into happiness. Suddenly it came into my brain, at 8 o'clock is the program nearby. I still had the newspaper. I went there and I got my realization. It was the first day. There wasn't anybody. A couple came later. After one year, we were married. We had so many misunderstandings at the beginning because of my poor English.

At this time, I was driving to two or three places for plant breeding, and I had a lot of experiments with different sorts of water. Some had some manual on it, some water came from Russia. A lot of experiments were going on under my guidance. Something came in my head: Why don't you put something with the vibration? My head was that if the vibration influences me, my body—a plant is also an alive thing for me—that it influences the plant also. Without asking anybody, I arranged another experiment. I put this experiment next to two or three other water experiments that I had to do for the company. That was in 1984 on a property just outside of Vienna.

In the lab, I found the vibrated water plants, in comparison to all other things I was doing, were better for me. It came to my idea: Shri Mataji has told us Mother Earth has the vibration. Why don't you use the vibration there and ask Mother Earth to help the plant? That was the idea that came in my head. I spoke very shortly by occasion with Shri Mataji. I must be honest, I couldn't explain what I wanted to do, but I asked her for permission. After I got the okay, I came back. I thought, if the plant is a living thing, and I am reacting to vibration, the plant reacts to vibration also.

I thought about how I must do it. You see there in the middle is a hose, the watering system. Shri Mataji had given me a ring with her photo on it. I took this ring and put it in the hose, and managed it so the water going to the vibrated part went directly through the ring with Shri Mataji's photo. After, I separated other parts for how the irrigation had to be. Slowly, as the plants began to grow, the difference was so big. It was interesting to go there every week and take photos. It's a little bit far away from Vienna. I would go there, take a couple of photos, and I found there was a very, very big difference.

After we finished the experiment, we took the crops and made the photos. I found around a 20% difference, and qualitatively, the vibrated one was much better than the other. I remember I ate both of them and tested it. I spoke with Shri Mataji about all these things, and Shri Mataji was very pleased with this experience and mentioned it a couple of times in India.

Then, in 1985, she told me I have to come to the garden of Pratishtan. She told me I have to travel with her from England. Our leader at the time was very against me and he didn't let me fly with Shri Mataji. I flew alone. In India, Shri Mataji asked me, "Why you didn't come?" I said, "Shri Mataji, I couldn't." I didn't want to say the leader did this or that. I said, "I couldn't, Shri Mataji. The time wasn't possible."

So, I went there. Everybody from every country had to bring some plants, and I had to arrange it in the middle of this desert. You can't put a plant there; a plant is a living thing. Everywhere is stony and very difficult. The architect for the house was Aron, and at this time, the house was only two rooms. One room was for Shri Mataji; in the other room, Aron and I were together. We slept directly next to Shri Mataji. Every single morning, we meditated directly with Shri Mataji. She was sitting there. She gave us tea to drink with her, and we meditated directly. That was the joyful part.

Then suddenly, 300 people came who wanted to work. There were so many people without a common language. They were speaking Marathi and I was speaking English. For every single person, if you wanted them to do something, you had to show them what to do. The first years were very difficult working there. But the nice part was that for every puja, I was allowed to go to the pujas with Shri Mataji most of the time. If Shri Mataji was somewhere and I was in Pratishtan, we would hire a car and go to see Shri Mataji.

One time, they told me one of their experiments was not working. The vibrated part was not as good as the other part. They took me with the car to where the plantation was, and I told them, "The plantation is wrong." The person who put the seed on the ground was a yogi and hadn't had any idea. They didn't want to give the seed into the hand of a non-yogi, but there was a gardener who knew how to do it. One of the seeds was sitting so deep down. Naturally, that was difficult.

This photo is from the 2nd of May 1985, arrival at the airport in Vienna. Our leader had told us we have to take flowers and collect them in a flat, and Shri Mataji would come there. But in my head, I thought, how can she come there and open the door? We have to go and receive her. I took my flowers without telling anybody and came down. Fortunately, the driver couldn't find a parking place there, and he circled two or three times. As I came out, suddenly he saw me. He was so happy. This photo is from exactly this moment. I opened the door. Shri Mataji knew me from Pratishtan and she was so happy. Her first sentence to me was, "There are no parking places here!" Then I opened the door, received Mother, and brought her up. That was a really very nice time.

I must tell a couple of sentences about how the vibration works in the plant. At this time, it was really spontaneous. It just came into my brain: do it. But later on, I studied a little bit more. A doctor is always a little bit curious to find something. When we fertilize a plant, we are taking one of the elements from Mother Earth and making a concentrated thing, and we are adding it to the Mother Earth. The rest is done by the plant. That is what we are doing. We are adding fertilizer, and water solves it, and the plant root takes it.

The vibration water has to do the same thing that the fertilizer does. If we are able to activate the vibration in the places where the plant is, the high vibration influences the earth's clumps. The vibration does exactly what the chemicals do. They are extracting some element that the plant needs from the clumps and giving it to the plant. That is the circulation.

What is an important part is that nowadays we are living in a quantum... I don't know how far your connection with the quantum field is, but it's a very big, huge knowledge. Slowly, the humanity is beginning to understand the complications of Mother Earth and the plant to Mother Earth. I found out that there is an experiment, the observer and the observed. The person who is doing this experiment is an important part of activating the vibration. The observed is the vibration. And in this case, the observer is Shri Mataji, if you put Shri Mataji's photo there. You are giving it directly into the hand of God. That is my experience. If she wants the plant to grow nicely, then she is doing it. If she doesn't want to, then she's not doing it. A lot of people afterwards ask me, how is it possible? At this time, I must be honest, I hadn't had any idea about quantum. Nobody had any idea about quantum 30 years before.

But nowadays, I have to explain my old experiment with new knowledge. I am writing a small thing to explain how the vibration is improving the plant and how it is working.

Interviewer: What should people who want to use vibrations for plants or agriculture do if they don't have a ring with Shri Mataji's photo on it?

Dr. Hamid: Look, I heard in China, one of the farmers, they are putting Shri Mataji's talks on for the plants. They have a loudspeaker, a tape recorder, and they're putting it in the field, Shri Mataji speaking to the plants. Amazing. For me, that was really surprising, how the idea is changing.

When I told you about the observer and the observed... every time I do the meditation since that time, or I do a program, as soon as I tell them we are meditating, the first sentence I say is, "Don't try anything." I don't believe in any type of meditation I did where I didn't use this sentence first. Most of the people are coming with the idea, "I will try." That doesn't work. Because that is not devotion. When I did this thing, I hadn't had any idea what would happen. I did it. I saw the result. Then I began to get interested in it. Unfortunately, most of the people, they are coming and say, "Oh, I tried, this is doing good." And constantly trying... it is the ego working, more than devotion.

Glenda: This was done in 1988. Hamid did a talk at the Rahuri Agricultural College with Dr. Sambhaji Shinde from Pune. I typed the talk and we had given it to Shri Mataji to check, and she wrote all of this. I retyped it. There is a corrected version as well, with her comments in red. This is the handwritten version. It's a quite a long talk, as you can see. That's her handwriting at the back, all of it. It's hard to scan because it's on both sides and very, very thin paper. You can share it with anybody. It's actually on Adrian Verrall's Eternal Moments website.

Interviewer: Remind us, what, when, where, how was this?

Glenda: Ah yes, that's behind the cloth where we got married. You know, they hung a cloth up between the brides and the husbands. That's me.

Dr. Hamid: Ours was the last marriage announced, by the way. I didn't know anything, really innocent. Absolutely innocent. We haven't had such a ceremony in Iran. And Dr. Sangwe... I am sitting, and my hand is in front of Shri Mataji's feet. Dr. Sangwe jumped on me and pulled my coat away. I was so ashamed. We never take it off. And on top of that, in front of a woman! The more ashamed I was, the louder Shri Mataji laughed.

Glenda: We're still together, and we're 41 years married just in February. February the 15th, 1984, we got married. What was really interesting is that up until we got married, I thought I was going to Iran. I thought Hamid was from Iran and living in Iran. I had been to Iran in 1974 when it was a free country. It was fantastic. It was modern. There were modern buses, and people didn't have to wear chadors. Everybody was free. So, I thought, "Well, yeah, Iran's fine." I didn't realize that in 1979 the whole government had changed. So, I was quite surrendered, to be quite honest. But then, afterwards, I was told, "Oh, no, Hamid's from Austria." Gregoire informed us that we would be going back to Austria. After the marriages, I went straight to Austria. I didn't go back to Australia.

I'm Australian, and because Dr. Hamid is in Austria, I settled in Austria. That was quite tough. Shri Mataji said not to go back to Australia. This was a bit of a shock for me because I had all my bank accounts, my job, my everything. I just had to go to Austria, and my parents didn't even know I was married. I wrote them a letter. I said, "Well, first shock is I'm actually in Austria, and I'm married." Poor mum and dad, they must have got the shock of their lives.

Ours were extreme. Hamid was a doctor, a student. I was basically a hippie running around the world. I traveled around the world for seven years, having a great time. I mean, I was a secretary, but I did a lot of traveling before Sahaja Yoga. Seeking, actually. Seeking myself. "Why am I here? What am I born on this earth for? What's my purpose in life?" Being in that hippie era, everybody was the same. They were all seekers. He had books, I had humanity. So, it's a very nice combination. He was a student, and from Iran, the conditionings from Iran... Muslim traditions and I had Christian traditions. So it was quite interesting.

At our wedding in Bordi, it was just like heaven. When I describe our wedding day, we were just lifted up to another level. It was just like gods and goddesses, and Shri Mataji actually said it. She said, "You're all looking like gods and goddesses today." At the end of our wedding, we walked to the sea. We had our garlands, and we were going to offer them to the sea. We said the mantras and the sea was way out. We were nowhere near it. We just stood on the seashore and we said the mantras. We were getting to the last mantra and suddenly the water was at our feet. And we could just walk in with the garlands. It was just unique, a very, very special day.

Dr. Hamid: Let me tell you one thing at the end of our conversation. For me, it was a wonder. One year later, I went to Pratishtan. We saw some roses, the first flower. I was so happy to see one flower. As Shri Mataji said about her realization, opening the Sahasrara, it's like the actor seeing his creation. That is what this flower was for me. I created this flower. And suddenly it came in my brain: This is the first thing in Pratishtan. Take it and give it to Shri Mataji.

I picked the flower, I went up, and I saw Shri Mataji was in her sleeping room. I asked one girl there, I think her name was Chaya, "Can I give these flowers to Shri Mataji?" She went back, and Shri Mataji said, "Come in, come in." I gave them to Shri Mataji, and she held them for a long time. I told her, "Shri Mataji, that is the first flower from the garden." She gave me a small cup with some water in it and told me herself, "Put these flowers in this cup." I put it where Shri Mataji normally comes in the morning to sit down and have tea.

At about four or five o'clock, Shri Mataji called me. "We are going to the theater today. Come with me." But at this day, I was so busy. I told Mother, "Sorry, I am so tired. If I am there, I can't do anything except sleep." She excused me. As she was at the step, she turned back and laughed at me and went inside. She went to the theater. It was around 7:30, 8 o'clock. They went to the theater, and I was alone in the house. Everybody was away. Suddenly, the door opened and 22 Indian people came to get their realization.

I told Aron, "I am sorry, I am so tired, I can't do anything." Aron told me, "I am one year old in yoga, I don't know how I can do this." We guided these people to one of the rooms. I told Aron, "Do it. They are your people, do what you want to do." I came back and sat down where I had put the flower.

I think from tiredness I was dozing. Suddenly, I saw this flower that Shri Mataji had given me come down and go around my head. It went around and went back. I opened my eye, and I had no feeling of tiredness. Finished. Everything had gone. Absolutely gone. I looked around, what happened to me? How is it possible? I refused to go to the theater. I stood up and opened the door. I told Aron, "I can help." I went there to give realization. I waited until 11 o'clock when Shri Mataji came back. As soon as we heard the car, I came down and she began to laugh. She came out and she began to laugh. She said, "Hamid, why you didn't sleep?" I explained the story. She laughed and laughed and said, "I told you, you come to theater."

Glenda: This is when I got the name Gauri, actually. We were going to Australia to see my parents. This was in October 1988. We stopped off in Pune and were staying with the Shinde family. This was the exact time of the Navaratri pujas. He went every day to worship Shri Mataji. At one of these pujas, Shri Mataji asked, "What's your wife's name?" He said, "Glenda." She said, "This is not a good name for her. Or lady from the valley, but she's from the mountain. She should be called Gauri." And she wrote it down. She gave a sari, and she wrote it on the paper of the sari. She wrote down "Glenda," then she wrote down "Gauri," and then she wrote it in Hindi. I still have this framed here. From that time onwards, she called me Gauri. I believe I got the name on the 18th of October, 1988, on the eighth day of Navaratri.

Interviewer: If I could share this study: a project to monitor the effect of vibrations on spruce trees dying from acid rain.

Dr. Hamid: That was the beginning of summer 1985. This was in Austria and Germany. The acid rain was very, very difficult to manage. I offered to do a project in our company, but they didn't accept it. They thought it was too fanatic or something like this. There was a girl from Germany, a yogi named Annegret. She had a piece of forest on her property. She told me, "Why are you not doing the experiment in my forest?"

I went there, and I put round and round her property... she bought us these badges. I knew the mantras, and I put vibrated water everywhere possible. In agriculture, it's a one-year thing. You sow wheat, and you see in summer how it's going. But in a forest, it's not so. You can't see the results very easily. I spoke to the forest director for this place. I told him, "Please don't remove these photos. Let me see if there's any influence on this acid rain." This project was three or four years long. Every year, two or three times, I went and checked it and took samples. After 10 years, we compared this part with all the forest around. This part was much, much better than all of them. The forest director asked me what I had done there, if we could produce it and give it to everybody with difficulty with acid rain. I told him, "I have to have permission from Mother to do something. That is not my decision, that is her decision." The way was very far away, and it was very difficult to drive back and forth to take the tests, so I didn't continue more.

Glenda: We had a lot of badges and we did a lot in Austria as well. We put badges on areas that were a bit... you can stick it on any of the branches. Badges or these little laminated photos also work. You can put them in your plants as well, and water with vibrated water, of course.

Interviewer: Brilliant talking to you. Thank you so much for joining us this evening to share your valuable work on the scientific proven studies you've conducted in various countries—Austria, Germany, India—and the effect of vibrations, the effect of Shri Mataji's photo, and the blessings of Shri Mataji on nature. Increasingly with what's happening with global climate change, we know there is a solution. Thank you so much for being a pioneer.

Dr. Hamid: Thanks to Shri Mataji. You have to see the problem from several directions. One side is that this is a new subject, how you use Mother Earth in this particular manner. But I am pretty sure that later, in India, they will achieve more with this knowledge.

Interviewer: Such a nice blessing from Shri Mataji, and thank you so much for joining us this evening. Thank you so much, lovely to meet you both and to talk to you. Thank you, Shri Mataji, again and again for giving us a solution to these problems that are manifesting big time now. So thank you so much for everything.
