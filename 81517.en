This is a miracle story that's also in the memory book. It's absolutely incredible. I think in the second or third year I was in Sahaj, Shri Mataji wanted to come to Belgium. She was in Paris, and it was that year that she wasn't very happy in France—maybe you remember that. We were preparing, and Bogdan actually came to Belgium to help. Because we had to rent halls and know how many people we would have to accommodate, I decided to ring France and ask Shri Mataji what she wanted—whether she wanted a lot of seekers or just a few of top quality.

There were no mobile phones at the time, so I had to find coins for a public phone. I had about five Belgian 20-franc coins. So I rang Shri Mataji, and suddenly I was out of money, and the machine stopped. I went back to find more coins. In the first part of the conversation about preparing for her arrival, she had said, "You are my eyes, you are my hands, you are my arms." She was speaking like that.

I went to find more coins because I wanted to continue the conversation. I found loads of them, probably 20 more. I put them in and continued the talk. She told me what she wanted, and she said she wanted loads of seekers, not just a few top-quality ones—just loads. By the way, that year was incredible. It was an absolute miracle in Brussels. We had to open a second hall next to the main one, and someone, I think it was Engelbert, was talking in parallel with Shri Mataji. Anyway, that's a detail.

Then, after the conversation, Shri Mataji said, "These telephones are like monsters. They eat all your money, don't they?"

After I put the phone down, an absolute miracle happened. Like a jackpot, all 25 of those coins came out of the machine, one after the other. I had to hold my hands out like that to catch them. I mean, telephones don't do that, do they?
