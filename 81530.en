I suppose I do, really. It's about my younger brother, Peter, who isn't a Sahaja Yogi, and it would be quite a stretch to imagine him as one. About a year after I met Mother, he was taken very, very ill. At the time, Mother used to do national tours. She would go to Birmingham, Derby, Leeds—I think she went to Manchester. She went to my hometown, Middlesbrough, once. She was very impressed with Leeds; I think it's on seven hills.

My brother was taken ill. Maureen and I got a phone call that he'd been given three weeks to live; he had leukemia. We were due to go and see Mother in Leeds then. Maureen phoned Mother, and she said, "Well, you don't come and see me, you go and see him."

So I went to see Peter. At the time, he was 17. He was not a bad guy, but a bit of a terror, a bit of a jack-the-lad. He liked his football and girlfriends and things like that and had just learned to drive. When I saw him, he was like a corpse on the bed. We had asked Mother what we should say to him, and she said, "Just tell him what's wrong with him, and then he has to sit with my picture."

So I took a picture to him, and I told him, "They've given you three weeks to live." It was quite dramatic—it doesn't sound dramatic now—but he said, "Oh, I don't want to die, kiddo." I said, "Well, I don't want you to die either." So I showed him Mother's picture. He gradually got better, and he's still with us now.

He was declared in remission. A while after that, he was taken very, very ill again. They whipped him into the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle, which is the biggest hospital for oncology and cancer. I went up there to see him again. He was in a separate room by himself and didn't really want to see me. As I went in, it felt as if something jumped on my back, like a monkey. I spoke to him for a while, and then we parted. After that, whatever had jumped on me seemed to jump out of him. He got gradually better and better, and they declared him in complete remission.

That was about 25 years ago, and he's still with us.

It's amazing.

That is an amazing story. And there are so many...
