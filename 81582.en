Then she went to work on my relatives who also had diseases. She came again and said, "Come on, you translate." So I moved next to Mother to translate. Then Mother gave realization, and after that, she decided to work on each and every person. People made a queue, and I was in a rush to be treated by Mother, so every time my turn came, Mother said, "Sir, go back. Go to the back of the queue." And I went to the back of the queue.

Then I lost patience and started jumping the queue. I appeared again. "Sir, go to the back of the queue." Mother said this two or three times. At last, there was no one left, only me. Then Mother worked on me. I was so ill that I don't think you can measure time in those situations, but Mother must have worked on me for 40 minutes or so. It was serious, and that's why I had to be the last one. Otherwise, the people in the queue would have had to wait so long.

At the end of those 40 minutes, suddenly, without telling me, she did this... what's it called? A neck creak. And boom, she twisted my neck to one side, and boom—a big noise in the spine. That was incredible. Then suddenly, bang, she creaked my head in the opposite direction. Then, without telling me, she picked up a thing from her handbag called Netranjan—I don't know how to say it properly. It's a kind of very strong eye medicine, and she put a massive amount in each eye.

At that moment, I went blind. Totally blind. But it was so blissful, so blissful that I thought, "I don't mind. I like it. This is fantastic." That was the strongest experience of self-realization; I cannot describe it. Even though I was blind—most people are blind, then they can see. I could see, now I'm blind. But it was absolutely a tremendous experience.

By now it was about 2 a.m. Shri Mataji said, "I'm going to go to Spain tomorrow. So if you want to see me, come very, very first thing in the morning before I go to take the flight." I said, "Fine, of course, I'll come." It was already 2 a.m. "What time shall I come?" Shri Mataji said, "Very early, very early. Please come and I'll see you before going." I said, "Yes, early, but exactly what time?" She said, "Well, early, just come early." I said, "Yes, I understand, but exactly what hour, please?" I thought it was strange that she wouldn't tell me the exact hour for an appointment. So I said, "You see, I don't want to come so early that I wake you up or disturb you. What time do you get up?" Mother said, "I get up at 4 a.m." So I asked, "When shall I come? After you get up?" "Yes." So I said, "That means 4 a.m., isn't it?" "Yes."

So I came at 4 a.m., except I didn't manage to make it. My motorbike broke down—it ran out of petrol—so I had to run all the way to try and get there. I arrived at 5 a.m., pouring with sweat. I banged on the door, and Maria Amelia came and opened it, dressed in her pajamas. "What happened to you?" she asked. I was pouring sweat, and my suit was totally dirty. I had run for an hour to be on time, and I was an hour late. "I'm very late to see Mother. It's 5 a.m., but I'm here now. Tell her that I've just arrived."

She said, "You see, you need to meditate. Sit down." "Okay, so how do I meditate?" "Very simple. You see that photograph there? You just look at it." I was really offended. "I came here to see the lady herself, and you are giving me a photograph. Is this what you call meditation?" She said, "Try it, try it." Well, I tried it. And that really was a very special meditation, even without Mother in person. I must have stayed in meditation for an hour. Then I got up and didn't know what to do, so I cooked Mother breakfast. And I cooked all the wrong diet, of course, because Shri Mataji was on a special diet. Everything I cooked was wrong. Maria Amelia said, "I'm sorry, you eat it." I said, "No way. Give it to her and tell her this is a Portuguese breakfast. She might like it." Maria Amelia said, "All right, fair enough." She took the breakfast to Shri Mataji, and Shri Mataji ate the whole thing, the Portuguese breakfast, even though it was not at all part of her diet. So that was also a special moment.

Then at last, Shri Mataji met me, and she said, "So now can you feel the vibrations?" because I had been meditating. And I said, "No." So Shri Mataji, sitting from a distance of about three meters, said, "All right, what about now? Can you feel the vibrations?" And she was throwing the vibrations at me. My God, that was like a cool breeze and a big wind. And I said, "No." Then she started blowing it. Every time she blew, it was like having a bath. "Can you feel the vibrations now?" I said, "No." By then, Maria Amelia was getting very irritated. "Come on, come on! What's wrong with you?"

Shri Mataji tried again. She blew the vibrations. "Can you feel the vibrations?" I said, "No." Of course, I was feeling it. Maria Amelia said, "I know you can feel it!" And I said, "It's not vibrating. I'm waiting for it to actually vibrate and shake." Maria Amelia said, "Oh, I see. It's a translation problem. The word 'vibration' in Portuguese... you expect it to actually vibrate."
