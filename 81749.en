Letter to Shri Mataji:

Dearest beloved Mother,

On this most auspicious occasion of Makar Sankranti, when calamity has drawn to an end, a new period of a new moon is blessing us, and the Great Sun is moving position to give us the energy we need, we seek your divine Nirmal love.

We humbly pray to you to expand our Brahmanadi more and more so we can become deeper and stronger; to keep the axis of Adhyatma as the most important thing to be achieved, in oneness and unity; to carry the flag of Sahaja Yoga everywhere, in every country of the world; and to celebrate the golden age of your advent on this earth for your children.
