 (England)
I thought today I could start just a little bit of background before going forward with getting my self-realization in London. I currently live in Florida, just an hour or so north of Miami. I'm in a small town called Boynton Beach, very close to West Palm Beach. Before that, I spent 25 years raising a family—three kids—in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and before that, I was in California for many years. There was a five-year stint in California in between as well.

Back in the 80s, or 1980, I was in graduate school. I had been a seeker, like all of you, my entire lifetime—lifetimes, perhaps—and had studied. But I was very naive and very ignorant, especially when I first came to Sahaja Yoga. I was often and only speechless in Shri Mataji's presence. So, unlike many of my brothers and sisters who were asking very deep and poignant questions, I just sat there completely silent. I didn't have that kind of depth, you could say, although I was a very avid seeker and had studied a lot of the ancient scriptures, a lot of the enlightened poets and writers, and a lot of the texts of the realized souls.

In that process, I got very lost following a false guru before coming to Sahaja Yoga. Fortunately, by Mother's grace, I went to a program because I was just miserable and found my way to England. I left America with the attitude that there was nothing here for me; it hadn't satisfied my seeking. Although I didn't know what that seeking was for or was about, I just knew that it was something that I didn't have. So I dropped out of the PhD program—which was a lot of work to get to, and a lot to give up—but decided I was going to continue this journey and see where it took me. I found my way to England, where I was working as an au pair.

Two years before that, while I was exiting a class that I was co-teaching—an extracurricular activity on New Age consciousness—I met this young man who was backpacking across America. We entered into a conversation; he was a seeker, and I was a seeker. He ended up staying and visiting for more than a week. We developed a close friendship and became pen pals, writing for more than a year and a half, maybe two years, about our seeking journey.

I knew that he lived in the UK, and when I was there, I rang him up. He mentioned that he had been speaking for a few months about Shri Mataji in his postcards to me and invited me to a program at Caxton Hall. So I made my way there. This was in the summer of 1981.

I remember very little about what Shri Mataji said. I only recall being amazed that I realized everything she said was true. I had always felt that with so many of the individuals in the field of spirituality that I had come across in my seeking, there was always something that left me wanting—a lot of truth, but a lot of untruth mixed with it. So when I met Shri Mataji on that first day, I was thrilled and very excited that here was somebody who spoke the truth. Throughout her lecture, I remember thinking, "Oh, that makes perfect sense. Why didn't I realize that? Why didn't I think of that?"

After the program, everybody left. I was one of the last to leave. I made my way down to the sidewalk outside of Caxton Hall and saw this group of young people standing about 30 meters away. I had this desire, this thought: "Wow, they seem like such cool people. I’d love to have friends like them." Then one of the yogis walked over and invited me for pizza with the group.

From then on, there was no turning back. I spent all of my free time at any one of the three ashrams at the time. Of course, the first being Chelsham Road. I think Malcolm and Linda Williams, and quite a few others, were living there. There was Earl's Court, where my dear sister Felicity "besistered" me, and I spent my weekends. She had the tiniest little room, about six by eight, and I was literally on the floorboards in the Earl’s Court ashram. Chaya and Reggie lived there, and other yogis. And then, of course, where Mother lived, at Bramham Court Gardens—I think it was called Brompton Court. Jamal, Mio, Rosie, and others lived there as well. I don't think Ray lived there, but a number of other yogis were there too. I spent all of my free time there.

I will fast forward now. There was a wedding with the 16 yogis in Chelsham Road. I had taken my camera to take some pictures of Mother. At that time, I had only been in Sahaja Yoga for less than a month, and I did not recognize Shri Mataji. But I remember at one point going to snap a picture of her—I believe it was after the marriages had concluded. She looked at me. She lifted up her sari and revealed to me her very beautiful, burgundy-and-gold buckled pumps, her shoes. I took a picture of her showing me what appeared to be brand new shoes, having no clue at all what she was doing in that moment.

There is also another photograph from that day, of Olympia sitting on Shri Mataji's lap, that has circulated for many years. There is this halo around both Olympia and Mother, and in that picture, she looks a lot like the Mother with child. It’s a very sweet photograph. That was a huge blessing.

We move forward about a month. The yogis were trying to convince me to return with Shri Mataji on her trip to America. My desire, though, was to move forward to Europe and continue to explore the world. I didn't understand nor yet value the gift that I had been given. I was avidly trying to experience what I was hearing everyone talk about. I didn't feel vibrations. I don't recall feeling thoughtless awareness. But I did have one experience, which I will communicate, even though it did not directly involve speaking with Shri Mataji. It was instrumental for me in recognizing the reality that self-realization bestows upon us.

I had been quite sick. That evening, there was a meeting at the Quaker Friends Meeting House in Hampstead, and I made my way there. I would walk about two kilometers to the train station—I was living in the Twickenham/Richmond area—then get on the train and take a bus to Hampstead. It was a bit of a journey. I was feverish; I was quite sick, but I was determined to get there. While I was there, a yogi worked on me and asked, "Are you foot soaking?" I replied, "No, what’s foot soaking?" I went home that evening to foot soak. Mind you, I had not felt vibrations nor the cool breeze.

That evening, while I was foot soaking, at one point, I looked at Mother's picture—because in the old days, they used to give a Xerox copy on pink paper or green copy paper of the all-aspects photo, which I had put in a frame. I was looking at the photograph through the candlelight, and Shri Mataji's photograph transformed into a mirror. I was looking at myself. I thought, "Oh, this is not real. Am I having a delusion?" I had been feverish that evening. I was looking one direction, then the other, but it wasn't changing; it was a mirror, and I was looking at myself. At that moment, I had the thought: "She is in me, and I am in her." At that moment, my Kundalini soared up, and I felt these tremendous vibrations in the palm of my left hand. I used my right hand, and everywhere I put and moved my hand, these vibrations were flowing. That was the first moment for me; it was a miracle experience, and it empowered me to continue to pursue this.

About a month later, Shri Mataji called all the yogis together in London to give them instructions while she was away on the US tour—I think it was about six weeks long, more than a month. Linda Williams had been trying to push me to go with her, and I had been declining to even consider it. That evening, Shri Mataji spent a good number of hours, three or four hours, speaking to the collective. I imagine there were about 40 or 50 yogis there. She was giving instructions on how to do Havan for America and what gifts to purchase for when she returned and took the yogis on an Indian tour. She met individually with yogis, giving individual counsel.

At the very end of the evening, she asked for "the American girl." I was sitting in the very back and didn't realize Shri Mataji was referring to me. She asked a second time. At that moment, Felicity, who was sitting beside me, started elbowing me in the ribs to say Shri Mataji was asking for me. I raised my hand. She said, "I'm leaving in the morning for America. Can you join me?"

At that moment, the first thought that came through my head was, I wonder if I've saved up enough. Before I could finish the thought, Shri Mataji said, "I've already purchased your ticket."

My mind raced ahead. I wondered, Where am I going to stay? She was going to a number of cities where I didn't know anyone. Before I could finish the thought, once again, she said, "You will be staying with Me throughout the tour." I also had the thought, How am I going to travel to go from New York to Texas to Philadelphia and California? Before I could finish the thought, she said, "All of your expenses will be covered. They are being covered and taken care of. You don't have to worry about any of those expenses, as you will be traveling and staying with Me."

I had already said, "Yes, Shri Mataji." Once again, always in Mother's presence, I was almost forever speechless. Maybe there were a few occasions where I did ask a question, but most of the time, I didn't. I was always admiring my brothers and sisters who came up with these lofty questions to ask Mother about the world; I just didn't have that depth at that point. She instructed a few of the brothers to take me back to the house where I was staying and to bring me back to sleep on the floor of the meditation room where she was living at Brompton Square.

The next morning, I found myself at the airport with Shri Mataji and Sir C. P., and maybe about a half dozen or so yogis—two of them sisters, Felicity and Rosie. I had made a copy of the photograph of Olympia sitting on Mother's lap for both of those sisters as a gift. When I took them out to hand the first one to Felicity, Shri Mataji was standing to my right. She saw the photograph, took it out of my hand, and said, "Oh, is this for Me?" Then Sir C. P. saw the photograph in Mother's hand and said, "Oh, is this for Me?" So he took the photograph from Mother. I gave the second copy that I had made for Rosie, and Shri Mataji saw that in my hand. She handed the first one to Sir C. P. and then I handed her the second one. The next thing, we were on the airplane coming to the States. She was traveling in coach, and I was sitting a ways back.

On that airplane was a contingent of musicians from an orchestra in the UK, going to America to perform. I had put the little black and white all-aspects photo of Mother on the back of the seat in front of me to meditate. The musician next to me, who was in the orchestra, asked about Shri Mataji, got his realization, and asked to meet her. Mother, being as gracious as ever—I had gone up once she had woken up; well, Mother never sleeps, but she had been with her eyes closed—was very gracious to meet him, speak with him, and bless him. I won't forget the joy on that gentleman's face. She was accessible always to everyone.

We arrived in New York and stayed at the Prince George Hotel, if I remember correctly. There was a small group of yogis. I don't recall anybody else being on that flight except Nirmala Modi, Rajesh's sister, who was attending to Shri Mataji. But there were others who also arrived, like Warren. Further on in the tour, others came from Australia, but at that point, there were very few. Marsha, Linda Taylor's sister, was there.

There were two rooms, one for the sisters and one for the brothers. I believe there were four of us in the ladies' room. I don't remember who else was there. I know Kay came on that tour from Australia, but I don't recall whether she was in New York or arrived in Los Angeles. Diane from Australia was there as well.

Shri Mataji did seven programs over seven nights at the hotel. The first programs were at a place called the East West Center. The very last program was at a huge Baptist church in uptown Manhattan. Shri Mataji gave realization to the minister and spoke to him, saying that now he could give realization, or second birth, to all of his congregation.

There were a couple of experiences in the hotel. The first day, she had asked us to all go and reach out to anybody we might know—friends, colleagues, anybody—to let them know about the programs. I had been in a relationship with a young man before getting my realization, and we had separated. For me, staying in London on my own was a way of being on my own, and I just remember thinking to myself, "Put one foot in front of the other, and you're going to be okay." That was less than a week before getting my realization.

I want to say that after realization, I began to see how the divine power and the Deities, the Devas, had been guiding me. We have this notion of free will, but I was beginning to recognize, at least for myself, that every moment I was being directed and guided by the divine power, by the Deities, by the Devas, the angels, and that they were guiding me each and every step of the way to find the Devi in this lifetime.

I don't know if other yogis feel the same way about this, but I really felt at that time that I was completely under this divine direction. It wasn't a thinking thing or an emotional thing. The divine was guiding me in an unconscious way and gave me experiences and thoughts and ideas that dictated my choices and decisions. I don't think I would be here today without the divine having been so powerfully instrumental in guiding me at that time. I don't know what better word to use than "control"—it's not control—but this idea of free will was absolutely not a part of the equation at that time, and remains so to this day.

A little thing: I was on my way to the very first program at Caxton Hall and got to the front doors. It seemed early; nobody was there. I turned and thought to myself—I had no idea who Shri Mataji was—that I should be bringing flowers. I walked back to the subway station, the underground, and bought a bouquet of flowers to offer to the lady who was arranging the flowers on the altar beside Shri Mataji's chair before she had arrived. It was always little things like that that were not of my own volition, my own willpower, or my own thought process.

That being said, I went to notify this young man with whom I had been in the relationship that I was in the US, in New York. I knocked on the door. He answered, "What are you doing here?" I explained and invited him to meet Shri Mataji. He agreed and followed me back to the hotel that day. We got back; Mother had just finished lunch. We walked in the door. I introduced her to him, and him to her. She called him up.

He slipped off his shoes. He was wearing a button-down dress shirt—he worked at the Federal Reserve—and had just called in to say that he wouldn't be coming to work that day. He went down on his knees before Shri Mataji, and she slipped her feet out from under her sari. He bowed down and put his head on her feet. At that moment, Mother pointed to the base of his spine. The room was silent; there wasn't a sound. But as she pointed, we could see the Kundalini pulsating. It was pulsating and rising up to the Nabhi Chakra, where it stopped and continued pulsating. Some of you may have heard this story before: all of a sudden, his spinal column, which was curved, straightened with a loud crack, like lightning. It was so powerfully loud. We could suddenly see the spine straighten. Shri Mataji mentioned that.

He sits up, and she says to him, "I leave next week for Houston. Will you chaperone me?" I remember thinking, "Oh, dear, this can't be happening." I panicked. I thought to myself, We can't be together. I had spent the last month and a half working on myself, on the Muladhara, to reestablish my chastity. I was terrified that we were going to be traveling with Mother together. But he said yes. He accepted her invitation.

He said, "I'm going to go get my things and move into the hotel room with the brothers." There were three brothers staying in that room. She asked me to accompany him to help show him the way and to bring him back. I went with him. Back in those days, we didn't have suitcases or luggage; we had backpacks. He put what he wanted in his backpack, left the job, and left the flat. We went back to the hotel.

We just heard a talk this past weekend, broadcasted statewide during our weekly collective meeting in South Florida—a talk from, I believe, 1980. In it, Shri Mataji talks about how the divine has instilled within us an innate desire to get married. That was not something I had ever been interested in nor thought about. Yet, as we were returning to the hotel, standing under a street lamp about to cross the busy intersection to the underground metro, I felt this powerful energy rising within me. I had this very strong desire to get married. I turned to him and said, "We should get married." It shocked me that those words were coming out of my mouth, but I was filled with joy.

I did not realize that he had sent an engagement ring—sapphire and platinum—for me, which was currently traveling across to England as I had been flying across to America. It did come back, and I still have it to this day.

We went back to the hotel room. He got settled. I returned to Mother's room; she had asked for me. She went to retire to her bedroom for a nap, and I sat to meditate. While I was sitting there, I felt my Kundalini rising very powerfully. I had the thought, Shri Mataji is doing it, and she wanted me to know that she was doing it. At that moment, she called for me. She called my name. So I went in.

She spoke a lot of times. I don't have, like Abdu did, all of these photographs of experiences with Mother that pertain to collective growth or matters. With Mother, for myself, it was generally personal, for the most part. Although I will share many of them, in spite of the fact that they're personal, because I feel that they are really beneficial for a lot of us. She was helping me to grow and transform, and the same lessons that she was teaching me can help others.

I sat there as she was talking about the horrible banking system in America, or speaking about how harsh the hotel shampoo was and asking me to go get her a different brand. I don't think I fulfilled that one; what I picked was probably something equally as bad as the hotel. At one point, she was wearing glasses. She took her glasses off, looked at them, and said, "Glasses are good. They're good."

I said, "Michael and I would like your blessings to get married." She spoke with me about him and myself, and she gave her blessings. Later that week, she took us to the diamond district, the jewelry district in New York City. She instructed him what to buy and how to shop for a diamond. She wanted a specific diamond. It was good that it wasn't more, because we had very little money in those days.

I’ll share this story, though it didn't directly involve Shri Mataji per se. She dropped us off in the diamond district after instructing Michael in detail on how to purchase the stone and make the ring—the clarity, the color, the size, and so on. We spent the afternoon looking. It was a Friday, and it was getting late by the time we found the diamond. We went over to the big jewelry mart building. It was around three o'clock, and most of the jewelers, being of the Jewish faith, had closed for the Sabbath. The place was cavernous and dark, with rows of blue booths lined with plexiglass. We inquired; there was one jeweler still there who agreed to set the stone.

We returned in two hours, which we did. Michael paid him, and he gave me the ring. The moment it went on my finger, my Kundalini came up so strongly that I lost consciousness and fainted. He grabbed me so I didn't hit my head on the marble floor. I remember realizing at that moment that the marriage was done; it was solemnized by the Divine. I knew at that moment I was going to die.

The final public program was at a large cathedral that Mother had spoken in many years later in the 90s, called St. John the Divine at Columbia University. It was a big hall like that, maybe not quite as big. That was the talk where Shri Mataji announced that she was the Holy Ghost, the Holy Spirit. She started to walk off the stage, but stopped, turned around, and declared, "I am the Holy Ghost. I am the Holy Spirit." I was sitting there—Kay was there too, I remember—and I was in awe. There were no words and no thoughts. I was just transfixed that this was the moment of a lifetime.

Most of that tour was spent writing press releases, putting ads in the papers, and securing speaking venues. Nothing had been done. There were no Sahaja Yogis except for Dr. Warlacher in Los Angeles, and Steve Kirby and Christine in Boston. Mother went to Boston for one day. We did have a puja on Staten Island at the home of a relative of Shri Mataji. Gregoire was there. It was Navaratri; I believe it was October, as the tour was in New York for the last 10 days or so in September. There were maybe about 12 or 15 of us at that puja, which I think might have been the very first puja in the United States.

It was a puja to the Goddess, to Durga. I remember the vibrations were so strong; my subtle system couldn't tolerate it. I had been so badly damaged in my seeking with the false gurus. I had studied parapsychology and worked in that field, including at the Psychiatric Institute in Los Angeles, acupuncture clinics, and with healers. I did Kirlian photography. There was a lot of damage on the physical, mental, and emotional level.

I remember finding one of her hairs on the plate of food she had eaten that day, and I saved that piece of hair. When I was with her at one point, I asked Mother if I could keep it, and she agreed. I knew that her hair was bestowed by Lord Yama, the God of Death, and that it was a huge responsibility. She instructed me how to do puja to it every day by cleaning it with coconut oil. I made a little pillow, threading the hair onto a satin pillow in a glass box. Each day I cleaned Mother's hair; she said it was for my protection. In the 90s, there was a call to return her hair, and at that point, I did. I felt it wasn't necessary anymore. We had collectivity all over the country by then, but back in 1981, there was really just not even a handful of us.

We were leaving for a public program, and Mother stopped in the doorway and turned around. I was behind her that time. She just looked at me, tilted her head, and asked, "Who is the false guru that you went to?" She knew I had talked with her about it, but I had never mentioned who it was. At that moment, I mentioned his name. Her eyes grew enormous and full of wrath. I felt like I could just shrivel up and sink into the Mother Earth. She was furious, and she said, "How could you? He's a murderer." Of course, as a naive seeker, we were told that he had been imprisoned for murder because, like so many other great realized souls, he had been persecuted, tortured, poisoned, and crucified. His disciples and followers placed him in that category, and I just didn't know any different.

These were some of the interactions from that time. After she said that, she also said, "The time for suffering is over. Your suffering is over." I asked Mother at that moment, "Why did I have to suffer so much?" As a child, I was quite unwell. We all come from different backgrounds, but mine was specifically: I had run away from home, gotten in trouble with the law, done drugs, et cetera. My father was tremendously unwell, having a nervous breakdown, and as the oldest of five, it was my responsibility to hold it together because my mom was incapable. So, I asked Mother, "Why did I have to suffer so much?" She replied, "So that you could recognize and appreciate the light." Those are the words she spoke.

One time, I was holding a bag of chana. She had always requested that we have a bag of chana at the public programs. We know that Mother ate the chana as she consumed the negativity, the bhoots and the badhas of the seekers in the audience. Growing up in a very Zionist Jewish upbringing, I was terribly misidentified. I said, "Mother, the Jews are just completely, completely lost. Can you please save them—as many as are in this bag of chana?" She just looked at me with a big smile and said, "That could be difficult." She said it as if, Hmm, there were a lot of chana in the bag.

She sent me ahead to California to plan the programs, of which nothing had been prepared. There were no halls, no advertisements. Nothing had been done for the time she was going to be in Los Angeles or Santa Cruz. This was the tour where Gregoire had asked her to please go to Santa Cruz because it was a mecca of seekers. Because of the weather and a number of other things, the area was inundated with false gurus, and his concern led him to ask Mother to go there.

She sent me ahead. She went to Houston, and Michael went with her. I went on to Los Angeles. She had given me the phone number and name of a woman, who I reached out to, and we had a conversation. Then there was Dr. Wuerlacher, who was very busy and didn't have time to get together. So my days were spent researching and booking halls, putting ads in the newspapers, getting a hotel room, and reserving a car. Then I picked Shri Mataji up. I was staying with my parents, and at that time, they were very unhappy that I was no longer in that PhD program and that I was in this, what they thought was, a cult.

There were more Australians that came at that point. Mother had a suite—she had one room, and some of us stayed in the other. There were also rooms for the yoginis and the yogis. Mother did a series of programs in a school auditorium.

We were in the hotel room one day, and she had asked for a hairdryer, which I brought from home. She turned to me and said, "Why is it that your parents are against Sahaja Yoga?" I didn't know how to answer the question. She pointed to her nose and said, "Can't they see I have a Jewish nose?"

There was a lot of attention on me and drama. Shri Mataji told me, "Forget them." She spoke those two words, which are seared in my memory: Forget them. I understood, after years of grappling with how to best do this, that she wanted me to become completely detached, unemotional, and uninvolved, but still maintain the dharma of a daughter. Without maintaining that dharma, I was inviting an enormous amount of negative attention. So I needed to learn how to walk a very fine line between being gracious, civil, responsible, and dutiful, while at the same time being completely detached and emotionally uninvolved. That was a struggle, but I feel like that was a task she had set out for me in this lifetime.

After one of the programs, she had invited some of the seekers back to the hotel room. The next day, she was dictating a press release to submit to the newspapers. A young man who came and attended the program asked Shri Mataji about the big earthquake: "When is it going to come?" She got very annoyed. She said to him with a very stern, authoritative, and strong voice, "Don't ask for it yet. We have too many that need to be saved." It stood out to me because he was asking what seemed like an innocent question, and yet, we could tell from a comment like that all the levels that she was working on.

I owe a debt of gratitude to the Australians who came to Los Angeles at that time. They brought with them 21 cassette tapes, which were the first I ever received, and they were a lifeline. They brought photographs of Mother. Their generosity, their love, and their attention that year, and in subsequent years, were everything. Their support was incredible. My love goes to the Australians for having come on that tour and helped in so many ways.

One last thing about Los Angeles: there was a public program one evening. Afterward, a woman in the back raised her hand. When Mother called on her, or maybe it was Warren, she couldn't speak; there were tears. Mother said to her, "You are smelling my fragrance. Yes, what you are smelling is Me."

Shortly after that, another seeker asked Mother about the Vietnam War and the slaughter of people in Cambodia by the Khmer Rouge. I don't know if the Q&A for that public program was recorded, but what Mother said really made a big impression on me. She asked this woman, "Why are you feeling guilty? Have you killed anyone? Were it your parents or your ancestors who did these atrocities? Why are you feeling guilty?" She was really hammering on how, in America—and I've seen this year after year—the lefashuti (left side syndrome) is one of the greatest problems. Obviously coming from the Mooladhara, this lefashuti, especially in the women, often doesn't budge; it’s so rooted into the subtle system and psyche of America, understandably.

Then she stopped and paused. She then said, "Well, in fact, yes, Americans do bear some of the responsibility. You eat a lot of beef. A lot of the cows sacrifice their lives for you, and they evolve." I don't know if she used the word "blessed." "They have to evolve as well." She made us understand that we do not need to feel guilty for the death of these innocent—or maybe not innocent—souls. But it is through this means that evolution is progressing faster at this time. She said they have to get their realization one day as well. In other words, what I understood from that was that the slaughter of these souls in this country was in some ways sanctioned by the Divine so that these souls could evolve and, at some point, also receive their Self-realization.

The tour ended for me in Santa Cruz. I think Mother may have gone to Vancouver for one day. While she was in Houston, I had flown up to Santa Cruz to do the same thing: find a hall and place ads in the newspapers. Quite a lot of people came—back then, "a lot" was around 50 or 60, maybe 100. We were all sitting on the floor in a hall; it was some kind of yoga studio. A radio station was also broadcasting from the same facility in Santa Cruz. She did three programs there. I don't have a lot of recollections about that time; it was very busy. We were postering, reaching out, and flyering all day.

She had asked Michael and me to remain in Santa Cruz to look after the seekers. We had agreed. She wanted to make sure that he would be able to get a job, which ended up not being as easy as we had assured her. We were at the airport saying goodbye to Mother—just Michael, Mother, and myself. I don't know why the other yogis weren't there; some had already left. As we stood there, she took the bangles off her hand and put them on my arm, saying, "They are your protection. They will absorb the negativity and break so that you don't."

To this day, I am grateful for that. I didn't wear them all until they broke; there are still a few that are in the altar. I take all the new bangles, put them in salt water, and place them next to the bangles Mother gave and vibrate them. I feel they have been a protection, as well as the bandhan, all these years. I feel like the bangles are a gift of the Devi to the women.

Mother came in 1983 again. I'd love to share a story about staying with Mother in the hotel room in San Diego that year. There were very few times that I actually spoke to Mother without having first been spoken to by her. We woke up in the morning, and she asked me to retrieve a sari from her luggage, the suitcase that she had asked for. It was all crumpled; it was badly wrinkled. I offered to iron it for Shri Mataji, and she said, "No, that's okay." But still being incredibly ignorant and unable to bear the thought of Mother wearing a wrinkled sari, I offered again, and a third time.

On the third time, she accepted the offer. I took out the ironing board. Having been a fairly decent person capable of ironing, I proceeded to iron Shri Mataji's sari, except it wouldn't stay on the ironing board—it fell onto the floor. I picked it up, put it back on, and started ironing again. She sat on the bed, just watching with a big smile. I went to iron again, and again, it slipped off. I thought, What the heck is going on? I lifted it up again, a third time, ironing, and once again, there it goes, sliding right off. At that moment, I realized my folly. I pulled my ears and humbly picked up the sari. Mother laughed and said, "That's all right. I'll take it." She went into the restroom. When she came out, there wasn't a wrinkle or a spot; it had been soiled as well, but it looked completely brand new. And once again, I just pulled my ears.

We were returning after the programs in San Diego to Los Angeles that year for a public program. I think it was the following day that we were getting ready to leave the room and drive back up. I opened the door to let Mother exit the room, and she stopped in the doorway. I was holding the door. She wasn't moving; she just stood there. I'm sure some of you have heard this, as it was one of the most memorable moments of all those times with Shri Mataji. She said to me, "Do not listen to anyone who tells you that you are too right-sided. I need you to do My work." Then she said, "I am depending on you. I cannot depend on—" and she started talking about yogis who were left-sided, drinking tea, and other things which we don't need to allude to. But she said, "You have to do My work."

Then she made a promise: "If there is anything you want to do for Sahaja Yoga, I promise you will have everything you need." I think she said, "all the resources you need to do it."

She lived by that promise every day. At least, I've tried. Since then, I've come to understand that my strong desires, which mostly evolve in meditation, are actually Her desires that she is bestowing upon me or giving to me. Sometimes it takes a while for them to percolate and matriculate up into my awareness. It is a process of growth and evolution that these desires have come up in me over the years. I know yogis say we should be desireless, or we shouldn't have an ego, but that's not been my experience. Sometimes these desires get so strong.

I’ll mention one example. It was the Culture of the Spirit Tour in 2013. We were doing a summer family art camp, pre-Nirmal Arts Academy. We had been inviting artists, like Sunde, and many came. I had this strong desire that these great artists should have an opportunity to perform on a world-class stage. Not just for giving realization—yes, that's part of the equation—but it was my desire that they truly experience the glory they deserve, earned by the merits of their artistry.

There were so many times on that tour where the desire was under attack or thwarted—for instance, when we needed funding from the National Council, and it was declined. A couple of yuvas put together an Indiegogo campaign to raise money, and the National Council said they didn't want that to be done. I just remember once again bowing down to Mother, with tears, saying, "I know you want this to be done. I've tried, and I haven't been successful. It's not happening, Mother. You have to do it."

Just as every other time, she fulfilled her promise. Not only that, but I really had a strong desire to give compensation to the artists. I felt it was incumbent upon us to not just reimburse them for their airfare and time, but to compensate them financially. Once again, Mother came through. I was incredibly grateful that she provided all the means to make those things happen. It is as if she knows what each of us is capable of, and we each have our Dharma to fulfill those capacities and use them in whatever way we can for the spreading of Sahaja Yoga.

In my life, it's been raising three children in Sahaj and providing opportunities for seekers and yuvas and brothers and sisters. We each have different functions and roles to play. The development of Ken Jahari was a big part of my life in Sahaj, running children's camps and yuva seminars and puja seminars and health and wellness camps and the Summer Arts Academy, which became the Family Summer Arts Academy before the Nirmal Arts Academy. It wasn't an academy, it was a camp, the Summer Family Art Camp. And now it's Minivashi, but back then it was the Health and Wellness Seminar. So watching those evolve over the last 30, 40 years has really been a gift to me. And again, this notion that to be egoless has also never quite sat in the exact manner, but more that the faculties of our intellect be enlightened and used by the spirit, not that we are controlled by it, but that it is at the bequest of the Divine. Just a slightly different perspective.

I would like to share one other story, which was quite profound and dramatic. I'm sure everyone here has witnessed miracles that Mother has performed. This one took place in Cincinnati; I don't remember the year, but it was in the nineties. She had a public program at an outdoor amphitheater called Eden Park, just outside the downtown Cincinnati area. After the program, she welcomed the audience members to come up and meet and greet. I was sitting on one of the benches toward the front—it was outdoor seating—and I think I was caring for somebody's child while they were attending to Mother.

At one point, this young man, he must have been in his twenties, came up, and he was grossly deformed—probably the most deformed human being I’ve ever seen. He could not stand up straight; he was completely bent over, with his hands pretty much touching the ground. He had a very difficult time walking; it was almost as if every bone in his body was broken or deformed. He went up to Shri Mataji, and she worked on him. I believe she had a few of the others work on him as well, possibly with a candle. I don't remember how long this lasted, but as Mother worked on him, the deformities began to give way until this young man was standing fully erect. Before our eyes, we watched this badly affected human being stand up in his complete potential, his complete glory.

Shri Mataji instructed him to continue to come to the weekly meetings. She asked a few of the yogis to assist him, to give him information about the follow-up. He began to walk off the stage, which was probably about 20 meters, as it was a rather large stage. As he took step after step, he slowly returned to that deformed posture. By the time he got to the end of the stage, he was back in the same position he was in when he climbed the stairs.

At that moment, Mother pointed to him and said, "See, he is unable to forget. It's his memory. He cannot forget the past." She was quite strong about it. That was the gist of it: it's our memory, our conditionings that act through our memory, that control us, that keep us from fully sustaining the advances or the growth that we experience. That was the lesson at Eden Park in Cincinnati.

I’ll just do one more story. My oldest son was around 15, so that would be around 1998. Shri Mataji came to Washington, D.C. Our oldest son, Joshua, had been fortunate to have a lot of opportunities to spend time with Mother. Year after year, he had gone up onto the stage begging Mother to make it possible for him to go to Dharamshala. This one year, at the Center for Ethical Studies in Central Park in New York, he went up on the stage begging her again. She said, "Without your father's permission"—that’s another story for another day, because Michael has not been practicing for many years—she said, "It's just not possible without your father's permission. But maybe I'll... I might have to write him a letter or something like that."

He was attending to her, helping carry the luggage. I think we were on the tram, the trolley, out to the gate to see Mother off. Sir C. P. was there, and Joshua was carrying the briefcase. Back in those days, you could go all the way through to the gate. There was a group—maybe 30 or 40 yogis—who had accompanied Mother to the airport. She allowed each of us to spend time to say goodbye. I went with the three children to Mother's feet, the four of us together. When I sat up, she looked at me and said—she always called me Tracy—"The children are very good. They are connected. You are connected to Me, and they are connected to you."

I understood what she meant. She knew how much I sort of grieved that they hadn't been able to attend Sahaj schools, like the Rome school, Boreton, or Dharamshala. That was always a bit of a sadness within me for them. I feel what she was saying is that when we do Her work, She looks after all those whom we love. I felt that message very strongly.

I suppose we've come to a good place to stop. I wanted to mention that because I hope we can share that with a lot of people who are coming to Sahaja Yoga nowadays: if they can understand the value of being the instrument of the Divine, then the Divine will look after all of their concerns, all of their problems, and all of their loved ones.

Jai Shri Mataji.
