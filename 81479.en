There were lots of them, whole loads of them. It was a very hectic time, and it was great in a way because it definitely showed the power of the vibrations. It was like someone had shone a kind of primeval searchlight onto reality, and you could suddenly see evil manifesting everywhere. It was extraordinary. And it was actually happening at Caxton Hall, not just in private, but at these public meetings. There would be yelping with Mother working on them and everything.

I remember poor Hester. I saw her hiding in the corner at Caxton Hall, shaking like jelly on a plate, poor girl. But I saw a similar thing because, in the early days, Mother told us that people would be shaking before her. One time, on the first India trip, this was at Bharatavidya Bhavan in Bombay. When Mother would give a talk, it would mainly be in Hindi or Marathi, interspersed with a tiny bit of English sometimes. So, us English would sit at the back and just relax and let Mother get on with it until we heard her say, "tanda, tanda, tanda."

Which we knew meant...

"Cool vibrations."

Cool vibrations. We knew at that point she was going to give realization or was giving realization, at which point we'd get up and work on people. Anyway, one time we were sitting there, and then we heard this sound. When we looked up to find out what was going on, there was this fellow in a full lotus position, and he was literally bouncing up and down like a little rubber ball. He obviously had a problem; there was a baddha in him somewhere. He was actually jumping up and down. It was quite incredible. This was in Mumbai. But again, it shows you how powerful the reaction of vibrations can be. Quite incredible.

Mother used to describe it like frogs leaping. Yeah, as I say, that was quite an amazing thing. And do you remember—do you mind me saying something you told me? Pat, I remember you told me that you didn't feel vibrations very much, but people would come up and say, "Give me the experience, give me the experience," and we'd work on them.

Oh, I must tell you that one. That was in one of the villages. It was somewhere around Dulio, wasn't it? We'd done the talk, and then she was giving realization and directed the crowd to come to us also to raise their kundalini. I was trying, and I couldn't feel anything much, but I was hoping it was working. I could hear Gregoire just near me. I knew for a fact he'd lost his vibrations because he'd gotten caught up with an American Seeker on the plane and had just been told off. But I could hear him say, "Jagruti has occurred!" and all this kind of stuff. If he can do it, I can do it.

So anyway, it was working. I'd go through it and I'd say, "Put your hand there." And I'd ask, "Is it cool?" And they'd say, "Yes, it's cool." I went through a whole lot of them. And then one of them sneaked around behind me and put his hand over my head. He said, "Sir, you are very hot." So it shows you it can work anyway, despite everything.

That's hilarious. So, we had great times. And by this time, you had your first puja.

By this time, yes, the first puja before we went to India. We'd been doing them with the famous pujari, Satpal. One of the pujas we did there, which I remember quite profoundly, was we did the thousand names, and we did it in the evening. It was quite cold, but we didn't feel the cold very much. But we did this havan.

That's the one from the photographs.

Yeah. And Mother said, "Look at the sky." And up at the sky, it had all opened up. The sky was full of clouds, except for where we were. And you could see this huge, bright opening. Mother said that was the vibrations. It was quite incredible, because those were the vibrations, apparently, that we'd released through doing the puja. Sorry, doing the havan. That was the last havan we ever did.

You see, we never knew anything about deities. She would mostly talk to us about the deities through children's stories and examples. But when we went to Nepal towards the end of the trip, we bought so many statues. Remember, we got stopped by the customs at the border. We had 37 statues. They were just digging out all these statues, these huge piles of deities, going clunk, clunk, clunk. They were looking for whether we were bringing something illicit, but they just thought, "What are you doing with all this junk?"

We had gone there to meet up with Shri Mataji for about a week with Gregoire, where he was living when he wrote most of The Advent. We spent that time with her and we went shopping quite a lot. Shri Mataji would go ahead of us into a shop and ask all the prices. Then she'd lean out the door and wave us all in and tell us what the prices were. The shopkeeper's face would just sink. We had great fun there.

And we did the Ajwan. Do you remember?

Oh, the Ajwan session, yeah.

Tell us about that, please.

Well, suddenly it was Ajwan time. She was always introducing, always teaching us, always showing new things. We had a fire in his front room—I don't know, it must have been on some bricks or something. She got her shawl, and we all got under it, including Shri Mataji, and we all inhaled the Ajwan.

You shouldn't go out at night after doing Ajwan, ever. And you must cover your head. So we all went to bed with elaborate things tied around our heads.

Yes, after an Ajwan treatment, you should never go out in the night. You shouldn't go out for a while, and you cover your head, even when you go to bed. I think partly you shouldn't get it cool once it's gotten hot. That's right, because it opens everything up. So that was amazing.

Well, the pujas... Shri Mataji got involved in everything. We didn't know anything. If Satpal wasn't there—if you listen to some of the early tapes, there are hours of rustling noises and little commands from Shri Mataji saying, "Just get that thing there... and get this thing... and now do this." We just had no idea.

On one occasion at the Finchley Road Ashram, there was no one who could read Sanskrit at all. For something we were doing, we were outside in the little back garden. In the end, Shri Mataji said, "Well, there's nothing for it. I'll just have to worship myself." And so she read them. By the way, going back to...
