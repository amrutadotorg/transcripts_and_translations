Shri Mataji always used to kiss me because I was quite insecure in those days. My situation was a little unstable legally because of the visas, etc. So each time Shri Mataji saw me, she used to kiss me or hug me.

I just took it for granted, and I was so heartbroken when it stopped. After a while, well, I had to be a grown-up girl and not need any more of Mother's attention and love. But it was quite extraordinary because I felt I had really found my real mother. It was a very personal feeling I had. I needed that very badly, and Mother somehow knew it.

Mother used to cook for us; she used to do everything for us. She would entertain us instantly. When we went to Stonehenge, she bought us all ice creams. We traveled with her in the back of her car. We went to public programs, some of them in the back of her car. When I first came, it seemed like such a normal thing to do. She used to be so sweet, and you always felt that she knew exactly what you were feeling and what you were thinking.

And at a different level, you just knew that she was like your mother. You would imagine the best mother you could ever have, who knew exactly what you wanted and exactly what you neededâ€”like an ideal. For me, it was very moving because I never had this when I was growing up, so it was such a new experience. I really felt like I was reliving my childhood again and was really being looked after in many ways.
