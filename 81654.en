Jai Shri Mataji. Jai Shri Mataji.

Thank you for joining us, Akbar Samiji. It's a real pleasure and a delight to have you with us to share your memories of your times with Shri Adi Shakti, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi herself. Would you like to tell us where you were and what time it was when you got your self-realization, please?

Before I start my story, I just want to thank you and those who are dedicating their life to all these beautiful memories we gathered in Sahaja Yoga with Shri Mataji—our experiences and miracles—for the future generations, so that they can enjoy these experiences. Thank you very much for what you are doing for the rest of the world, for the rest of the seekers of the world.

So my story of self-realization is quite long. I don't know how much time I have, but if I have enough time, then I...

Tell us how old were you and which country were you in, please?

Well, I was 32 years old and I got my self-realization in London.

Right. Just to mention, you are of Iranian origin. You got your self-realization in London. Amazing.

Yeah, but in '74, I came to Italy to study architecture. When I finished my study at Rome University, I worked in Rome for a few years, but then it was too difficult to find a job. I searched for a job out of Italy and found one in Zimbabwe. I heard they were saying that from London there are cheap flights to Zimbabwe because it's a colony of Britain. I decided to go to London and from there, I would fly to Zimbabwe. So this was all a beautiful plan that Shri Mataji did for me.

I came to London and in 10 days, I found a job in Hampstead. I also found a house just 10 minutes from the job and five minutes from the Hampstead hall.

This is 1970?

No, this was '82. 1982.

Okay. Yes, please carry on.

In front of my house was this Indian supermarket. For two years, I was going to work and then shopping from that shop. Before that, for many years, for 20 years, I was searching. I didn't know what I was searching, but I was traveling like mad from one country to another, one city to another. I just wanted to find one person where I could see, "This is the promise that they are saying." Great prophets and incarnations said that the human being is the highest creation of God, but in all my traveling and searching, I never saw anybody in that state. And I was watching myself; I'm not there at all.

So there was so much thought, so much doubt in my life. I didn't want to get married because I was thinking, "What am I going to teach my child?" I mean, for 26 years I studied, I became an architect, this and that, but I'm not satisfied. I'm not happy. I started having a headache every other day.

Every day after work, I used to go to Hampstead Heath Park and walk there and complain to the divine. "Oh God, why did you create me? What can I do? I know something is missing in my life, but I don't know what to do. I'm so tired of searching. Please help me." Every day I would go there for three, four, five hours. I just walked like mad and talked.

So one day while I was walking, I heard a voice tell me, "The thing you are searching for is inside you, not outside." I couldn't move in that moment. I don't know, maybe the voice was Mother Kundalini's voice, Mother's voice. And some movement of that Kundalini must have been there, because for the first time, I felt, "Oh my God, my feet are on the earth." Things happened within me. I was so happy, so content. And I was telling myself, "Okay, if it's within me, I will find it. I'm so tired of searching outside." I don't know for how long, one hour or two, I was just stunned. I couldn't move.

From the next day, I would go walk and say, "What is inside me? What do I have to work on? I don't know what to do." Again, walking and talking with myself. Then I remembered the Sufis were saying, "God is within you. You are God." Then I said, "Oh, I have to find God within myself. Oh God, where are you? What can I do? I don't know how to get in contact with you. I don't understand what I have to search for within me."

Again, I'm walking and talking. Then I remembered that until I was 15 years old, my mother was doing the Islamic prayer, Namaz. And my father was doing it also. I was the good child of the family, so I was doing Namaz.

So were you able to do this Namaz? Because it's done five times a day. But you were able to do it while you were working in London?

No, no. When I was 15 years old, one day I did Namaz and I saw that before Namaz and after Namaz, I'm the same. Nothing is changing. So I left it. Now after many years, I said, "Okay, to find God, maybe I have to do Namaz again."

When I was going down on my knees, I felt in the Void, the vibration was coming out. It was so peaceful and joyful, I didn't want to get up. Then when I put my head down on Mother Earth, I felt so many vibrations in my Agnya. I didn't want to take my head off the ground. I said, "Oh, Namaz should be like this." I decided I would do this exercise just once in the morning. And for me, it was one hour, one hour and a half. I was just enjoying it thoroughly.

Then I said, "Okay, I have to find out about religion." So I went to the library. I took all the sacred books—the Bible, the Torah, and books on yoga—borrowed them from the library, and I started reading about baptism, and different things, and yoga. For two months, I was in this state, doing Namaz, and I was much, much better than before.

And you could feel what we know as Sahaja Yogis as vibrations in your Void and in your Agnya when you would do it?

Exactly, exactly. Now I can describe it, but at that moment, I didn't know what was happening, but I was happy.

So, one day, I felt so thirsty for worshipping God. I felt lonely. I said, "Where do I go to worship God?" I know the church is not the right place, and the mosque is not, but I don't have any alternative. "I'll go to the church." I was living in Hampstead, and there is a church nearby. I went there and saw the door was closed. I said, "Oh God, all the time I see these doors are open in my life, but now that I want to go, it's closed." I went to a second church, the door was closed. I went to a third church, the door was closed. I said, "Okay, God doesn't want me to go to church."

So I came home, and then I went to the Indian supermarket to do some shopping. I was friends with the owner because I had been shopping there for two years. As soon as I put my feet inside the shop, I saw a small picture of Shri Mataji on the wall. A very small picture. Now, can you imagine? This photo was there for two years, but I was not ready to see it. As Mother says, we are like a bird, Dvijaha. First, the mother has to sit on the egg for 21 days. When the chick is ready after 21 days, it breaks the egg and becomes the second bird. So, for those two years, I had to suffer. My headache started, and all those troubles, until I got ready.

I asked the owner of the shop, "Who is she?" She said, "Oh, every Thursday, she has a meeting in this hall, next to your house. Just five minutes walking. Do you want me to take you there?" I said, "Yes, please. Thursday, take me there." And there was this yogi doing an introduction, and he was talking about what is inside. I was so happy to hear something happening from inside because I didn't know what was happening. He was talking about chakras, about these channels of energy, about this subtle system, about Kundalini. Oh, I was flying. When he finished talking, I just jumped up and hugged him, and said, "I'm so happy! Finally, I've found whatever I was looking for."

So then, every Thursday, I would sit next to the cassette player and listen to her talk. Every word of hers... it was like the cells of my brain were rusted, and when she was saying things, they just became alight. I was so happy. For example, she was saying, "You're not responsible. God is responsible." Oh, it felt like 20 pounds were taken from my shoulder.

But you're the eldest child in your family?

No, no. We were five children: one brother, three sisters.

So, I was just so happy going there, sitting first next to the cassette player, and listening to her and trying to learn a few sentences, repeating them in my head so I wouldn't forget. For example, she was saying, "You have to be thoughtless. No reaction. For example, you go to the park and watch a tree, and see for how long you can watch the tree without thinking." So, from the first day, I was doing that. I was on the bus, watching outside, and noticing, "Wow, reaction." I'd go to the beautiful clothes boutiques—and in Hampstead, there are many...

A very fashionable part of London.

Yeah. Looking at these beautiful clothes and seeing if I had a desire, if I wanted them. So, like this, three months passed. Every time I went, after the talk, Sahaja Yogis would come and welcome me and say, "Do you feel this cool breeze on top of your head?" I said, "What do you want? I'm so happy. I found it. What is this cool breeze?" I was not even interested in putting my hand up to see. I just said, "I'm so happy. I found it."

You weren't looking for Ruh.

Yeah. Every time they would come and welcome me. Anyway, this one time, I came back from the center in Hampstead. It was 10 o'clock. At 10:30, I went to sleep. As soon as I put my head down on the bed, with my eyes closed, I suddenly felt like a drop of cool water on my fontanelle bone area. I said, "Oh my God, what is this? This is what they've been eating my head about for three months, 'Do you feel this cool breeze?' Maybe this is that cool breeze."

I felt my body become hot... then the heat stopped. There was no thought. And my attention was completely here. "What's happening here?" I was just lying down, my eyes closed, just enjoying it. I felt so relaxed, not moving at all. Then, this drop of cool water, with a heartbeat, became larger and larger. Boom, boom, boom, boom. After some time, my whole Sahasrara was cool, but the rest of the body was hot.

So, it came down, came down, came down. My head was all cool. I didn't feel the weight of my body. I was watching, not hot, not moving one millimeter. And I didn't want to, because I was so comfortable, so nicely laying down. Then, it came down, came down. As soon as it reached my heart, it was like when you put the TV on and suddenly the image appears. I felt my heart in the palm of two hands. With my eyes closed, I could see this heart, so much light. I could see all the veins, and it was palpitating. I said, "My God, this is my heart. Let me see if the palpitation is the same." I listened to my heart. I said, "The palpitation is the same." So, this coolness stayed a very long time in my heart. Then, when the heart cooled down, as soon as the coolness came out of my heart, this image went away.

Then, it came down, down, down, until my toes. Now all my body was cool. I felt I could fly. There was no weight. It was an amazing time. As soon as the heat went away, the seven chakras started palpitating. Boom, boom, boom, boom. Jetting out heat. I was feeling better and better and better. And I could feel exactly what the chakras were. This was going on and on and on. I was not moving one millimeter.

After some time, I opened one eye and saw sunlight coming from the window. I opened my eyes and said, "No, it cannot be." I looked at my watch. It was three o'clock the next day. So, that means 17 hours, I was just like that. For me, it was 17 seconds. I was out of time. Amazing. I couldn't believe it. Still, I cannot believe it. But, that was it.

This was 1982 again?

That's 1982. Yes. Then I said, "I have to go to work." So I got down from the bed. When I stood up, I said, "Oh my God, what's happening to me? Where are my doubts? Where is my thinking?" It was just like a newborn baby. I remembered what the Bible said about baptism. I said, "Oh my God, this must be baptism. This is a second life for me." I was babbling with joy for four days. Day and night, these chakras were palpitating. And I was in this state... I don't know how to describe it. Less joy. Babbling with joy. And I said, "Oh my God, I have to take this message." I didn't know what was happening. I called the Sahaja Yogis and told them what happened. They were happy. And I said, "Shri Mataji, give me the power. I have to take this message all over, because I know everybody has problems."

So if one may ask, how did you relate to Shri Mataji? And when did you first meet her? What was that first meeting like?

This was after one month. Shri Mataji was in India, so she came back. The first public program was in Hampstead Hall. After the program, Sahaja Yogis went to her and said, "Shri Mataji, we found a Muslim." And she was smiling and said, "Come here." I went and sat next to her. She massaged my forehead and said, "Oh, he's okay."

Then, four days later, I was on the train with her and two more yogis. We were going to Brighton for Buddha Puja. Wow. I was still only four months in Sahaja Yoga, and I was so bubbling with joy because of what had happened. I knew it was because of her. That voice in the park was from her. Now, Kundalini is moving.

So, for five or six days, we were in a small little ashram in Brighton. We were 25 yogis. We did puja to her.

Which puja was that? Do you remember?

Buddha Puja. 1983.

Buddha Puja, 1983. Wow. So, then we washed her feet. We were with her. After that, I said, "I have to start spreading this message." I decided I had to go back to Italy because I had studied and lived there for many years. So, I came to Rome. The leader of Italy came to me and said, "Oh, you have to come with us." At that time, he had a big hotel and restaurant, so a few yogis were working there. I said, "No, I'm an architect." He said, "No, you come."

From there, somehow, Shri Mataji wanted an ashram. We searched for an ashram. Then she wanted a school for small children. Then we started a school. Then she wanted us to go to a new country, do a program for one year, and establish a bunch of yogis. Then we would invite her to come to do a program. My car, in two years, had 200,000 kilometers on it. Wow. Going from one country to another in Europe: Finland, Greece, Turkey, and Italy. At that time, in Italy, there were only 25 or 30 yogis in Rome and a few in Milan. Then we started doing programs.

How long were you in Rome, then? How long did you work in Rome and try to spread self-realization, to share it with the people there?

Well, actually, all of my life, since I got my self-realization. Somehow, I recognized that my destiny is this. I have to give this. I never... I tried to find a job, but somehow, it never worked out. I knew I was good at this—to travel, to give self-realization. In the Rome Ashram, for 20 years, we were taking care of the children. I was dedicating my life to taking care of these children in those 20 years, and traveling and giving self-realization. And still, I'm doing the same. All the efforts to please our Shri Adi Shakti, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, our Holy Mother.

Tell me something. We had an Iranian neighbor, she's a yogini, Mary Majedi, and when it was her turn at our weekly meetings, she would cook. Mary's Iranian dishes were absolutely delicious and mouth-watering. My question to you is, having been brought up as an Iranian with such nice, flavorsome, rich food, did you ever cook for Shri Mataji? And what did you cook?

Yes. Many times I cooked for her, because I was living in Cabella, and I was two years in India where we built a house for her. A couple of times she asked me to cook.

Oh, so you worked on Pratisthan as an architect?

No, no. That first day I met her, she asked, "What are you doing?" I said, "I'm an architect." She said, "One time, you have to build a house for me." Years passed, Pratisthan was built. Then, we were doing a program in Istanbul. For the follow-up, there were about 60 people. There were four of us who went there for the first time. We said somebody has to stay here to carry on the follow-up. I said, "Maybe, since it's a Muslim country, I'll stay." For nine months, I stayed there.

Which year is this, please?

This must be '88 or '89. 1988, '89, you were there in Turkey. We rented a beautiful apartment. For nine months, the door was open, new people were coming, singing bhajans, and meditating. It was one of my best times there.

And were you working there, again, or not?

No, no. I never worked, because this was my work. Really, the divine takes care. We had a contract with the divine. "Okay, Shri Mataji, I'll take your message all over. And I leave everything to you: my children, my wife, my family, everybody." And it really worked. My children were brought up nicely in the school in Dharamsala, and really, for these 42 years, she never let me down. I never worked, I never paid any penny for taxes, still.

Oh, gosh. Okay. Amazing. Now, that is another miracle. A very big miracle in itself.

She organized, somehow, from my marriage, that my wife was from a rich family, so she didn't have financial problems. I wasn't forced to work. So, in these places, I cooked a few times for Shri Mataji, and she loved it, especially the rice, the way we make it. I remember in Cabella, a few times, I cooked for her.

Can you please describe your cooking and what her reaction was? And what was going on in your heart and in your brain? Because when you're totally surrendered, it's a big joy, but then as a human being, sometimes you can have an internal conversation and you have to ask it to shut up and just rise above. Did anything like that happen? Please describe the whole process of a meal that you made for Mother.

Well, about this rice, I must say, when she was eating it, she told them, "Call the cook." It was an Indian cook. The cook came and she said, "You have to make this rice like this." You know, those Indians, they never do.

Yeah, they'll do it their own way, yes.

That's how you made it. That is really special; you cook it in butter, ghee, clarified butter. For the benefit of those who are watching, please describe it to us.

Yeah, this different way of cooking is like, first you boil lots of water. When the water is boiling, you put some salt in and then put the rice in. And before the rice is fully cooked—it's mainly like how you make Italian pasta, al dente. Lots of water, then when it's boiled, salt, and before they say al dente, you have to feel it with your teeth. It's not cooked. The rice is the same. You taste it, it's not cooked still. So, then you put it in cold water.

Ah. It's cold, so it doesn't grow anymore.

Then you put some potato or something in the bottom of the pot, and then put the rice in with a high flame. You have to add one glass of water—it depends on how much rice is there—because it's not cooked, it still needs water. And you have to put a cloth under the lid. This cloth will absorb the steam of the water. So the grains are one by one, not sticking together. That's why Shri Mataji liked it. Because all the starch goes away in the boiling water. So it's very healthy.

What is this material, sorry? What's this material you mentioned?

Any kind of material, a kitchen towel. You just put that under the lid. When it starts steaming, then you cook it for 15-20 minutes with a low flame. Then the rice will cook properly.

Amazing. So, she always loved this. I must say also about this building...

Yes, please.

When I finished the nine months in Turkey, I invited Shri Mataji to come for a public program. She was very happy, and then before she left, she said, "Okay, now come to India. You have to build a house for me." This is the private house in Noida.

Oh, yes, I've been to that house. Beautiful five-story house. It's beautiful, like a museum.

This was after that, must be '89. 1989. For two years, I was there. I went there to India. There was another architect from India, so we were two architects. We went to measure the plot, and then came to her and put a small table for her with the paper. We told each other, "We don't suggest anything, because she knows everything. So whatever she says, we say, 'Ji, Ji, Ji.'"

She started, "Oh, here we put the bedroom on this side. Here is the window, here is the measure, everything. Then put the staircase here." Then something, you could see, could not go there, but we knew. Then she was asking, "The staircase is here, is it okay?" We said, "Yes."

So you said, "Ji, Shri Mataji."

This staircase is good here? "Ji, Ji, Ji, Ji." Then this... I mean, for four or five hours, she was doing everything. And from time to time, she would ask, "Oh, the bedroom, okay, the size of the window, is it okay?" "Ji, Ji, Ji." Then we took that paper and put it to scale. The next day, we went to her. "Oh, bedroom not there. Put the bedroom here. The staircase not there. Put it there. We'll change everything. Is it better here?" "Ji, Ji, Ji, Ji." So for three, four, five hours, we changed everything completely.

Third day, we came again. Fourth day... little by little, you could see, oh, she took a place and was taking light from the sky somehow. We never thought about that. A few things became completely amazing. This went on for 16 days, and the project for five stories was finished.

When the project was mainly finished, then she started criticizing the architects. We knew from the beginning that's why we didn't suggest anything. She said, "Oh, these architects, they have the concept in their head that the bathroom should be there and the staircase should be here." And she brought the example of a woman who has a baby. It takes nine months until it is complete. So the project of a house also, when you want to build, it takes its time. You have to create. Put the staircase here first, then look how it becomes. Then the bedroom there, then change it. Then see. You don't have to have a pre-concept that it should be there, should be there. It was a big lecture for us as architects. And I heard she did all the engineering part also, which bar of steel to put. I mean, she knew everything.

Then it happened that another miracle was buying Cabella. Do we have time?

Yes, please carry on.

So after two years, when the structure of this house was finished, she was in India and she told me, "Come to Milano, I want to buy a castle." I was in India for two years, and then Shri Mataji said, "Come to Milano, I want to buy this castle." So, every day we would go see different castles. After three or four days, we found a beautiful castle. Really a castle. Two floors, high ceilings, you know, paintings and all, 90 bedrooms. The garden was amazing. She asked us, "Do you like it here?" We said, "Yes, Shri Mataji." So she said, "Okay, buy it."

In the meantime, it took a few days to buy it. So she said, "Let's go see other places." We went to see other places, and then this place in Cabella came up. We came to Cabella, and her car couldn't go up to the castle. So she said, "Okay, I'll stay here. You guys go and see." I stayed with her. The others went up. When they came down, Shri Mataji asked, "How is it?" We were kind of confronting. I said, because Cabella was totally destroyed, in very bad shape, "Shri Mataji, it's small and all broken." She didn't say anything. This is another thing I understood from her: she knows every single thing. She just plays with her children and enjoys this play.

So, what happened? She still didn't say anything about Cabella. She said, "Let's go buy some furniture." Wow. We went to a huge, five-story building. One floor was bedrooms, one floor was sitting areas, tables, chairs, one floor was beds. She was just walking, not even stopping. We were with a list: four single beds, this single bed, two double beds here... for three hours, we made a big list. We all thought these were for the castle she said we wanted to buy.

It happened for a different reason we couldn't buy that one. Then, quickly, she said, "Let's go to Cabella," because Guru Puja was coming and she wanted to do Puja in the garden of the castle. So we came. She came to Cabella with the mayor, went up and saw it, and in one hour, she bought it. Then in the Puja, she said, "Oh, these five intellectual people sitting on my head, they want to buy that castle, which was a nunnery. They don't feel the vibrations." She was just... it's amazing.

My God. Her Leela is beyond our comprehension. Another one is buying the Rome Ashram. This was another kind of thing.

Please quickly share with us how we bought the Rome Ashram.

Yeah. At that time, I was the driver for Shri Mataji. One small miracle happened for me. The day before she arrived, I said, "Okay, I'll go buy a suit for myself. I'll go with a new suit to the airport." I went to one road close to my house. The whole road was clothes shops. I didn't like anything and nothing was my size. I reached the end of the road. It's eight o'clock in the evening, so the shops are closing. I said, "Oh, maybe Shri Mataji doesn't want me to buy a suit."

I came back towards my car and it was nearly dark because all the shops were closed. As soon as I reached my car, I saw a plastic bag on my door handle. I said, "My God, who put this plastic bag here?" I waited five minutes, ten minutes. Nobody was on the road. It was dark. I opened it a little bit and saw some clothes. Again, I waited for five minutes. Nobody came. So I put it in the car and came home. It was three suits in my size. Usually, my legs are too short, so I always have to make the trousers shorter. But this was just right.

So, I wore these clothes. We went to the airport, brought Shri Mataji to the ashram. She was there for ten days. On the day of her departure, at two o'clock, she had to leave for another country. I was the driver, ready and waiting. Usually, she would get up, have tea, breakfast, shower, and be ready. Now, it's ten o'clock, and she is still chit-chatting, talking to some yogis. Eleven o'clock... The departure is at two o'clock.

Where were you going again?

I don't remember exactly where she was going. Maybe Germany, maybe Belgium, I don't remember. But two o'clock was the departure. It means at least by one o'clock, we had to be at the airport. It's eleven o'clock and she's still sitting there having tea. We were a little bit nervous. Then she went to have a shower and breakfast. A hundred children were waiting with flowers for her. Now it's twelve o'clock. She came out and was hugging the children, taking flowers.

At one o'clock, she sat in the car and kind of went to sleep. I was going 180-190 kilometers an hour. Then, 10 kilometers from the airport, there was an accident. There was traffic. The cars weren't moving. We put the car in the lane for police and went fast. We reached the airport. As soon as I braked, she just got up. She said, "What's happening?" We put the windows down and the Sahaja Yogis outside said, "Shri Mataji, the flight is cancelled."

She was very relaxed. She said, "Okay, let's go have lunch." Wow. So, we went to have lunch. Then the leader of Italy, he had this advertisement for a big property. He needed to consult her. He asked Shri Mataji, "Can we go to see this place?" because she wanted us to buy an ashram. She said, "Yes, of course."

We came to this place, parked the car, and then she said, "Oh, I have seen it already. You go and see." So we went in. I don't know if you have been there, it's a beautiful place. Exactly right. Many rooms, a big room for meditation, big land, and all these Roman arches. Very nice. We came out and said, "Shri Mataji, it's beautiful. It's perfect." There were two buildings. She said, "Oh, see the other building there also." Because it was too big a property, the owner couldn't sell it, so he made a division to sell it in two parts. We went to the other part, which was not very nice, but she said, "Buy both of them." Wow.

So we bought it. Then, in the puja there, again she said, "These people who are around me, when I want to depart, they get nervous. If that flight was not cancelled, how could you have this ashram?"

So these are many episodes that happened in my life with her that show she knows every single thing. She is just playing. Just enjoying herself.

What was it like? I mean, I can just imagine how you would have felt waiting, ready to drive her to the airport, and she was talking to the yogis. And then that whole drama on the highway with an accident. When you went to see this property in Rome, what were the vibrations like? Because being with Shri Mataji in itself is such a special privilege, such a blissful state. How did you feel?

Well, wherever I was close to her, not even very close, maybe ten meters, there was always this cool vibration. For example, for ten days I was her driver. Every day after breakfast, we used to go to the city. We had an interview with the TV, we had an interview with radio, newspapers, shopping. Then we'd come back to the ashram and have dinner. After dinner, there were always 40 or 50 people with problems, with sicknesses. She would invite those sick people from public programs to cure them. And she was putting her hands and her feet on them. And until the last person was taken care of, she wouldn't go to sleep. It was like a mother. And for sleep, I don't know, she would just lay down for two or three hours. Then the next day was the same. Ten days, it was like this.

Then I used to take her to the airport. We would say bye-bye, and she was going to another country. She was like a flower again. The same thing. All the year through, she was the same. And when we were coming back to the ashram, for three days, we were sleeping. We had to sleep because that vibration that kept us awake was not there. You could see this body was special.

What a special time to be with Shri Adi Shakti, Shri Mataji herself. So in these 42 years, you've described the blissful state when you got your realization and the whole build-up to it. What is your spiritual state like now, after all this time? And how have you kept yourself in a state of balance so you could be a very good instrument of Shri Mataji? Are there any special things you've done particularly?

Well, as I told you from the beginning, I got this message from her. When I was walking in that garden, Hampstead Heath, when I heard this voice that "whatever you're searching for is inside you, it's not outside." Somehow, this was the main goal for me. "Okay, I have to search within myself." That was the key for my ascent, my growth. Because when I look back, I can see it like a seed growing. It was always better and better and better, deeper, and I understood myself better—that I am the image of God. So my attention from the beginning was on working within me.

In this journey of meditation to reach her, to become an image of her, I try always, even now, to get better and better. When I'm in thoughtless awareness... if a few strands of Kundalini are brought up, then our attention is connected during the day also. We can see ourselves clearly. I can see myself. This Akbar sitting here, he cannot do any single thing. I cannot control my heart. How beautifully this heart is working day and night, for years together. Can I do something? No. Can I take care of my liver? No. Can I digest my food? No. Can I take care of my eyes? No. Three hundred billion cells are working in this moment within me. Can I control one of those cells? No.

When you are fixed a little bit here, you can clearly see that this Akbar doesn't do any single thing. From childhood, like a tape recorder, I recorded my ego and superego—that fire is burning, water is cold, I want this, I hate this. But this is a tape recorder. Then when we grow up, we identify ourselves with this tape recorder. But in reality, she is saying, "Whatever idea you have, I put it in your head. Even those people who believe they don't believe in God, I'm putting this idea in their head." Such a huge play she creates. It's huge.

When you get that these are all a play, that none of these human beings in the whole world can move a finger if she doesn't want them to, then you see the war is there, this is there... these are all, the way I understand it for myself, part of the play. Because this time is the most important time in the creation, in this whole incarnation. For billions of years, she has made us grow, become human beings, and now become Sahaja Yogis. Now she wants to see her image. To see her image, one Yogi has to open the door, because then it's easier for the others. Like one fish becomes a turtle, then a turtle becomes this, then becomes that. Now we are Yogis. She is saying, "To make that one Sahaja Yogi the image of me, I will change half of the universe. I don't care. I care about the Sahaja Yogi. I want to see in the mirror that, 'Oh, this is my image.' There is no reaction."

So when you are in that state, you know that this fellow is president of America, this one is from Russia, he makes war, he does this. But we have to reach that state where we can watch them and know that God is working. This is a drama. It's like a movie. In movies, everything has to be there. He has chosen us as an instrument. I'm saying now, God is searching for employees with all kinds of benefits. That if I grow, if I understand this play, if I know I'm the image of God and I feel it—I feel this joy, this peace, this collective consciousness, this knowledge of God—and I watch this whole drama in human beings, I know God is controlling them also. Then I'm sitting next to her. From her eyes, I'm watching the whole drama. It's such a joyful thing to see all of this drama, all these things that are happening.

Our society is becoming more wild because in that kind of difficulty, she wants to see if you are reacting or if you have complete faith that you don't do anything. She is doing everything for me, and outside also, for all human beings. She's running their hearts, she's digesting their food. If she doesn't want the war to happen, just... But she allows it, because she wants to see that one yogi—it can be me, can be you, can be any yogi—that has no doubt. This thoughtless awareness is there.

And now, 54 years have passed since that child has grown up. Now we have to be self-sufficient. We have to be kind of sitting next to her and doing her job. Because in the past, all the religions, they came... God was on one side, religion was on one side, incarnation was another side. She came to say, "Now is integration. Now, you find me within yourself." In the sacrum bone, she's Mother, she's there. She's Mother Kundalini. So we have to worship her. We have to be able to see that the Mother is doing everything within us. Our attention should be inside ourselves. All these deities are within ourselves.

When we start understanding this, then when you see this play of the divine, when you understand the play, then you're sitting in the kingdom of God. Then you are a citizen of Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, Adi Shakti. And you're watching this drama. And you can see really, everything is working out. Every single thing.

I have been coming to London. For a long time, I wanted to come to do this program in the same place I got my self-realization. Somehow, this hall was available, everything worked out. So many Sahaja Yogis were interested to support this. Everything is working out. I'm just enjoying. Every day you go to different shops, give self-realization to the owner of the shop or somebody working there, to the restaurant. It's beyond words. As she says, "Whatever you need, they bring it on a plate for you." It is like this.

But the main thing we have to see is that what we have to develop is ourselves. God created attention within ourselves, but this ego doesn't allow it. It always takes us out. So this attention has to come back. For example, if I'm cooking, for 10 seconds I stop and think, "You cannot cook. She is cooking." And I can see the Kundalini coming up. When I'm eating, "You cannot eat." Then I have to feed all these deities. I have to feed Shri Mataji. I have to love myself. I have to respect myself. I'm the temple of her, the temple of all these deities.

So, the more you bring your attention in... In the evening, I just massage my hands. I feel this hand also is not mine. This foot is not mine. It's all hers. So with love, I do this, massaging her feet. In my head, I ask, "Shri Mataji, allow me to massage you." And I feel the blessing. She's there. She is. In the morning, I'm getting up. I'm 74 years old, my back is a little... but I sit there and put my attention, put my hand on my back. "Shri Mataji, how are you? Are you okay? Happy? Am I doing good? I'm so thankful to you for everything." Like this, I come up to Swadhisthana. I feel I can sit there for one hour, two hours, just enjoying. Always vibration comes up. So, that altar, we have to build within ourselves. And wherever you go, it's you. This has really helped me so far. I'm so grateful to her that she saved my life. I cannot compare before and now. It's impossible.

It is, absolutely. And what a blessing it is that Shri Mataji chose us as her children. In her enormous compassion, because in the olden days, we are talking of hundreds and thousands of years ago, there used to be seekers like you and so many of us now, in different countries, who would leave the ordinary world and go and meditate and do penance, tapasya, to get what we have got so easily. It's all thanks to Shri Mataji. As my father says, she's the all-pervading power of God Almighty. To listen to it is one thing, but to feel it, as you have very beautifully explained, how Shri Mataji has given us this body as the temple of God, and that we have to really look after it. And how she is actually the doer, and she's doing everything. But that recognition in us, and that worship of Shri Mataji in our hearts, inside us—that taking away the attention from outside to inside for our own evolution and for the evolution of humanity is so important.

Thank you so much, Uncle, for sharing your very beautiful memories with Shri Mataji and the miracles that you have shared. Thank you so much. Jai Shri Mataji.

Jai Shri Mataji. Thank you from you also. Thank you. Jai Shri Mataji.
