 (England)
Hello, how are you? It's a real blessing of Sahaja Yoga for all of you to relax, relax well. Because in relaxation, we realize that we are now realized souls, that we have entered into the kingdom of heaven. That we can see the beauty of what God has created around us. That we have become sensitive to His grace and to His kindness and to His love.

It's a seminar that we have arranged, and I am very happy. I always wanted you to arrange seminars so that you all should meet together and live together and understand each other. The seminars on the gross level work out many things, no doubt. But on subtler levels, seminars of Sahaja Yoga mean a lot. It means that a strong nucleus is being consolidated in various places in a country. And these strong holes, or we can say the strong nucleus which is created like this, can form a mechanism by which beams of strong vibrations could flow or could be thrown all over the places. It's a very great task to build up these mechanisms, these divine mechanisms, in different parts of your country.

Let's take it out for a while. For example, Mother Earth has done her job. Wherever it was possible for her, she has created living deities to show that God exists. That you can now test her vibrations and see for yourself how she has worked very hard. She has created all this beautiful universe. She has created you also. She has created the Kundalini within you. She represents the beautiful nature within us. In her company, in her bounties, when you are drenched and you all meet each other, you see for yourself how she blesses all of you just the same. There is no difference between you and any other person for her. But those who are sensitive or subtler people enjoy her much more than you do.

Now, the problem that exists in every country has its own style, I have seen. And in this country also, we have a style of problems which comes gradually; it's changing its form. In the beginning, I found that people were over-aggressive, skeptical, and also could be rude sometimes. It's alright. It makes no difference to me. Now, gradually they started changing over. They are becoming aware of what they have got, what role they are playing, how important it is to be an Englishman. And when I say English, I mean all the English people, not Wales or anything different. And how they have to become part and parcel of the heart of the universe.

Many of you really realize how important it is to be an Englishman. That everything that happens in this country circulates. For example, if this royal wedding had taken place in any other royal family, it would not have circulated so much. Everything circulates from this country. Maybe you may not think much of yourself. You may think, "What is so great? After all, England is like any other country." But you see why people accept so many things from you. Like even a monarch. I mean, most of the countries have thrown away their monarchies. And in this country, it exists and it has a respectable position. And the symbol of a monarchy is still lingering here in a very proud way.

In marriages, the marriages of royal families are already tested and protested, and nobody is interested. And such an auspicious thing should take place here and that everybody should see it. So many countries should watch it and appreciate it and enjoy it, of all the things. It's something surprising. It transcends all rationality, all understanding of even logic. We can say, what is the logic behind it? But if you are enjoying it, you just enjoy it. You don't want to think about it while you are enjoying it. So one has to understand that you are part and parcel of the heart of the universe.

One thing is essential: that you have to be very flexible people. You have to have the flexibility of the heart cells, we can say. Now, the heart has to pump. It has to be strong. Surprisingly, the lion is your emblem. So you have to have a lion's heart. And a lion's heart means he is not afraid. He is the king. He knows he is the king and he lives like a king, like a lion. And Leo, as in astrology, is a man who is extremely generous, lion-hearted, not afraid of anything. There should be no fear.

But in the English language, if you read any word or if you listen to any word, every third sentence will come with the same word: "I am afraid." "I am afraid to say." "I am afraid this is so." This word must be dropped from the vocabulary. What is there to be afraid of? Some people say that this is said because we do not want to hurt other people. There are so many other ways of saying things without hurting others. But what is there to be afraid of? A man who is weak cannot love. Only a strong person can love. If you talk of love, first of all, see whether you are strong enough to love or not. Loving is not an easy thing. Even loving your beloved in the ordinary sense is not an easy thing. You have to have a very strong moral concept. Otherwise, every third minute people start changing their loves. That kind of love has no meaning. You have to have very firm ideas, not only ideas in your brain but built within you.

Very few people can really have a love as Romeo had, I can tell you. It's easy to think that you are a Romeo. It's different. You can think you are the king of England. It's alright. But you don't become that way. So to be Romeo itself, you have to have a tremendous character, a tremendous sense of sacrifice and love and understanding of what you want. You want to love. That's all. Nothing beyond or before. A man when he falls in love, he falls in love forever and ever and ever. If he falls in love many times, it cannot be love. So that experience also is sort of a forbidden fruit for most of us.

So to love God is even more difficult. Without seeing Him, without knowing Him, without knowing His bounties, without getting realization. It is very difficult. But today, that is not the case. But still, you have to have no fear in your mind. Trust. You trust yourself and trust in Him. First of all, try to trust yourself. If you have made mistakes, you have to say, "Yes, I have made mistakes. Alright. So what?" Trust yourself that you can correct yourself. Trusting doesn't mean a blind ego trip. It does not mean that. Trust means that yes, I can correct myself. I can improve. I can do better. Some people think that if you trust yourself, you should never confess anything that you have done wrong, that you should never say that it was wrong and I can correct it. This is a wrong idea. You have to trust yourself by saying that yes, I have done mistakes. I have been doing wrong. I have been faltering. But I can correct myself. I have that strength within me.

Host: Yes, Shri Mataji. It's a lovely talk of Shri Mataji in this seminar in the "Heart of the Universe" in August in Dorset that we listened to just now. And we have Felicity Payman joining us again today. Thank you, Felicity. She is going to tell us the story behind organizing the seminar. And the interesting thing is, the marriage that Shri Mataji talks about is the marriage of the current King of England, his first marriage, Charles with Diana. And the whole story is linked to this seminar and how it came about. So I'm going to request Felicity, thank you for joining us. Would you please recount for us those days with Shri Mataji?

Felicity: So thank you. Thank you for having me for a short session this time. It was August 1981, and we had had seminars in England the previous year. We hadn't had one for a while, and it always had such a strong beneficial effect on the collective. I had a strong desire to help organize another one.

When I first got realization, my parents had a second home in the countryside in Dorset, an old farmhouse that they had been renovating. I had thought when I first got realization, "What a wonderful place this would be to have a seminar." It's in the countryside and has a lot of space around it. But nothing had come about. And then suddenly, I heard my parents were going away for two weeks in August, and the big, large old mill room was completely empty of furniture except for the grand piano. And I felt, "This is our chance. We'll never have this chance again. There's actually space to have everybody there."

So I asked them if I could. They were not positive towards Sahaja Yoga, so there was no way that they would agree for me to have organized a proper seminar there. And I was very unsure how we could make this happen. And then after a strong, very thoughtless meditation, I really felt inside, "It's okay. We'll go ahead and we'll do this." As a preparation, I asked them while they were away if it would be possible to go down with just a few friends and stay for the weekend, which they agreed to. So this gave me the green light to go ahead.

We shared this with the collective. One of the yogis said he would come down and cook for everyone, which was amazing because we would be doing it self-catering this time. And then I was reminded that it was auspicious to give a proper invitation to Shri Mataji to come for the weekend and if we could have a puja with her. It was told to me quite close to the date that we had available, and I realized the only day that I could go to give this invitation would be the day of Princess Diana and Charles's wedding. So I felt, "Oh, I would like to see that, but it doesn't matter. This is the day. I'm working all the rest of the time, I have to go." So I wrote out a simple invitation inviting Shri Mataji and got on the train and went to her flat in London.

Shri Mataji lived in Victoria in Ashley Gardens, in a large flat, and the position of this place was very close to Buckingham Palace. It's very central to the government buildings, and it's literally a five- or ten-minute walk to Buckingham Palace. As I was walking through the streets to Mother's place, they were absolutely deserted. I'd never seen the streets so empty. I realized, "Oh, everybody's either at the palace watching the procession or they're at home watching on the TV."

So I arrived at Ashley Gardens, and I was feeling very nervous to approach Shri Mataji in this way. I arrived and there was another yogi waiting at the lift at the same time. So auspicious. I said, "Oh, you could give Mother the invitation," and he said, "No, no, no, you should do it." So I went, "Okay, okay," but it was good he was there. So we went up in the lift together and he knocked on Mother's door. This photo is actually Shri Mataji opening the door to her flat in Ashley Gardens. And this is what we saw. Mother came to the door. She opened the door and I said, "I've come to give you this invitation, Shri Mataji." And she said, "Oh yes, yes, come in, come in, we're watching the wedding. Come in, come in."

She invited us both in and we sat down. There in the living room, she and Sir CP were sitting on the sofa facing the TV. The service was actually in process in Westminster Abbey where Diana and Charles were getting married. So I sat on the floor beside them and continued to join them in watching the wedding. After a few minutes, Diana made some little mistake, some error. And Shri Mataji kind of looked at Charles and tut-tutted that he was reacting to her making a mistake. And then a few minutes later, he made a mistake. And Shri Mataji went, "Yes, that's better now."

It was amazing that she was watching. Recently, I was reading a memory of what Shri Mataji had said. She actually had said that if she watches something, she can work through all the people who are watching that event. Her vibrations spread through them. So she's watching Charles and Diana, and everyone else who was watching Charles and Diana's wedding, Shri Mataji's vibrations were passing through. She connected to everybody. I thought that was just incredible, how the power of the divine, the power of her and her total understanding of the process, how to reach people in such a big way.

It was the biggest wedding attended and watched. Princess Anne had been married the year before, and there had not been the same crowds or interest at all. But Shri Mataji had said that Diana was a realized soul. And she opened everybody's hearts. And that's why everybody loved her. She just had that magnetism and humility that drew everyone to her. So this was a lovely little bonus that I got to sit and watch. And then when it was finished, I took my leave. It was very special.

Host: Did you write an invitation card, or did you just verbally invite Shri Mataji?

Felicity: No, no, it was properly written. Properly, addressing her as the Goddess and inviting with humility if she would care to grace us with her presence. We would be much appreciated if she would come to the seminar that was being arranged.

In the invitation, I had asked, because I noticed that every time we had had seminars in previous years and a big puja, people got a chance to really clear out in a very deep way. You could feel everybody's hearts open, and there was this great joy in the collective and being together. And then everyone would go back to London, back to their own homes, and gradually, over a very short period of time, the heart would just close over again. And so I desired, I asked if she could make the focus of the seminar "keeping your heart open." And she then talked about how to open your heart. Because it just felt that when the heart is open, so much works out, as Shri Mataji then talked about. The mechanism that Shri Mataji was talking about in that excerpt, and the importance of it all as time goes by, is essentially for Sahaja Yogis to come together and actually relax and go deeper together.

And you really felt that with this seminar. Most people took trains; they didn't have cars. And we were right in the depth of the countryside. This building, Mill Farm, the site of which was in the Domesday Book, had been originally a proper mill with a mill wheel and water running under it. The room that we had the puja in had had all the flour sacks coming down for the grain to be ground.

We were in the midst of this glorious countryside. It's just green fields. It's at the end of a village, across a railway track, sort of a dead end. So it's very silent. On the second floor is the mill room, and it extends right down along that second floor to the corner. That's where the puja was held.

After the puja, Shri Mataji came out and sat on the little courtyard in front of the greenhouse and had tea. All the yogis just laid on the grass. We were just so relaxed and enjoying it. It was a perfectly beautiful, warm, sunny August weekend. We had tents in the garden; there wasn't so much space in the house. So people brought tents and camped. We had two toilets, one bathroom, and 70 people. I counted at one point about 70 people came. Most of the collective were there.

So on the Saturday, Patricia, who was a musician and a pianist, helped us practice a beautiful song one of the yoginis had written called, "I Vow to Thee, My Country." We practiced singing this together with harmonies and also "Jerusalem" to welcome Shri Mataji when she arrived.

On the Sunday morning, I went with somebody in a car to greet Shri Mataji at the station. Being August, I had imagined that the garden would be full of flowers and I could collect a beautiful bouquet to offer her as she arrived. And to my horror, when I went out in the morning, there was like one single, very small rose and somehow nothing else in bloom. I was absolutely devastated because in those days, on Sunday, everything was closed. No shops, nothing. So I scrabbled a little bit of foliage to go with this rose, and we got to the station, and this was just preying on my mind. I'd been looking desperately all the way there to how to augment this miserable bouquet, as far as I saw it.

Then we got to the station, and they had a lot of these beautiful little yellow daisy weeds growing along the platform. I thought, "Okay, okay, here's something." I started picking these, and the station master's wife saw me. I said, "Is it okay?" And she went, "Yes, they're just weeds." So then the train pulled in, and Shri Mataji stepped down. I had this small bouquet of mostly wildflowers to offer to her, which in my mind was nothing compared to what I would have liked to have given her, what she deserved. But as always, loving and gracious, she took the flowers, smelled them, and said, "Oh, what fragrance." I told the little story, and she said, "Even weeds have..." and this is mentioned in the talk. That's the background behind it, which was so sweet. She always responded to love in your heart.

When you were in Mother's presence, it was quite incredible how you were so connected to her. In the house, your attention was with her. If you were in another room, you might be talking to someone, but you knew where she was. You always had your attention there. And her attention was also on all of us. You felt this connection, and you felt like she could read your thoughts. Something that might come into your mind, she would then reference later in a talk or in a personal comment. So there were no secrets.

So, Mother arrived, and we were all waiting in the living room. As she came in and sat down, we started to sing. That was recorded, and if you go to Amrita, you can hear the three songs that we sang. I was re-listening recently, and there was just so much heart and devotion in singing to her. Everyone had had a chance to relax the day before, and here she arrived for the puja. The excitement that you feel that she's here, she's come! The joy that her presence brought when she arrived... you just melted away. We sang, and it was just really special. I remember we sang "I Vow to Thee, My Country," and you just felt so many vibrations. This was her army that she was training up and gathering together to be the foundation stones. So much spread out from England because she came and she settled there.

Host: Just for reference's sake, the seminar that you're telling us about today happened on the 2nd of August in 1981. And the links are all on Amrita, so for those of us who want to, we can enjoy the music or the whole speech of Shri Mataji.

Felicity, inviting Shri Mataji to your parents' farmhouse there, how did you prepare it for Shri Mataji's visit? Because the Goddess herself was coming.

Felicity: I wish I could say I had done more. A lot of attention was on just the logistics of organizing enough food for everyone—suddenly 70 people. We had put Shri Mataji in the special big double room. In later years, we understood much more about how to host Mother and how to host the Goddess in a proper way. Later on, when Shri Mataji started to stay in hotels for seminars, we would actually have complete furniture for her. We had a bed, all the linen, towels, furnishings, paintings, so that when Shri Mataji arrived in a hotel room, it had been transformed. They would take the room a day beforehand so that they could literally transform it so that there was nothing that would disturb Mother, nobody's vibrations from previously. We would clear it out with vibrated water and dhup and all that sort of stuff.

But I have to say that I did not know about those things. So, other than making the room very clean and having lovely flowers everywhere, and I'm sure somebody was cooking special food... well actually, in those days we didn't have special food for Shri Mataji. She ate what we ate, but always a special plate was prepared for her, and she ate first. Nobody ate before Shri Mataji had been presented with her plate. So there were a lot of little protocols that we just didn't know. It was not like growing up in India, and certainly, I did not know myself.

So, Shri Mataji arrived, we started the puja, and she gave this beautiful talk. We actually had a green towel someone had bought to put under her feet. Linda, bless her, had brought this green organza material which she laced with white lace and invited everyone, brothers and sisters, to embroider little flowers on it. It was given to Shri Mataji towards the end of the puja as a gift, and you'll see that she wears it as a shawl.

The vibrations were just amazing. After the puja, at some point, they had organized that from Yetminster, Shri Mataji was then going on to Bristol and I think later Exeter as well. We went into Sherbourne and we went around the Abbey. Mother often did this when visiting somewhere; she would like to go out and either do some shopping or just spread her vibrations around in the air. We were very conscious that this was the first time Shri Mataji had ever visited Dorset. She'd mentioned at another time that Dorset was a little bit left-sided. Thomas Hardy's earlier novels really reflected that kind of left-side melancholy. And you really felt a difference after she had this weekend, that something had lifted. She had cleared it.

So we went to Sherbourne Abbey, and we're standing inside looking up at these incredible stone buttresses that arch up to support the roof. Shri Mataji made this sort of offhand comment, "Oh, I wonder how they made those." I had bought a guidebook because I thought it might be useful, and I started thinking, "Maybe I'll find the answer." And without much delay, Mother then said, "Oh, well, actually..." and proceeded to explain exactly how they had made the buttresses. And I just went, "Oh, of course. Mother's the Goddess, she knows everything. She's all knowledge."

She came on Sunday morning. All the yogis came down on Saturday morning. Bar a few who tried to get onto the train with her. She'd actually said that we shouldn't try to travel with her unless we had been invited. We shouldn't push ourselves forward; if you were meant to travel with Shri Mataji, she would invite you. But two people had stayed behind with the intention of traveling on the train with Shri Mataji to be close. She mentions in the talk that she played a trick on them and they missed the train. So when she arrived, she said, "Yes, you're all here. And I'm sorry about that, but it was a bit too much. I had to play a trick on them." So these two unfortunately missed the puja weekend. It was a lesson: if Mother says something, don't disobey it. There's a reason.

On the Monday, Shri Mataji was traveling on towards Bristol. I was invited to come in the car because supposedly I knew the directions to the station. We got in the car—it was a small car. There's the driver, Shri Mataji in the passenger seat in the front, and myself and two other ladies traveling with her to help carry her things. We drive into the outskirts of Yeovil station, and suddenly my mind is a complete blank. I realize I have no recollection of how to get to the station. I'm just sitting there directly behind Shri Mataji, and you just are so filled with the vibrations of being in the car with her. I was just totally thoughtless. So we're sitting there in silence in the car as it's driving. I think at some point I must have said, "I'm so sorry, my mind's gone blank." And then, after a short time, Shri Mataji herself started giving directions, and we arrived at the station. It was wonderful, because of course she can do everything.

After the puja, there were marriages coming up the following weekend. So matches were being arranged. Shri Mataji was making suggestions as to who could be matched. A couple of couples who said, "Mother, we would like to get married," she said yes to. Later on, she gave the talk about the importance of not matching yourselves. Very few of the matches that did match themselves in those days survived. She explained to us the importance of having a Sahaj arranged match. It's such a different, auspicious, spiritual marriage. She matches people vibrationally, and that's what's going to give you the balance in your spiritual growth.

But anyway, we are on the station. There's this lovely couple, Jim and Hillary, who came into Sahaja Yoga married. They were on the station too. Suddenly, this idea comes in my mind, "Oh, wouldn't it be nice if they had a Sahaja marriage?" And I'm looking at them and going, "Ask Mother." Then I realized, they'll never ask Mother. They're too humble. And this conversation is going on inside my head: "Ask Mother. Ask Mother if they can get married." I'm going, "No, I'm not going to ask Mother. It's not my place." And it just wouldn't stop. I looked at Mother and I felt, "I think she wants me to ask for them." It was such a connecting moment. So I braved up and thought, "Well, if I'm wrong, I'm wrong." And I just said, "Shri Mataji, what about if Jim and Hillary had a Sahaj marriage?" And she went, "Yes, yes, of course!" like it was the most obvious thing. It was so beautiful. But it was an interesting example of trying to be surrendered to what the divine wants you to do, to be an instrument even when you don't really want to be that instrument.

So, Shri Mataji left on the train, and I went back to the house to tidy up and clean up. I was very concerned that I made everything look exactly like normal because my parents would come back and I didn't want there to be any trouble. My mother was a very scary person for me at that time. A lot of things had got broken or damaged because there were that many people in the house. For example, the bed sheets. They had been massaging Mother's feet with Tiger Balm. We weren't clear enough in those days to always absorb the amount of vibrations that was generated when you do puja to Shri Mataji. These vibrations would fill up in Mother's body; she would literally swell up, and it could be quite painful. So often, she would ask certain people to come and massage her feet to rub the vibrations out. At this particular weekend, they had been using Tiger Balm, and she liked you to massage hard. She would say, "Harder, harder." So there was yellow Tiger Balm all over the sheets. I think the toilet seat had got broken. The salt and pepper had got broken. So I went out to town and I replaced everything. In my naivety, I thought, "They'll never notice." I wasn't a householder then, so I didn't realize how you know exactly what every single thing looks like in your house.

I went back up to London, and they came home and went down to the house. And suddenly, I get this phone call from my mom saying, "We'd like to speak to you. We heard that you had quite a big thing down here. And you need to come down and talk to us." My mom was very cross.

Oh, I forgot to mention the important part of the story. After Shri Mataji left, and I was in the house cleaning and tidying up, I suddenly get this phone call from one of the yoginis who was traveling with her. And she said, "Shri Mataji asked me to call you and to tell you, 'Thank you, thank you, thank you. Tell Felicity thank you for the seminar.'" And it was very effusive. I remember feeling, "Oh, why does Mother have to thank me? She does everything." But then I get this phone call from my mother, and I thought, "Okay, this is why Mother said thank you. Because she wants me to know that I did the right thing, that I don't have to feel guilty." I'd always been the good girl. I'd never done anything against my parents' wishes. So it gave me some courage, some confidence.

I went down on the train to meet them. All the way down on the train, I'm like, "Mother, what can I say? How am I going to make this alright?" I was petrified. So I arrive, and there they are. They call me in the living room and have me sitting down in front of them. My mother had this list of all the things that I'd replaced. She said, "The neighbors told us. They said, 'Felicity had so many friends crossing over.'" That's how they knew. The neighbors had ratted me out.

So I sat there, and it was like this beautiful miracle. Mother suddenly put words in my mouth. I'm looking at them and I started to say, "Well, I'd asked you for a few friends. So I came down with a few friends. And then other people heard about it, and it just sort of snowballed, and they all arrived." And then this light bulb went on and I was looking at my mother and I said, "And you know how generous you both are." And they are, they are very generous materially. "And you've always brought me up to be a generous person and gracious, and I just couldn't turn them away." And it just sort of snowballed like that. And they just melted. It was like Mother just gave me the right words to say everything. I said, "And I'm so sorry that things got broken, and I replaced everything, and I tried my best." But they just melted. And I just went, "Oh, Mother." See how she worked it all so beautifully. And that was it. It was finished and done.

We had this lovely seminar. You could see the change in the yogis. By Sunday after the puja, Mother was outside having a cup of tea in the garden, everyone was laying on the grass, and you could feel this depth of relaxation and clearness. Mother had said to us, "When you relax fully and when you enjoy yourself, then the Kundalini comes up," or she said, "I can work through you." And we all sort of went back to London on this cloud. It was a very special weekend.

Somebody said to me recently, "That was the most normal I felt at a seminar." It was just so relaxing. It's really important for us to organize these things. Mother blessed us with the ability to get together. I really noticed the difference when you go up on the Saturday before a puja and you stay overnight. It gives you a chance to really clear out more of the daily stuff that we absorb, and we can then be in the puja better cleared to really absorb. When we absorb on this deep level, it goes out into the atmosphere, it goes out to other people all around us, and we become better instruments. Puja is not just for us, for our personal growth; it's also for the growth of the country and of humanity. Shri Mataji said at one point, "A puja in my presence is worth five years of meditation on our own."

And although she's not here physically anymore, when I've been to Cabella in these last years, I felt that same incredible depth of vibration that we felt in Mother's presence at those seminars. So she's blessing us with her presence in these international seminars in the same way that we were blessed in her physical presence in those early days.

Host: That's a beautiful recounting and recollection of Shri Mataji's visit to Dorset. As a word of advice, maybe, from the wisdom of experience, for yogis attending pujas today, what should they do to benefit most? Because everyday life is so grueling.

Felicity: Just go. Turn up. Be there. The blessing of the seminars is the opportunity to be together with your brothers and sisters. Just sharing with yogis, having an opportunity to hear about their lives, to give your perspective on a challenge in their life, it all helps us clear and grow deeper. Shri Mataji really encouraged our connections to each other, our bonds. In those early years, it was all about creating this sense of family. And what does family do? They visit each other, they talk to each other, they laugh, they enjoy, they share their sorrows together. When we just go to the public programs, it's so nice to see everyone, but you don't have that time to have that depth of connection. So, as she said, "I'm so happy that you organize these seminars to be together." All we have to do is just turn up and be there, and she will take care of everything. She sends people to talk to you that you need to talk to, that you need to learn something from, or that you can share something with. She's there. When we get together collectively, Mother is there.

She said that if you're not a collective person, her attention goes away. At one point, she said this clearly: "When you feel that there is a problem with the collective, know that the problem is with you." And I thought, "Wow." You cannot blame the collectivity for your problems. The problem is with you because Mother's attention is with the collective. So always look to yourself first. If somebody says something personal to you, meditate on it. "Mother, is this true? Do I have this problem? Should I be looking at this?" A mother will tell us in the meditation when we ask in a detached way.

This links back to when she was arranging marriages in Dorset. I had visited a different collective and was close to the brothers there. One of the brothers suddenly said to me, knowing that marriages were coming up, "I don't know whether I should marry you or someone else." I was completely shocked. As far as I was concerned, he was just like a brother to me. I didn't know what to do at all. So when we were in the car traveling to the station, I just wanted to give this to Shri Mataji. It went very silent in the car, and I suddenly felt this was my opportunity. I just said quietly, "Shri Mataji, so-and-so said he doesn't know whether to marry me or this other girl." And I was completely detached, completely surrendered. I had no desire about it.

She was quiet for a while. I felt like she was probing to see where I was at with this. And then she just said, "No, no. You should marry someone who you can talk to." And I just felt such relief. It was finished with. But it reinforced in my being that when you ask something of the divine, if you want an honest answer, you have to be detached. If you have a desire, like if I had thought, "Oh, I'd really like to marry him," Mother might have said, "Okay, go on and do it," because she allowed us to make our own mistakes. But I wanted what was best for my spirit. So that's important. She said to us, "Be careful what you ask for, because the divine... it may not be the right thing for you." Sometimes it's not the answer you would like at the time, but down the road, you'll see why.

Host: Felicity, thank you so much for sharing your beautiful memories with Shri Mataji. They're precious for all of us.

Felicity: Thank you so much. It wouldn't be possible without these glorious times spent with Shri Mataji. I wanted to take a moment to show these. These are the memory books: "Inspiring Recollections of Our Divine Mother." This is book one. There are ten books in all that Linda Williams and everybody put together. They are wonderful bedtime reading, and you really feel that you're there with Mother. They are filled with a lot of practical advice Shri Mataji was giving us for our daily lives—diets, what to eat, how to clear this and that, how to bring your children up. They're not just a record, but a source of knowledge for all of us. They can be ordered through Amazon. You have to do a careful search, but they are available.

Host: And you mentioned all the knowledge, you mentioned about Amrita, the Nirmal Vidya site with the recordings.

Felicity: Yes. Mostly on YouTube, they just have the edited version of the "Open Your Heart" talk from Mill Farm. But if you go to the SoundCloud or Amrita talk, you've got the full 50-minute talk. You don't get the ads. It's a vast source of knowledge for all of us to support our spiritual growth. Thank you so much for having me.

Host: Thank you so much for joining us. Jai Shri Mataji. All our love.

Felicity: Take care. Thank you.
