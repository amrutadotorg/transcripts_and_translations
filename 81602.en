I had been a kind of young hippie—not a very successful one, because I was never any good at making money. But what I did discover quite early on was that you can't discover truth through thought or analysis, and I was strongly attracted to meditation. Various things contributed to this, including some personal experiences. I was gradually so strongly attracted to the idea of meditation as a means of accessing myself, rather than through analysis, that I was drawn to a particular meditation system called TM.

Fortunately, my skills at making money were such that I was never able to go into TM in any great depth, which was quite useful. It allowed me to see a lot of what was going on in TM without actually being deeply involved in it, unlike some others. I spent several years with them, and in the course of that, I met various people who, it turned out, were very active in propagating TM in Scotland. I spent some time at the TM headquarters in Switzerland, where I met these particular people. When I came back to Scotland, I took active steps to try and find out more about what they were doing in their TM academy on the shores of Loch Rannoch. I went up to visit them, check it out, and met one or two other young seekers who were there.

About a year later, one of these young seekers approached me where I was living in Glasgow and informed me that there had been casualties discovered in TM, and that an Indian lady was helping to treat these casualties and correct their problems. She had been invited up to this academy residence on the shores of Loch Rannoch to help these people, and would I like to come along? I thought that sounded very interesting because I was interested in all such things, and I had reason to be questioning TM. I had various cumulative questions about it. Although I was still convinced of the validity of meditation as a means of finding self-knowledge, there were many creeping suspicions and uncertainties.

So the following week, another young TM practitioner and I set off for the Loch Rannoch academy. It so happens the date was resonant with right now, because it was about the 3rd or 4th of July in 1979, a beautiful summer's day like this. We took the train up to Perthshire and walked the last seven miles to Loch Rannoch. This wasn't out of choice or any sense of spiritual adventure; there just wasn't any other means of getting there.

When we arrived, it was mid-afternoon, and the place was very quiet. It was a little residential premises on the banks of Loch Rannoch. My memory is now vague on some details—I remember the most important things, but not many of the fine details. To cut a long story short, that evening, everyone who was there gathered in what had been the TM residents' main meditation room. Chairs had been set out, and my friend and I sat at the back, thinking, "Well, we'll just see what's going on here and observe it nicely." There were about maybe 30 or 40 people in the room, and we got gradually shuffled forward until we were at the front. Shortly after that, Shri Mataji came into the room.

She strode down the room and sat down at the front. She was very smartly dressed, with a very intense presence, but very warm, friendly, welcoming, and authoritative. She said hello to everybody and then spotted us right away and said, "Ah, newcomers!" She put her attention straight on us with a big, broad, welcoming smile. She kind of narrowed her eyes and looked at me and said, "Bad heart." And she got the bunch of people in the room to stand up and put one hand towards me.

(The speaker becomes emotional.)

Excuse me a moment. Sorry, just give me a moment.

(The speaker pauses.)

Right, let me see if I can recapture. Listening to the conversations earlier actually prodded me a little bit in this direction because it's such an enjoyable, pleasant experience to hear all these reminiscences of people that I know and who are old friends and associates over such a long period of time. Right, I'll try again.

So, at that point, these people pointed one hand at me and one hand towards her and began to chant this mantra, the meaning and words of which I didn't know and don't recall. But what I do know is at that point, my heart began to awaken. It wasn't like a profound mystical experience; it was more like a part of me which I had forgotten, awakened. At that point in time, I knew what was missing from TM. And it was the heart. The head was there, the attachment was there—everything an ego could want was there in TM. Except the heart. The heart was missing.

So, it's hard to tell you in those terms what Shri Mataji meant to me at that point, because the experience was really my own internal experience of normalizing. It was something that I already knew inside myself. So, it was an experience of deep, profound relief and normalization rather than any sort of profound mystical experience. Part of the reason that I react like this today is because that same recognition is still innately there: that this awakening of the spirit is an awakening of normalization. It's not a big mystical thing. It's who we really are. It allows you to become yourself.

There were several TM casualties there, which was the reason for Shri Mataji's visit—to help these people. The people who ran the academy themselves were there, and they themselves were casualties. Several of their pupils were casualties. In the course of the next two to three days, Shri Mataji worked with these people and helped to clear them out of possessions that they had accumulated during their practice.

I have subsequently spoken to people from TM who, on hearing about these things, said, "Well, this is the sort of thing that's described by psychologists as being epileptic seizures or convulsions." But from what I saw—and I saw some very specific behaviors—this was nothing of that sort. This was very overt possession of a very intelligently animalistic kind that you could see in the behavior of these people.

In the course of that meeting over two to three days, Shri Mataji and some of the experienced Sahaja Yogis who were there with her gave us very profound and practical descriptions of what Sahaja Yoga was about and how meditation actually worked in your system. It was quite a learning experience. For myself personally, I take it as being one of the experiences that I had to learn, that I had to see, that I had to know about. For me, this was one of those things. It's partly for that reason that I talk about these things, because they're plainly to be known about. This is part of the reality. The possession does happen.

And more importantly than that—much more importantly than that—the Self-Realization happens. The Spirit resides in the heart and awakens and brings wholesomeness and reality to the human attention.
