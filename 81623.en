 (England)
Yeah, we used to come sometimes when we were catching the train; we used to sometimes go back and forth. We'd have tea and cucumber sandwiches. I don't remember being with Shri Mataji. I remember being with her in McDonald's, just on the other side, because I had some sort of moment where I was saying, "Wow, God is drinking Coca-Cola."

I had the same thing. The same sort of vision as you at Ashley Gardens. Mother was moving into Ashley Gardens, and she sent the lad out for a McDonald's. We all had that, the McDonald's.

And Mother was so unconventional. You know how she thinks about alcohol, right? I remember there was this worker, an English worker who worked with her, and she gave him a bottle of black Chivas Regal, which is a rather good brand of whiskey. She gave it to him because that's what was going to make him happy at that point.

When she left Oxted Green, there were a load of guys doing removal stuff for her. And when they left with the stuff they were taking away, on the table, there were about eight or ten guys with bottles of either Chivas Regal or some other Scotch whiskey for them to have one each. She gave them one each, and when the boss found out, he was horrified. He could already hear singing coming from the back of the truck. That was supposed to be gifts for diplomats.

She was inviting all the ladies from the surrounding houses to come and help. And one of them asked if she could smoke, so Mother offered her a really good Habana cigar. You could see this woman was torn between wanting to look cool and accept it, but knowing that there's no way she could smoke a cigar. Mother just called her bluff and laughed completely. And she sort of said, "Oh, no, thank you, that's fine."

He was present at one of their diplomatic get-togethers at the house. He said neither CP nor Mother seemed to have any concept of what alcohol did to people because they just kept filling up people's glasses as fast as they could. They seemed to have no idea, especially CP. Well, alcohol is actually a weapon in the diplomatic service. I saw it in China. Because in China, they have a very strong alcohol, and they make you drink because at some point you can't handle it. And then you are more vulnerable.

I remember that's one time where I was full of sympathy for Pat. That was one of the tests in your life. Because I think at some point, Shri Mataji told you to pour away the bottles of water. I still remember that because I thought, "Gee, this is going to be tough for him." He was brave. But he was brave from the moment when Mother told the people in Gavin's home, "You should drop drugs." And the feeling in the group was, "No way." And then Pat said, "Okay, I'll do it." And I remember that. Until we went to India, to Kathmandu. Well, we met in Mumbai first, and then we went off. That was the only time, because you stayed with Mother, and we didn't see you. That was the first time.

I just remember you sort of on your knees in front of Mother saying, "Forgive them, they know not what they do," or something. It was very dramatic, but you were the only one taking her side. When he said, "I will stop," it was like, paff, the table stirred. Because the group was really not taking the message.

I was telling friends about this white suit because Shri Mataji told me we're going to see the yogis. When I came from the US, I had an American army jacket and jeans, and that's the way I knocked at the door, and the American army jacket was torn. So I said, "Oh my God, we're going to meet the yogis." So I went and I bought a sort of Elvis Presley white suit, and on top of it—I must have been out of my mind—a red bow. And I arrived. In this room, we climbed the staircase, so I took my bow out; I couldn't take the suit off, obviously. But they made fun of me for this for quite some time. And that was, "We're going to meet the yogis, my God, the yogis."

They were a very wild bunch. There was only one or two there that were new, but the whole room was full of the local crowd. I saw them all, and I thought, "Oh my God, what's going to happen here?" Because they were quite a bunch. It was only about the second or third time for me.

Was that during the trip you came over from America in the first place, to meet Mother? No, it must be the second one. I think it's around the 20th of August, 1975. The 15th of September was when we first came. So it must have been the second trip.

I remember going around there, and you were singing, "What a Difference a Day Makes." It was a bit feeble, but I was in such a state. The thing was, it meant so much to you to miss it. Even then, you understood what it meant.

What is sweet is we pretty soon had a feeling of brothers and sisters. I remember my feeling towards Marie Rouget. At some point in the corridor, CP had just arrived, and I was always anxious that we behave correctly. I remember Marie was sort of crying on the shoulder of Shri Mataji in front of CP, and I was feeling so embarrassed, but I was feeling embarrassed as if it was my own sister who doesn't know. My embarrassment was that my own sister doesn't know it's not the time to do this in front of the husband of Shri Mataji. So we gelled together pretty fast, I feel. We were such an odd mixture.

In Oxted Green, I remember Shri Mataji putting all her shoes on the table. Who remembers that? She put, I don't know, X pairs of shoes on the table, and we were around with our hands because she asked us to put our hands towards her shoes. Do you remember? And we were looking so stoned. I was looking at the scene and I said, "Right, now we have to change the world with this bunch." Looking around the pairs of shoes and taking vibrations, and we didn't know actually what it was to take vibrations from shoes.

Pat was saying that Shri Mataji had tried speaking to a politician. Well, lots of them. She tried in her own circles and got nowhere. It was William Whitelaw, wasn't it? She was at a dinner party and was talking to him about how we must change society. And he actually turned around and said, "Well, why? What's wrong with it?" Well, now he would have the answer. But even so, if you're rich and okay, in his view, his life was fine. It was the other people's problem. So that's when Mother said she had to stop looking at those people because she tried with the people that didn't have the human deficit that we had.

This is really the experience I had because at some point we were in Dehradun. And we gave realization to a gentleman who was, at that time we called Joshi, and he was the chief of staff of the Indian Army. Solid. We were in his place, and at some point, he didn't really feel the vibration. And then I asked him, "Ask Shri Mataji, 'Are you the Goddess of the warriors?'" And he asked the picture. And then I saw tears coming out of his eyes. And then I said, "What is the difference?" This is the General-in-Chief of the army. And here, you would be... but there's no equivalent to that. But it's not only England; it's the West. All the guys who are somewhere up the ladder in our country just have too much ego.

So we were very happy to have a few doctors. When they showed up, he was still a student. He was working in a factory. He'd given up; he'd lost confidence in being a doctor. He'd spent too long in Goa on the beach, stoned out of his mind. He wrote his book for all the stone-heads of the world.

Did you notice I spelled the first word in the book wrong? "Foreword." It was spelled F-O-R-W-A-R-D as in forward home. He cringes every time he remembers this. It should be F-O-R-E-W-O-R-D. But I spelled it "forward" as in going home. And the proofreader missed it. Everyone missed it. So there's no way I could promote it with that because it would just be ridiculed by anyone who wasn't a Sahaja Yogi.

Your parents were administrators in Hong Kong. And this was a generation of doers. They were a solid generation. It's like the father of Brian Wallace, the wing captain in the Royal Air Force or whatever. I read a book when I was in the U.S. that inspired Newt Gingrich and Al Gore. It's called Generations. And what they say, and I think it applies to you, is that because the generation of our parents were such solid people—that generation who defeated Hitler, who built the Bretton Woods Institution, engineers, no-nonsense, solid people—because of them, we had the guts to seek. And today, people who throw stones in Brixton or wherever, they don't seek because their parents didn't give them any start.

We took our mum to Cabella two weeks ago. She's 92. And she's so quiet and unassuming. And do you know what she said? "Another world." She's been a Catholic all her life, but she said, "It's amazing. It's so peaceful." So she's got her blessings. My dad passed away. He had a hard time because he was drinking. But you know what happened? The last six weeks, he couldn't drink because he was in the hospital. And he cleared out incredibly. When he died, I arrived just after he died. And it was like this kind of opening above his body into this dimension of complete peace. And I thought, "How the hell did you do that?" This is incredible. He's been drinking his whole life, and he still managed to be taken somewhere half-decent.

He held his hand automatically, and she wouldn't let go. They had a tug of war on the doorstep. She pulled him in. I couldn't see him; he basically was pulled through the door. And she made him sit next to her, held his hand, and talked to him. Some days later, he said, "Is it strange to not be able to get somebody out of your mind?" I suppose it depends who it is. He said it's dramatic. And he got his realization. He felt it. He was sitting in front of the fire saying, "Fire is hot and cold." That must have given you great joy, isn't it? Well, it was temporary because he fell back, partly because of my mum's tactics. She freaked out. But she's changed a lot. All through the years, she's had these strange aches going up through her body and gone to the doctor. The last one was pressure on her head. She used to sit with frozen peas trying to relieve it. She's changed a lot. She's still only open a little bit, but she helps us all the time.

Catholicism... there are many commonalities which I found out when I read this book. I also explored the attic of the convent, and I also hated boarding school. I still remember my first night in boarding school. I was like that in the sheets; it was glacial. But dealing with Catholicism is something... I think the first big confrontation between our maker and the church was at the marriage of my brother. Arnaud married Maria Medea, who is Portuguese, Catholic, traditional. So there was a Catholic marriage. And the entire family were sort of, "Who is this lady?" And we were sort of hugging Shri Mataji. The priest was like this. And I read from the book of the Apocalypse in the church. It was quite dramatic.

You said you didn't meet Shri Mataji at the same time. Had you met her somewhere other than England? No, I met her in England. It was quite a story, I must say. I heard about her in Berkeley because there was a student called Rajesh Shah who was there. There was an Indian boy from Bombay in the Johns Hopkins University where I studied. So when I went to Berkeley, I went in the flat of Rajesh, and there were a couple of people who were stoned. Rajesh was sort of watching it. I remember one exited the flat, crawling.

Anyway, he started speaking to me about Shri Mataji. And he wanted to give me my realization. I said, "No way. Who do you think you are?" I was not going to get my realization from this guy. And then he told me about Shri Mataji. He told me she was Sita. She was Radha. She was the Virgin Mary. That blew me off. The guy was not stupid, so I said, "Well, then I need to change."

Then I flew to London. I had a friend in London who was a Lifeguard of the Queen. Two years earlier, I had visited him in Cambridge, and he picked me up at the airport. He was a really sweet boy. I was in the car, and he tells me, "Grégoire, I have an affair. I hope you don't mind." I said, "Of course I don't mind. Why should I mind?" He has a girlfriend. Then, I was in the back of the car, and he said, "Well, I'm sure you'd like Richard." And I was like, "Oh, shit." I wasn't really prepared for that. We were moving into another cultural, sort of interesting development.

So when I came back to see Shri Mataji, I stopped at this flat. And this boy who was cute and was really sweet and everything, he looked like the portrait of Dorian Gray. You could see he was sort of... So it's from that flat that I called Shri Mataji. I still remember her voice. Her voice was like coming from the clouds. I was in that flat, and there were a couple of guys around. It was really weird, man. And then I had that voice who came from somewhere else. And she said, "Yeah, sure, come and meet me. I'm waiting for you."

And then I went. I remember I went to this house where we are going, and I rang the bell. She was all dressed in white, and I was all scruffy, of course. So, I tried to look like I had some education, so I actually kissed her hand. And she said, "May God bless you." And that's the way it started. And then at some point, she told me, "I will have to test you." And then I burst into laughter. "You can test me?" Because I didn't know what it meant. In those days, we thought we could not do anything wrong.

I just remembered that I kissed her hand as well the first time I met her. That's why, I suppose, then, as she walked out, she turned around and blew me that kiss. As she walked past me, I just grabbed her hand and kissed her. His son, she said, "He's like a Roman soldier." Remember, Kevin? And she said, "Look at him. He's like a Roman soldier." He was quite remarkable when he was young. One day, in my parents' car, he was sitting in the back. We're driving through the countryside, and he said, "I think God gave me an extra eye."

This is now what I think is really the priority. I didn't turn out to Cabella this year because I didn't want to have to chat with everybody and explain what's going to happen and what is to be arranged. And committees and all this nonsense. Because we need to try to imbibe what it means that she goes from the Sakara to the Nirakara. Otherwise, if this doesn't happen, then what? Then we are going to spread the numbers like the Catholics and the Sunnis. And then we are going to have schools and pilgrimage places, health centres. And people will think that's it. That's not it at all.

Anything you read that Mother said, all that is just to keep us busy. We have to come on a different level. We have to be on a different level. If you look at some of the young people, it's just like that. They're not going to read a book or go to school. They live so much.

There is something that Mother told me. It's a bit tough. She told me this in a house in Ashley Gardens. She said, "Those who build the stage are not those who climb on it." And I was there and I was thinking, "Hey, wait a minute. Where am I in that?" She also said to us that you put the rubble in the foundation. It's a similar thing. Not the rubbish, though.

She got angry with you, I remember, in Kathmandu, when you said something to the effect of, "Mother, does that mean we'll just be forgotten about, buried in mud underneath everyone else?" She said, "No, no, that is the most important." Because you need to be solid to be a founding stone. It means we are not those who are going to manifest ourselves.

Look at the artists of our generation. I'm not going to take names, but in our generation, there were some yogis who were musicians, right? None of them, bless their souls, but none of them managed to be the Mozarts and the Vivaldis of the new age. While now, when you look at the yogis, there is so much talent and it's really bubbly.

I really enjoyed the music festival we had at the farm in England recently. I thought the talent was amazing, some of the younger ones. Incredible. I was quite surprised. Because when it first started, I remember walking into a big public program we had at the Hammersmith Town Hall, and there was this so-called Sahaj group on the stage. They were singing this song and I kind of went, "Oh my God, this is just horrendous." But it's changed so much. There's some real talent there. I was incredibly impressed.

Another similarity that I had with Pat is being embarrassed when we were facing the public in Caxton Hall. We were always anticipating what they may think of us, and we needed to go over that. I can remember the feeling. I just felt inadequate. Not a good example in any way. I was half dead. But she used that, we didn't understand, but for energetic purposes. Shopping with her in Oxford Street was an agony. I was in the shop looking for the next chair all the time because I was so tired. Shopping with her—not an agony, of course we enjoyed it with Shri Mataji—but it was exhausting. Because being with her and being in Oxford Street, so much stuff was going through us.

Most of it was hard work, I found. Of course, you enjoy being with her, but it was very hard work. It was such a blessing, but it was really like a marine training. It was like the night of taking vibrations. Half my mind would be, "This is amazing." The other half, "Just wake up and tell me I can go to sleep now." And then when Mother did, I thought, "No, I don't want to." That struggle to physically keep yourself going. Or even just rubbing Mother's feet, taking the vibrations. It would go on and on and on sometimes, and your arms are just on fire. You just want to stop, you can't keep going. And yet, it's such an amazing thing, and she wants you to keep going, so you have to. It was all quite tough in many ways. It was unrelenting.

I always remember when Mother first moved from Oxted Green, she moved to that place by Sloane Square. That flat. And while we were there, she had a load of furniture, and we all had to move it. There were tons and tons of it. At a certain stage, as we were all really, really knackered, she said, "Oh, you're all rather tired, but the vibrations are flowing really well." And I remember thinking then, "Uh-oh."

So, when you met Mother originally, what was it that convinced you that she was who she was?
This is the reason why I had the guts to write The Advent. At some point, Shri Mataji showed me chapters of the book, which is now going to be published for yogis, which is what we call the Opus Magnum of Shri Mataji. The beginning is the story of the creation. I found this, of course, mind-blowing, but I thought, "Shri Mataji, Mother, this is fantastic, but it's going to fly above the heads of the people. I think someone should write a little introduction." And she asked me, "Would you like to do it?" I said, "Well, me, Mother? You want me to do it?" So I said, "Okay, I'll write the introduction," and that became The Advent.

But the reason I had the guts to write it is because of what I'm now telling you. I don't think I remember 20% of what happened to me. Sometimes I was saying, "Gee, this is so important. I should remember. I should write it down." And we never did it.

I think the second time when I visited, I had come back from Switzerland. And I was in the little salon, you remember the salon up there? There was this statue of Ganesha in wood we had at the ashram. At some point, she asked me, because I felt that one of the reasons I thought I was finished was because of the Mooladhara Chakra. So, at some point, I was laying on my tummy before a statue of Shri Ganesha. And she asked me, "Ask forgiveness to Shri Ganesha." So I was laying like this before the statue and I was asking, "Please, Shri Ganesha, forgive me." And then I felt cool vibrations coming from the statue. And I tell you, this was something.

In that same room, I was going to leave. And I felt I'm not going to maintain this. Because as he described in his book, when you are with her, you feel so comfortable, the comfort of the spirit. You feel so within the territory of love. But then when you leave, it's another matter. So, I felt I'm not going to manage that.

She was sitting like you and me. And then she said, "You shouldn't be sad." Because I was feeling sad, but I was not telling her. She just said to me, "You shouldn't feel sad." And she did something like that with her hand. And then... the complete, total... When we feel vibration, it's in the gaseous state. According to the sixth chapter of the Jnaneshwari. But then when that raises to a power, it's like a cloud becoming condensated into water. So, it was a liquid. It was not gaseous; it was a liquid coming into the entire cells of the body. And it was a complete amrut.

You know, human beings imagine that the highest intensity of sensation they can experience is sex. But that was more than that. And in the entire body. And it was sacred. Because it was spiritual, but it was also physical. So, it was both sacred and physical. And I felt this thing. And that's when I knew. A saint cannot do that. A prophet cannot do that. So that's when I said, "Gee, this is something else." It went away after some time, and I never had such a powerful experience afterwards. Never, ever. And yet, afterwards, I hope I was better than what I was then. This was a compassion. She gave us those experiences because she probably thought that we needed to comfort our own confidence. Otherwise, we would just be washed away. It's just out of compassion she gave us these things.

I was just thinking that was the same room where I had my experience where she actually became the Virgin Mary. In my garden in Kathmandu, I have a picture. I don't know whether it was when you were there or not, but at some point, she was sitting in the corner of the garden on a little chair. And I asked Shri Mataji, "How did the Virgin Mary wear her veil?" Because she's always represented with something. And then she took her sari and put it on. That was very moving.

About this house where you were. You know Liz Lotter, this lady who had an Old Vienna restaurant in Kathmandu? A lot of Germans and Austrians came to Sahaja Yoga thanks to her. One day, she moved into a house, and then the landlady living next door comes into her house and she sees the picture of Shri Mataji. And Liz Lotter said, "What? What do you mean?" She said, "Yes, yes. A couple of years ago, there was a young man working for the United Nations, and this lady came and visited him." Liz Lotter, without knowing it, in the entire Kathmandu, had rented the house where I had received Shri Mataji. Just in Nakpokari, behind the old palace. They say the devil is in the details, but for us, God is in the details.

One or two months ago, I was in Portugal, and I walked into the hall of the Tivoli Hotel where Shri Mataji went after the marriage of Arnaud. And I just saw the hall and I started crying just in the middle of it. It was the same hall in which we sat with Shri Mataji in August '80, when Arnaud and Maria got married. Because of the marriage ceremony, they organized the first programs in Portugal. It was just a flashback.

There was something also very moving which happened in Portugal, and that was in Sintra. Because the marriage was in Sintra, at the Hotel de Seteais. We were in a little restaurant, and there was some round bread. And then Shri Mataji explained the communion. She said, "Christ was just Pranava. So what he did, he took the bread and he put the vibration in the bread to vibrate the apostles." And then she took the bread and gave it to everybody.

We used to go to Oxted Green, which is where Shri Mataji lived at the time. When Sir CP moved to London, he found that location. She stayed quite a few years there, and that is the period where you can see Sahaja Yoga started in England. Going towards this house were all those who started taking an interest in her and in what she had to say. In a sense, it's quite special. After, when she moved to London, to various locations such as Ashley Gardens and Brompton Square—Ashley Gardens was, of course, where she stayed just above the Westminster Cathedral, by the way—at that time you could say Sahaja Yoga had started. But when she was in Oxted Green, that is when it started. That was really the moment. That's why we go down, just as a pilgrimage, paying our homage by taking the train again, even if the color of the train has changed.

On the back of her seat, we had put a batik representing Shri Kalki, that is Vishnu on a white horse. And on that evening, she said, "Today is the beginning of Satya Yuga." That happened in Caxton Hall. "That which starts in England goes around the world." It has. It's taken a bit longer than I expected. But the thing is, you can only take one step at a time.

There are moments which happen in England which impact the world and are actually quite sweet. I remember when I was in the Rome Embassy, the marriage of Charles and Diana. At that time, Diana was realized. And you remember how we felt? I was in Rome watching that, and the entire world was watching that. Now, when Diana had her accident, despite everything about their lives, there was such an empathy in the entire world that you had a true moment of collective consciousness. It was amazing.

And much closer to us, it's the wedding of William and Kate. Because I tell you, when they went out with the cavalcade and Lifeguards in the back, the sun came out. You could really feel the blessings. And when they sang "Jerusalem" in Westminster... we were watching this at home on the television and Kat said, "I wish they would sing Jerusalem." And three seconds later, the first notes. So, there is still the attention, the blessings. And Mother did say that William is born realized.

When Diana died, it was unbelievable. They lined not just the streets, the roads. And it rained all day. But even when it immediately happened, people just went to London and they were just walking about in the park, opening up to each other. And these psychologists tried to dismiss it as some sort of... they were just standing in the park with their hands open. You see, that, I think, is when you feel the power of the heart. The power which is stored at the subtle level in the tattwa of this country. So, it shoots through in these moments.

My two sisters and my cousin, who are all aged about 60, slept on the pavement the night before to get a good place to watch and to wave them on. Many people did that. They thought it was an amazing experience. I think because they wanted the collective experience, which was very strong. It's an identity thing. The royal family captures some of the identity of the people, and they would like this identity to be something that they can enjoy. And it has not always been the case with the Windsors. So, when they see auspiciousness, they want to be part of it. It's brilliant.

Shri Mataji, you hear a lot of cassettes where she gives a talking-to to the English. But in that sense, we say in Latin, qui bene amat, bene castigat—who loves well, chastises well. For instance, I counted in my miserable life at least five major scoldings from Shri Mataji, and I have missed the small ones. And actually, when I look at some people who never were corrected by Shri Mataji... She told me once, "Go and tell Guido," she wanted me to tell off Guido. "Go and tell Guido because I cannot tell him myself." So, in a sense, it means that she cared about England, that she loved the English, and that's why she was so much harder on them. It's a bit like the older children have to take the responsibility. Pat and Maureen, they had the core training. Boy, did we get it. At Cabella, we worked there for months, seven days a week, and got blasted one day to the next.

One day, we were coming back from Ratnagiri on the boat. And then Shri Mataji was whisked away in a car with Rajesh. I was, of course, very jealous. I ended up in another car with Paul Winter and Bala Kanagasabai. And these are two remarkable characters. Paul and Bala started fighting, and Paul had rented the car. I was trying to make peace between two strong personalities. We arrived, the three of us, before Shri Mataji, completely caught up. And Shri Mataji started scolding me. I walk away. Then Rajesh asked Shri Mataji, "Mother, why did you scold Grégoire? Because it's the two others." And Shri Mataji told him, "Because Grégoire was the only one who could take it." Dubious privilege. But the next morning, she gave me a little statue of Shri Kartikeya, which I don't know what it means, but I still have it on my altar.

There's a difference between the training and the knowledge. Everybody can have the knowledge. But the training is different. And some people got the training. And that's why it's important to communicate. That's also what you try to do with your book. And I was really admiring how you did it, because you did it well. It was really well written, with a little bit of humor, which needs to be there.

When I finished it, I really thought, "How the hell did I do that?" It wasn't easy. It was just pushing on and on and on. But I'm pleasantly surprised at the way it turned out. I hope it does some good.

What I find difficult is to write about this stage of consciousness. How would you describe your best stage of consciousness? Elevated, that's all I can say. It's hard to describe. It's very difficult to describe to anybody else because people don't understand vibrations. But I think with a lot of the things that we've been through, it's just instinctive. You know what's right and wrong. Vibrations are also in the intuition, the common sense, in the being. And that's why I find it a little bit surprising that some people are now inventing new methodologies that never existed with Shri Mataji. Little envelopes and this and that. And when you look at the results, they came up with some wrong results. Because vibrations are not a GPS. You cannot put it in a little box. Vibration is also your consciousness.

It's a bit like the pujas. Mother started with a certain thing and changed it and changed it and changed it. Some people got stuck at certain points. And, for instance, in England, for ten years, we had a style that was rigid. It was like church. That was the time of our friend in Cambridge. And at the time, Mother was... you blink and you miss the puja. She got it to that level, whereas we were still following rules. He'd stop it in the middle and make us start again. Unbelievable.

But this is ritualism. And ritualism in a religion is an expression of diffidence. If you have trust in your heart and confidence in your relationship with God, then you use protocol as an expression of respect that comes from the heart. But if you are afraid of losing your connection with the divine, and that fear is too big, then we try to secure the access through rituals. This is the entire history of religion. Buddhism was killed by ritualism. And we see all this coming back into Sahaja Yoga. That's why the training is important. Because the knowledge itself is not enough. If you would like to help a yogi and say, "Mother said this," that yogi will unearth something else and send you the counter-quote. So you need from inside to understand. And that's what the training was for.

How would you give that training to someone now who's new to Sahaja Yoga? If you train, you need to be prepared for tough love. Because the yogis have a comfort level in love, and from there, they slide easily into a place where everybody is nice, it's all love, it's fine. And with that, you don't deliver the ascent. Because there is negativity, and we need to be able to stand by what is right. That's the Vishnu aspect. So in Austria, I was explaining that. If you want to train someone, first of all, your hand is full of love. So you hold him with love here, and then you can do that. Because if he knows I love him, if at some point I tell him something which is a bit tough, because he knows I love him, he will take it. It's basic. Maybe the only way you have this balance between caring about people but also needing to be clear.

The younger ones, the newer ones, have to have the right balance between self-reliance and humility to listen. That's the problem in a lot of them. They're going off into ego. It's just extraordinary. Now they're arguing about whether the candle should be on the left of the altar or the right. You are right, because a piece of advice is only as good as the one who receives it.

I feel frustrated by the way some people who you think you'd be able to rely on are going off on some sidetrack and making it more difficult to deal with the more serious problems.

There are two stories I wanted to tell as we are on the train. The first story, you all know it, but it's quite topical. Mother was telling how she was in a train like this, and she saw young kids who were slashing the seats. People were afraid, and she confronted them. She said, "Why are you doing that?" And they said, "We are very angry." And she said all she could feel was the center heart was catching. So it was basically related to security at heart. When she arrived, she denounced it at the station, and the guy said, "This is a very common thing, we don't know what to do." Now, this is about 30 years ago. So you can see that what has been going on in London over the last week is something which has germinated for so long. It has to do with parenting, with loss of values. It's not just a law and order issue.

The other story I wanted to tell you about the train is when I was on my way to one of our meetings at Gavin's place. I went down with Shri Mataji, and she was sitting actually here, going towards London, and I was sitting with Pat in front of her. At some point, I asked, "Shri Mataji, who are you?" And then she said, "Ask the vibrations." So I closed my eyes and I put my hands together and waited for some time. And then I opened my eyes, and she was looking at me in her own sort of Mona Lisa-plus style. And she said, "So?" And I said, a bit disappointed, "Nothing, Shri Mataji. There is only the silence." I wanted something a bit more. "Nothing, Shri Mataji. There is only the silence." And then she told me, "That's it. I am the silence."

After that, when I walked in Victoria Station, I had an experience where I felt that I was walking on a cushion of air. My feet felt like I was walking without them touching the ground. And that was on our way to a meeting at Gavin's place. So that happened on the train here.

The way we got to know you, mostly, for the next two years, was through your letters, because you used to write to Shri Mataji every other day, didn't you? And she used to read some of the bits out to us. Oh, really? I didn't know. So we felt you were there with us. And I was living for her letters. Kathmandu was quite funny. At some point, Mother came back. I was sitting in my office, and an Indian gentleman comes and says, "I'm looking for Mr. de Kalbermatten." And I said, "Yes, I am." I thought he was some guy from the office, whatever, so I was not particularly courteous. And he said, "I'm Rommel Varma." And I said, "Yes, so?" And he says, "I'm the son-in-law of Shri Mataji." Then I jumped one meter. "What?" And then he said, "Yes, and she's here." I didn't know she was coming. "What do you mean she's here?" "She's in a taxi."

So I rush out of my office, and there was a place in the middle of the U.N. compound where all the drivers were staying. And Mother was sitting on the back of this little Toyota taxi. So I kneeled on the ground in the middle of the compound and I put my head in the car on her feet. You can imagine the U.N. drivers, "What's going on?"

During that trip, she came twice. And it was really nice because she cooked for me. All my electric appliances were not working, so she cooked on the fire. And also once, she asked me, "Grégoire, where are the legs of the chicken?" And I said, "The legs of the chicken, Shri Mataji?" In India, they do things in a weird way, and I never had any meat on my chickens. I had only bones. And I thought that's the way they do it here. She said, "Grégoire, you are so naive. For all this time, your cook has been bringing the best pieces of chicken to his family, and you are just eating the bones." She knew it, and I didn't know, of course. I was so furious, I fired the cook the next day. I had not noticed that the chicken had no legs.

You were there when we were doing the Ajwain all together? We've got photographs. Some people do Ajwain at meetings and go away. And you know how Shri Mataji said, "You should cover your head and never go out." And they go out. No, you'd get a really good dose. And we were actually under there with her.

And going out to that picnic where we went to visit the boys' school... Yes, I put that in the book. You put that in the book, but there is a little episode. Because Shri Mataji told me after that, "You have to start Sahaja Yoga with them." And I mean, this was a bunch of kids, 10, 12 years old. So I invited the boys to my home. And you know what? They stole my wallet. I said, "That's it." Sahaja Yoga started eventually, but after me. Liz Lotter did a lot of work.

The interesting thing about Kathmandu is that that's where we saw lots of hippies. We were all terrified. Because we had so recently come from that. My wife actually laughed a lot about that. He put it in his book also, because there were some hippies and she wanted to look for you to work on the hippies, and she turned around, terrified, and you had run away because the last thing you wanted was to see them. That was in India itself, in Maharashtra.

I remember this guy, I think he was called David, playing guitar. He was a hippie. At some point he tore the picture of Shri Mataji. He was actually in quite a bad shape. Then I took him down the staircase. I remember. I took him down the staircase and then his mattress after him. He went completely mad. I was in that top room, and I heard this pounding up the stairs. And he burst into the room doing funny leaps like this. And then there was a pounding up the stairs after him, and you burst in there and said, "Where is he? I'll kill him." He had torn a picture of Shri Mataji in front of me.

One of his problems was he couldn't stop being a reporter. He wanted to investigate Sahaja Yoga. He was too inquisitive to just accept. The irony was that when he got his realization, he had an incredibly powerful experience. In fact, he rang the ashram after three days and said, "How long does this last? Because I can't do much work with it."

Sometimes I think each of us had the feeling at some point she brought us to such a high point, and then we had the feeling, "No, not now." We can't stay there now. We need to come down because there is work to do. Otherwise, when you are there, that's it. That's why they say the Bodhisattva is somebody who is there, and then he comes down because of compassion. We were not there because it's our level; we were there because she showed it to us. She actually said once to us that it was not that difficult to achieve these higher states, but that she had actually caused it to be put on hold because she needed the work.

Today, I think that it's very important to help. And I think that all of you can be helpful by telling the yogis that we are in Sahaja Yoga for Sat-Chit-Ananda. That's what we are in Sahaja Yoga for. And then if we do other things like schools or other projects, fine, no problem. But let's keep the perspective. Otherwise, we are going to end up in a couple of years building some sort of religion. Administrators. And this is the temptation which is now put on us.

This Catholic thing has been a complete... 2,000 years. How can you beat that? It's the most successful religious institution which ever existed. 2,000 years of being a state represented at the United Nations, and a complete fallacy. Because spiritually, it's a complete fallacy. And now it's ending up with priests hopping on little boys and other disgusting stuff.

So, I think when we have all this historical experience, Mother put us in a homeopathic situation where we are being given a bit of the poison, a bit of the temptation to organize, to administer. And we need to handle that from a spiritual point of view. If you run away and you do nothing and you play guitar and you meditate alone, it's not enough either. It's the balance which we need to achieve.

One of the hardest things about Sahaja Yoga has been the mediocrity of a lot of the people that you come up against. The difficulty in communicating. We feel so frustrated. The reason I wrote that book was that when we moved down to Essex, we were doing local meetings in the town. And in 10 years, we didn't establish one person. I remember thinking, if we could have just got one a year, it would have been worth it. That's our lot. That's the founding story.

If we say this and people hear you saying that, they may think we are arrogant because we speak about mediocrity. But there was a speech of Shri Mataji in Italy where she said 50% of the yogis are mediocre, 25% are idiots, and the rest I don't know. Now, I pull my ears, but I didn't say that. It means that it's not a picnic. People need to invest. You need to invest in Sahaja Yoga. You cannot just be a consumer of Sahaja Yoga. And that responsibility, as you say, that's a problem you have in the UK. People would be very happy to enjoy and consume Sahaja Yoga, but you need to generate it also.

We've had three of these retreats, we call them. Because the problem is, trying to get them from the little meeting, or even the big meeting, to the puja, the leap is just too big. So we said, "Come to this retreat." And during the day, by the end of the eight hours, everything had reached a new level. It was like Mother took you, she talked to you, she fed you, she cooked for you. So we did things all day. It wasn't just lectures. It was vibrations, foot-soaking, everything. And at the end of the day, they were fine. It worked very well, actually.

When we were in the USA, we had so-called seminars, which is the same thing. And then it was a full weekend, because it's nice to spend the night. But we didn't know, because the American Sahaja Yogis, like all Sahaja Yogis in the world, are more or less broke. So we were looking for the cheaper places. And after a certain number of seminars, we realized that all the cheaper places where we went were the places where the mentally retarded used to have their summer gatherings. So we had the most amazing nightmares during the night. So we went on clearing these places where you had the really heavy-duty people. But still, it did work.

For me, England is part of the magic. It's fine to go to Cabella, but I think we should also allow pujas in Cabella in the summer, but maybe we should also return to what happened when Shri Mataji was traveling and have one puja in the UK, one in the Americas. We need a puja in the UK next year, definitely.

Mother always used to make us do things together. Whatever it is, it's not important. But doing things together was important.

Isn't it our destination to be in that high state all the time? How high can we go before we become ineffective?
For me, the way I view things is that for Shri Mataji, Sahaja Yoga was an experiment. And that she actually didn't know exactly the way it would happen. Why? Because in the entire universe, man is the random factor because of freedom. She knows how the animals, how the stones, how the planets, how the angels are going to behave. But she can't exactly know how human beings are going to behave because of freedom. And that's the entire interest of God for man. That's the play. That's the lila.

A guy had a dream, an amazing vision in Vashi, after being very sick. The idea is that in 2012, there would be something metabolic happening and that we would stop catching so much. Because just now, what happens is, as soon as we're a little bit better, we clear ourselves after puja, and then, bam, we catch again. We function like washing machines all the time. With this, we can't really go high. Because as soon as we take a little altitude, boom, we are again caught up. And that has been happening for the last 30 years.

But if that process of catching gets removed, then we will start stabilizing into our real nature. And then you will have a parting of the way. Because in Satya Yuga, on one hand, you have the gods who look good, and you have the demons who look ugly. Now, it's the contrary. People who look good are demonic, and people who are on the good side are rather lost. So, you are going to have a parting of the way where evil people are going to be clearly evil, and good people are going to be clearly good. In the Apocalypse of John, between the manifestation of Shri Kalki and Armageddon, there is 1,000 years. So, it's fantasizing. But if now is the manifestation, maybe it's the start of the manifestation of Shri Kalki, of which nobody knows anything, including me.

In my line of business, which is environment, you can see already how, if we start speaking about climate change... there is a book which has just come out in the USA from an environmentalist who is saying that the human population is going to come down to 500 million. We know that there is a conflict between population growth and natural resources. It is serious.

But to cope with these high states, it has to happen gradually. You have to build up capacity to deal with it.

How long since you've been here, Gregoire? Here? 35 years, at least. Since '75, do the math.

There was a guy who Shri Mataji was giving instructions to come to Oxted Green. We were just listening to the telephone. And she was saying, "No, come to Oxted Green. No, Oxted Green. Earth Green, not Earth Blue. Earth Green." So we were already rolling with laughter on the carpet, because Mother herself was cracking up. She asked, "The leaves, what is the color of the leaves?" And then we hear Mother saying, "No, the color of the leaves is not blue." Sometimes we were just laughing.

When Sahaja Yoga was such a small group, I think he got a level of proximity which was quite enjoyable. And I think what you enjoy, first of all, is that incredible comfort of love that emanates from her. And from there on, you can accept, because it's experience-based. It's not that you accept that Shri Mataji is the Maha Avatar because that's mental. But you have such an empathy that it flows into you that, yes, she is carrying this incredible power of love. It's actually not so difficult when you have the experience. For everybody else, it's impossible. Recognition of Mother is only experience-based.

In this house, when Mother was in this house, you can say Sahaja Yoga started in the world. Because before, it was only in India. And she started Sahaja Yoga in the world being in this house. That's the story. All the next houses or flats, it had picked up already. But this is where it started. I would be inclined to say that it really started to take root in London. This is where it began. When we went to Gavin's house, it then started to grow. But as it got bigger, it moved further and further. Then you had Caxton Hall. That was the first public meeting, and then it entered a different sort of phase. This was a period of something completely private. It wasn't a movement. It was a bunch of lost people huddling together around her. That was that.

It just felt like a palace with Mother in it. Completely. It was like stepping into another world. We spent a long time, really, in another world. And the light inside was golden. There was a statue of Shri Krishna, small. And a Shiva on the mantelpiece. And Kartikeya in stone. She had all the deities around. She turned what's basically an ordinary house into something completely... This back garden was where she washed our feet. Remember that picture? It was such a difficult moment. Such an awe-inspiring moment, but so difficult.

I had a moment. This is actually quite private; I never told this story to anyone. I had come for the first time, and at some point, I was resting in a bedroom. And we were just resting in our underpants. And then she came in the room, and I was very, very shy because I wasn't dressed. But I felt like the story where the mother of Duryodhana looks at her son and protects him because of the power of her glance. I felt like her glance was completely refreshing and granting me innocence again. I was really treated like a child immediately. Right there.

That little bit sticking out was CP's little den, his little office. It is exactly as it was. But all these trees have grown up much more. That's why I didn't recognize it, because you couldn't see the house. But at that time, you could see the house from down there.

The salon upstairs is where we had the workout, where she was working on us, having us sit at her feet and putting coconut oil and massaging our heads. At some point, I had a little puja. She asked me to do a little puja for her, and she was standing in the thali with the water. And then I asked her, "Mother, can I drink the water?" And she said, "Yes." So I was like this before her, drinking the water.

We had the first Havans we had here, didn't we? During the night. In the back. Mother sat cross-legged on the ground. We read a thousand names. I can't remember. Mother was raging because none of us could understand Sanskrit.

We were so completely clueless. I think that was our protection. Absolutely. Otherwise, we... We didn't know until we went to India. We had no idea about protocol.

You remember once there was some sort of hippie who organized a program for Shri Mataji. We had to take a train. It was quite far. It was a big room, and there were only five or six people in there. I saw the hall was empty. I told Shri Mataji, "Mother, please go back to London. I'll give the program," because I felt so embarrassed to have asked her to come all the way. And she said, "No, I will give the program." And from that on, whenever there is nobody coming to a program of Sahaja Yoga, I say, "Okay, if she's the Adi Shakti and she has five people, even if I have one cat, I should be blessed."

I was really amazed at how many people came to Caxton Hall the first time. It filled up. It was amazing. And at the end, we had the Royal Albert Hall full. And what I find pretty telling is that after a Royal Albert Hall program, you guys organized a huge follow-up in Holland Park. And there, Shri Mataji said, "Please take Sahaja Yoga seriously because very little time is left." And when she says that, I say, "Wait a minute, time goes on forever. What does she mean?" So there is an eschatological dimension that there is a deadline. There is a deadline.

It started with the Twin Towers. Definitely. Because I had a dream a month or so before in which I could see these big spikes over the horizon coming up slowly. In the end, it got to above the horizon. It was the crown of Shri Kalki slowly appearing. And when I saw the Twin Towers with the shards of the building stuck like that, I got that feeling of déjà vu from that dream. And I felt that that's what it was. It can't go on. The Twin Towers was the beginning of something. The number 11. The Ekadasha Rudra, the 11 destructive powers of Shri Shiva.

Long, long time back in Zurich, I asked Shri Mataji, "Mother, what about the incarnation of Shri Kalki? Is he just going to be a collective principle? Or is he going to be a physical incarnation like you?" You know what she answered? She answered, "That has not been decided yet."

So, what do you feel Shri Kalki is now? I had one or two insights in the Finchley ashram. One insight I had in the flat of David Spiro in Hampstead. I asked Mother... I said, "So, the whole apocalypse is Catholicism?" Which is what Martin Luther said. And she looked at me and she said, "Aha," like, "Okay, you got it." So, that was a big thing. And then the other intuition... with my back against the wall in the meditation room of the Finchley ashram, I said, "But then, Shri Mataji must be the Holy Spirit." Because never had anyone mentioned that before, this connection. Now, for you, it's a given fact that Adi Shakti means Holy Spirit. At that time, nobody had. And then, when I thought that, I felt the vibrations really sort of... and then I asked her. It was nice; you could go and ask, you could check.

And the third one, which I still don't quite understand, and that's to answer your question, is because I wondered what is the relationship between us and Shri Kalki. Because she's giving birth to us, but Shri Kalki is the incarnation. So, what does it mean? And then I came up with this notion that the host of Shri Kalki is the collective consciousness of the yogis. And then, again, I brought this to her as a hypothesis. And that's the only thing about The Advent—because she went through every single page, what is there is correct. This happened all when we were together in Finchley. And this is why no one should try to control the host. This is why there cannot be individual leadership in Sahaja Yoga.

The collective, it's not democracy. It's not a mob getting together and saying, "We don't agree." It's a consciousness. To get there, it's not all the email nonsense going on and rumors and gossips. It's good we interact through social networks just to keep in sync, but there is a limit to what we achieve by that, because it becomes mental very easily. But if we all do what she asked us to do—to go inside—then we activate the host, because it's a consciousness. The ego has to dissolve completely for it to manifest. For us to be perfect instruments. Ego and superego, both. To be a perfect instrument, you must be completely surrendered.

Mother used leadership, and leadership will always exist. Because it's an articulation of... if you have a collectivity, you need to articulate it. This is anthropology. You take any human community, you need people with their roles. There will always be a relationship between the priest and the king, because they have always tended to combine to rule the others. But as we become Homo spiritualis, as we become spiritual beings, we should go beyond that.

There will always be leadership in communities, because otherwise, Mother said, "I use leaders, because otherwise, all your egos would go up." And also, this fashion that everybody is now a leader... no, everybody is your own guru. It's not the same as everybody is a leader, because then you have anarchy, and nothing is done. You enjoy the play. You can enjoy someone else being the leader. You enjoy the fact that it's not on your shoulders. You don't have any interest in being a leader. It's a function, not a status. And when you are in that position of a leader, you don't get an ego about it. You are to be the enabler and the facilitator.

Mother made me the first so-called world leader, and it sounded like a joke. She called me on the podium at the Guru Puja in Andorra and she asked me to sit before her. And everybody saw me and laughed. Because why do you need a world leader if Mother is there? Obviously.

But when I thought about it, because I am quite careful in my own understanding, because of the training that I got, I'm quite careful to get this thing right and to be committed to the fact that what Shri Mataji wants after her departure is collective leadership. This is my own understanding of Sahaja Yoga. She wants collective leadership because she said one day that the bit in the Bible where Jesus said to St. Peter, "You are Peter, and on this stone I will build my church," she said, "This is a fallacy." She said it in Migliano. "How could Christ have done such a mistake? How could Christ have given all the powers to a single person? I would never do such a mistake." She said it. So when she said it, I said, "Good, now it's clear." I know that it is spiritually blessed by Shri Mataji. It is possible for realized souls.

I think that why Mother put me on this little pink cloud is that if I have this understanding and I'm on the pink cloud, at least I am an obstacle for other people who would not have this understanding and would like to be on the pink cloud. The Central Committee now, I think we all have the same understanding. We don't see ourselves as leaders. We see ourselves more as mentors.

Until we get there, human society is articulated through these sorts of things. You look in England, you look at Bristol... where negativity attacks a collectivity is in this relationship between the few who want to do things and so, quote, "take leadership," and the others who start resisting. And until we get this smoothly, it means maturing on all sides. The people on the right side need to cool down, and the people on the left side need to wake up. It's the Agnya again. Fight and surrender. It'll be fine.

It somehow feels as if a lot of time has gone very quickly. For me, it's completely unreal.

Recent, the last great puja with Shri Mataji was the Adi Shakti puja. There is one guy from the UK who was supposed to bring The Devi Mahatmyam books. The only chance to sell the books in the UK was at the puja. I saw the books for sale and The Devi Mahatmyam wasn't there. So I asked, "Why aren't the books there?" And someone said, "Well, the car of the guy who was supposed to bring the book broke down." So I sat quite dejected because I said, "Mother, I can write the book, but if the car breaks down..." I was really sulking.

Then a girl, an English yogini, came from the back. She had the sun behind her, so she had the sun through her hair. She asked if I had been to the exhibition of William Blake. And I said no. And she said, "Okay, come and see it." So I go in the exhibition of William Blake and then I see the story of Job. And then I was so moved, because I was thinking, "Now here is the one who threw Satan into hell, the commander-in-chief of the angelic hosts, who wrote on his diary the word 'despair,' and who couldn't buy soap because he was so broke. And everybody thought he was mad." And I said, "My God." And Kartikeya locked himself in a cave... I mean, that was Jnaneshwar, who was the incarnation of Kartikeya. So when you see what they went through, and Grégoire sits and is pissed off because the car broke down, it really put things in perspective.

We've had it easy, really. Sometimes we feel it was a bit tough because some of us had a bumpy road. But if you look at things in perspective, we had it very easy. We had a bumpy road because of our own faults. If we could have let it all go in an instant, we'd have had a smooth road. Maybe, but we were working out karma, individual and collective. I had my own karma. I have a karma of an arrogant race I have to deal with. It exists.

Once, it was really up and down for me, like a yo-yo, which is an expression that Shri Mataji used for me. It was bumpy sometimes. And so at some point I said, "Shri Mataji, I feel like a doggy out in the rain." And she said, "Yes, but there is always an umbrella following you." So, it's very cute and basically, we take things too seriously. It was not being able to communicate with the seekers easily. That was the toughest thing. Just having all that knowledge and all these people who just didn't get it or wouldn't get it. Very frustrating, I found.

But now the quality of the seekers is incredible. It's got lighter and it's a lot easier and people experience more. It's just whatever we're doing, we don't see what the effect is. I used to feel like I had a mountain on my head. It just used to be unbearable. We're finding people come now and say, "Ah, I saw her 10 years ago." So it's been laid down and we just have to keep going. And relax, I think.

In 1980 when I came, we went to the Mind Body Spirit exhibition just to have a look. Then we went to see Mother after this. She had to work on everyone because we just couldn't take it. We were completely finished. So the level of our vibrations has increased. Oh, she banned us from going for a while because we got too caught up. The level of our vibrations has increased so much. We go to them now and we are in charge. We can be there all weekend and feel incredible. We did this at an alternative health fair in Lausanne, and for me, Switzerland is the pits. Anyway, that was in Lausanne and the vibrations were very strong. So something is moving and something is happening. It was strong there where we had our stand. And all around, it's such muck. But it used to be the reverse. The muck was up here and we were down like this. And now we're up here and they're down there. You have a point. They're all coming to our stall to get their realizations, exhausted and finished. So it's very good.
