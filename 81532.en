Oh, sorry. Yes, please.

The year that Douglas turned 75, he came to us in Bulgaria for a holiday. During that time, we went on a seminar with the whole Bulgarian collective to the Black Sea, and we stayed there for about four or five days. Knowing that his birthday would be in November, I went around to all the people in the collective to ask them to say something they felt about Douglas, and I recorded it.

There's a picture of me taking it, and I think a couple are singing "Happy Birthday" to him in English with a strong Bulgarian accent, and he's walking behind them to go to the car. He didn't realize what was going on at all. It's really funny when you play it back and you see them singing "Happy Birthday" while he's walking along behind them.

"Can you post all this? You cannot. How can you post this video?"

"She's going to do it next time, Grishna."

"I'm going to do it next time. Okay."

There are lots of testimonials from English Sahaja Yogis as well. I've got the one that Mark told about when he and Douglas tested whether someone could be woken up by their own snoring.

"Actually, it was me who said that."

"It sounded like Mark."

"No, it was me."

"Okay."

The nicest thing to mention is that if anyone, anywhere in the world is wondering anything about him, when they put their attention on him, they feel better. That's the main thing. Because people will say, "Who is he?" or whatever, but when they put their attention on him, they feel better. So then, that's the answer.

Thank you.
