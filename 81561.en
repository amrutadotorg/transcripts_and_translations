 (England)
Thank you so much for joining this evening. Kay O'Connell, you've been in our panel of Golden Memories way back when we started, and thank you for organising this session. We're very pleased to have Kingsley, Jeremy and Phil with us. And it is what was the collective in Brighton, I presume. Would you start by telling us when it was that Sahaja Yoga started and how in Brighton, please?

That would be 1979, I suppose. Would everyone agree with that? You were there before me, Kingsley. Towards I suppose around October. I had a very strange girlfriend, and once she went up to London and I didn't see her for some weeks. Then she came back at the weekend and said, "I've met this group of people who are going around in a van giving self-realisation." And I said, "Oh, really?" I had sworn I would never have a guru because Brighton had all kinds of gurus there, and I knew a chap who got involved with TM and just went grey and shrivelled up, basically. It was horrible. So I swore, never a guru.

I said, "Well, what's it about?" And she said, "Well, it's this lady who's a guru and she's also a mother." And I thought, "Well, that's nice." So then, very shortly after that, which would have been late summer, I went up to London with a girlfriend of a friend and we went to Caxton Hall.

Amazing. And how was that? Is that the first time you saw Shri Mataji?

Yeah. We went up there. We were a bit late coming from the train in Brighton. We went into Caxton Hall and there were all these shoes outside. And I thought, "Oh, this is a serious affair then." I mean, it's politeness anywhere to take your shoes off, but certainly if you're going to meet a guru, it's common sense. I was always a seeker. It just made sense.

So we went through this door and there was a medium-sized room, and right up one end was a tiny Indian lady in a huge wooden chair. The room was virtually full. She saw us coming in and she said, "Oh, come in, come in. There's room at the front." Right at the front. So there we were, just right in a seat. And she proceeded to talk about all kinds of things that were very interesting, including drugs and what have you, with which I'd been quite happily involved for the previous nine years. That was how I met Shri Mataji. And then later on, of course, we were all introduced to her by the people who were there from London. She worked on us and asked our names and put her foot on my back.

What's the most remarkable thing that's imprinted on you from that day with Shri Mataji?

Well, it just seemed the most natural thing. If I were honest with you, I'd been a very passionate seeker. I was curious about everything from the age of being a toddler and went through passionate Christianity, years of happy hippiedom, the I Ching, Egyptology, astrology, all that business, and lots and lots of hashish. And when the time came, it was the most natural thing of all. It was a natural progression to meet the right person at the right time. It was wonderful. It makes complete sense. It wasn't one of those sort of electric light bulb moments people often have.

Also, not only that, but when my girlfriend first worked on me before I went to London, it felt kind of familiar because I'd already worked out that if you weren't true to yourself, your spirit would be to the left or to the right of your body. Somehow it was a weird concept, so it made complete sense.

What about the others? Let's go on to Jeremy, and then Kay and Phil.

I came a bit later. Kay was before me.

Go on then, Kay. If you could just remind us again.

So I was living in Brighton with Simon, who I later married. We were living in a little bedsit, and we had a friend, or someone that we knew, who lived a few doors down. He was really our drug dealer. He used to come and supply us with cannabis and various things. We got to know him, and then one day he disappeared.

A few months later, we were down on the seafront in Brighton and looked up and suddenly saw him, but he looked so different. He looked really well. The way he dressed, he looked so different. Before, he looked really scruffy, a bit on his last legs, but he just looked completely different. He said, "Oh, I've met an Indian lady. I'll come round and tell you all about it."

So the next day he came round in the evening. He came into our little basement bedsit, and the walls were covered with pictures of deities. We had an Indian shop in Brighton—I can't remember what it was called now—and you could go in and buy all the pictures of the deities. So he came in, looked around, and said, "Oh, that's interesting." We were smoking a joint. He said, "Well, you can put that out for a start."

So he worked on us both. I don't know what I felt. I definitely felt something, but I was already feeling a bit off my head with the cannabis, so I didn't feel too much. I think I felt a bit of a cool breeze. But that night I had a dream. In the dream, I saw Mother on the top of a hill and she was speaking to multitudes of people. It was such a deep, profound dream. When I woke up the next morning, I just knew. I just knew who she was.

And I think when Jeremy—that was the name of the person that gave us our realisation, Jeremy Crisp—when he was working on us, it suddenly clicked because I'd been reading quite a bit about yoga and meditation. I'd read a book by a guy called Richard Hittleman who used to do yoga on the TV, and it described all the paths of yoga and explained about self-realisation. So Jeremy was explaining about the different deities, pointing to them on the wall. And then I thought, "Oh," so I said, "Are you saying that Shri Mataji's come now?" And he said, "Yes." I didn't feel that straight away, but the next morning after this dream, I felt it. That was it. I just knew. And then after that, I met Kingsley and Pam and Ray.

My first... when we got our realisation. So, yeah.

Amazing, how the divine play is, isn't it?

Yeah. Well, that's me. So, Jeremy, I don't know.

I'll go if you want. A funny thing is... do you want to know how I came to Sahaja Yoga?

Yes, please.

Right. So it was very interesting. I think Mother protected me from this bunch, because I was looking for a place to live in Brighton. I'd never been to Brighton and I just had this desire to go and live there. In fact, we've never told each other these stories. It's quite interesting.

I got a job in a marine insurance company and it was deadly boring, but it got me to a place near Brighton because my family comes from north of London. I don't really even remember why I wanted to go to Brighton, but I was drawn there. I was looking for places to live, and just when I found a place that was suitable, they said, "Oh, no, terribly sorry, it's just gone." This happened so many times. Then I found this room in a house in Brighton and I phoned up, and the lady answered and said, "Oh, terribly sorry, it's just gone." And I said, "Yeah, typical." She said, "Well, there might be another possibility. Why don't you come along?"

So I went along, and I've always been very suspicious, a bit like Kingsley, of gurus or anything Indian, because in the village I was living in beforehand, there was the Hare Krishna mob. I went along once and I thought, "My God, I'm never going to do anything like that." I've never done drugs, I've never done false gurus, none of this business. That's another funny story. When I introduced my brother, Shri Mataji said, "Oh, thank goodness, some normal people coming to Sahaja Yoga now."

Anyway, I saw this picture of Shri Mataji on the door of this house, and I was really in two minds whether to go in. Just when I was thinking of going away, the door opened and this big lady appeared with a huge grin and said, "Come in, come in." And it was Pamela. I went in and there were pictures of Shri Mataji all over the walls and down the stairs. We went and sat down in her little basement, and she offered me a cup of tea. She was doing this sort of movement on her cup of tea, and I said, "Are you looking for a spoon or something? What are you doing?" And she said, "No, I'm vibrating my tea." And I thought, "My God, she's really away with the fairies, this one."

She said, "Oh, you must get your realization." She pulled away a curtain in the middle of the room and there was a huge altar with all the photos of Mother and the feet and everything. She gave me my realization. I didn't feel much physically, but I felt a kind of joy inside of me. I felt that I'd really found something important. And interestingly, Shri Mataji had been there and there was a puja there the week before in that room.

So she said, "Oh, well, I've given away my room, but now you must stay." I didn't have a choice. She kicked Matthew, her son, out of his room and put me in his room. But the funny thing is I'd always had this kind of secret desire to be amongst hippies, because I was never a hippie. I came from a sort of middle-class family, a bit like Kingsley, but I'd never had the courage. I was young for the hippie period anyway, but I'd always had a kind of secret longing, probably because they were seekers and I didn't really know what I was seeking. So it's another example of how Mother fulfills every little desire. Brighton was the hippie center of Sahaja Yoga, no doubt. The gentle hippies. In Brighton, there was a lovely little family of very gentle people, and I really felt I'd found my family. This was another very strong feeling.

Please remind us when you got your realization.

Oh, sorry. Yes. It was autumn, sort of September, October time. I didn't keep a note, but it was 1980. The funny thing is that I felt all these guys had been in for years, because time moved very, very fast in those days. If you'd been in Sahaja Yoga a couple of years, you were an avatar, you were really someone. We had Shri Mataji with us. It seemed like these people had been doing it for years, and I came in and I remember meditating in Kingsley's little flat under the pyramid he had. It was a wooden pyramid, painted bright pink, a five-foot-high scale model of a Giza pyramid you could sit under. If you were really honoured, you would be allowed to sit under it. You could feel a cool breeze coming out the top of it. It was a privilege to meditate under it.

My first meeting with Shri Mataji must have been a Hampstead program. I remember a small meeting, I think it was Hampstead. I remember, particularly, that Shri Mataji was looking in my direction, but it wasn't like she was looking at me, she was looking through me. I kept on looking around to see what or who she was looking at, and there was no one there. It was like she was just looking through me, and I suppose working on me at the time. I just felt the full attention, the full force of the Adi Shakti on me. That was very powerful. That was my first impression, but I can't tell you exactly when it was. I'm afraid I didn't take notes.

Phil?

Okay, well, I actually started seeking consciously in my teens, having seen a map of the world in an atlas with different countries in different colours representing the religions. Iran was pale green for Shia Muslims, India was orange for Hindus, England was pink for Protestants, and France was red for Catholics, and so on. I realised that if I'd been born somewhere else, I wouldn't be going to church with my parents; we'd probably be going to the mosque or to the temple. So I started asking around, what do all these religions have in common? Which is the right one? Obviously, at church, that didn't go down very well. I found that nobody was really interested in answering the question.

At the time, I was going to a confirmation class. I was repeating these same questions in the class, and to this day, I'm proud of the fact that not only did I not get confirmed, but nobody else from the class got confirmed.

After that, before going to university, I went to work in Berlin for six months. There I met this German guy who'd been to India, lived in an ashram, and learned Indian music. I liked the guy. I could see that India had done something to him, which I couldn't put my finger on, but I wanted to have it. He was different. His priorities were different. So I resolved, after university, I wanted to go to India, which I did. In India, I read lots of books, visited various false gurus, and tried this yoga, that meditation. After several months, I was in quite a mess.

I mentally tossed a coin: do I go to Burma and become a Buddhist monk, or do I go back to the West and live a normal existence? The decision was to go back to the West. On my way through Delhi, I went to visit my first false guru. He did this 10-day yoga and meditation course where we were doing Hatha yoga, hyperventilating, and saying, "Om, Om, Om." You were supposed to see colors and light. I didn't. I was a bit disappointed, but still, he seemed quite sincere and honest. As far as I could tell, he wasn't into power or money.

I went to his place and started telling him all that I'd been doing, that I was in a mess and completely confused. I noticed he had a little diagram on the wall showing the kundalini and the chakras. I asked him to explain, and he started. The first chakra is about innocence and wisdom, the second is creativity, the third is satisfaction. I thought, "Wow, this is beautiful. This makes sense. Tell me more." He said, "Okay, I'm just going to check on the state of your chakras." I thought, "God, what a saint. He can feel other people's chakras, and I can't even feel my own."

He put this black and white photograph of an Indian lady on a little altar and said, "This is Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi. Hold out your hands. See if you can feel anything." I held out my hands and felt nothing at all. But as he went behind me and started raising my kundalini, I started feeling hotter and hotter. You could have almost fried an egg on top of my head. After about half a minute, the room was becoming darker and darker, and almost the only thing I could see were these waves of light coming from Shri Mataji's right hand. After maybe one or two minutes, I couldn't handle this any longer. Just as the kundalini rises in a split second, there's a certain movement in the opposite direction which is almost as fast. I had to run to the bathroom for a rapid clear out.

Then I came back, and he was a bit concerned because he'd never seen anyone react quite like that before. He said, "When you get back to London, you must go and see Shri Mataji. She's the only person who can do anything for you, either spiritually or physically." I'd never had an experience remotely like this at all. Even though it had been quite a drastic clear out, it still had me feeling there was something good going on here, something right.

So I went back to Newcastle, where I was staying, lightened my luggage considerably by throwing a lot of books of false gurus in the trash, and carried on traveling overland through India, Pakistan, and Iran, which was possible in those days. A month later, I found myself in Switzerland, visiting my brother. I was sitting in his room, and because I was quite bored, I was reading the local newspaper—even the advertisements. There I saw this same photograph of this Indian lady. The text said, "For the first time in Switzerland, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi talks about self-realization and the demystification of false gurus." And that was Shri Mataji in Lausanne, that evening.

I borrowed some clothes from my brother, because my own, after a year and a half on the road, were not in a good state, and went along to the program. Shri Mataji came in and launched into a very powerful and very funny speech. What impressed me very much was that with all the false gurus, they try to give you the impression that they are more powerful, more holy, wiser than you are. They put themselves on a pedestal. With Shri Mataji, it was not at all like that. She was just being her motherly self, making a lot of fun of all this nonsense that I and presumably other people had been doing. The whole thing was very enjoyable.

What year was that?

This was April 1980.

At the end of the program—oh yes, at one point in the program, Shri Mataji looked straight at me and said, "He's got it. May God bless you." After the program, new people were invited to the flat where she was staying. Shri Mataji was working on various people, and this was tremendously impressive to see. She would be putting her foot on the void of this person here, working on this person here, and checking with that person there that they were holding their hands out of the window to clear out as she had recommended, all while pursuing a conversation with other people sitting around. She was tremendously dynamic.

After this program, there was talk of a Hindu ceremony which was going to take place the next day, a puja. Although I'd been in South Asia for quite a while, I'd never actually been to a puja, and it sounded very interesting. I started asking, "Can I come to this puja thing?" I asked Gregoire, who seemed to be organising things, and he was a bit shocked. He launched into a recital of all the good reasons why new people with vibrations in tatters like mine should take their time to clear out and gain an understanding. He was going through this catalog when Shri Mataji walked past and said, "What does he want?" "Oh, he wants to come to the puja, Mother." "Yes, yes, he can come."

So that was my first puja the next day. Again, in the flat where Shri Mataji had been staying, we were about 15 to 20 people. I remember there were a lot of things read in Sanskrit, and then something was read in English about a great goddess killing demons. Mentally, I understood practically nothing. But at the same time, inwardly, I was kind of telling my mind to shut up because I had this feeling that something very auspicious, beautiful, important, and sacred was taking place, and that I was privileged to be part of it. At the end of the puja, everybody bowed down to Shri Mataji. And, when in Rome, do as the Romans do, so I also bowed down. Shri Mataji said to Gregoire, "Look how he's taking, look how he's sucking vibrations," speaking of me. From the tone of her voice—I didn't know what vibrations were, much less what sucking vibrations meant—but from the tone of Mother's voice, I understood that I was doing something right.

That was my first meeting with Shri Mataji and my first puja. Then I went back to England, to my parents' place in the north, trying to meditate with this photograph of Shri Mataji and frankly, not feeling anything. I had this fading memory of this beautiful experience in Switzerland, which was not coming back. I tried to meditate and felt nothing at all, apart from feeling a bit stupid. Doubts started coming. Was this just a dream? It was really the collective that pulled me out of that.

For my postgraduate study, I had the choice of the Open University at Milton Keynes or Sussex University in Brighton. In Brighton there were yogis, and so that decided it. I arrived in Brighton in August 1980, about a month after Mother had been there for a Buddhism program, and met up with the yogis, and so it went on. Those were my early days.

Thank you everyone for sharing your stories about how you got your self-realization and your first meeting with Shri Mataji. There must have been some things that you really want to share with all of us, and for seekers in the future as well. What was it, in Brighton, being with Shri Mataji or meditating?

I think at the time, there were a few of us, and we were all like a family. It did feel like finding your family, the people that you'd always wanted to be with. I remember we used to go up to London every Monday to Caxton Hall, and quite often on a Sunday up to Dollis Hill to the ashram to see Mother. In London, everyone was quite different, quite serious. But in Brighton, it just felt like we had such a good time together. We really enjoyed each other's company. I look back on it now as one of the best times of my life. It was just so much fun.

But there were things that happened there. One of them, which I think we've probably talked about before, was we did all get possessed at one point and mesmerized by a man that came along. I think maybe because we were all, I suppose, a bit on the left, sort of hippie types, and very trusting of everyone. We were not completely connected to reality in many ways. This man came to a meeting—I think it was sometime in 1980, because I'd only had my realisation about six months or so when he came along.

Mother came to the meeting, and there were a few new people there, but there was this man sat at the back who looked like your typical kind of hippie guru person.

I thought he looked like Jesus. He had long hair, yes. He looked like the Roman Jesus. A long beard.

Mother was coming round to talk to us all and work on the new people. We asked him what his name was, and he said very gravely, "My name is Michael." And we thought, "Hello, hello, hello... Michael." Being as Kay puts it very nicely, very sweetly, we were I suppose quite naive. We thought, "Hello, Archangel Michael," or something. He had that air about him.

Shri Mataji came round, he stood up, she embraced him and said, "Until you came, Michael, there was only me to do the work." And this was what really impressed us.

So he came into the group, and over a period of weeks, he got closer and closer to everyone. What we noticed, looking back, was that our meditations were less intense. We were less warm and loving with each other, because we were very close. Eventually, he got to the point where he was telling us that we shouldn't go up to London anymore because there was a "TM cell" there, and we were like the Holy Grail, the good ones. We thought, "Wow, this is amazing."

It was very powerful. He had siddhis, there's no two ways about it. I remember once walking down from Brighton Clock Tower, and he came out from a shop front, walked up to me, and looked me in the eyes. I thought, "Hello, he's reading my mind." He could read your mind. He had what we understand as siddhis.

So eventually, he said the Holy Spirit can never incarnate as a human being, and we shouldn't go up to London anymore. Phil and I said, "Hang on a minute. No one's going to stop us going up to see our Mother." It got really bad over a period of several weeks. It went in little by little, easy steps. He was separating us from the collective as a whole. For example, at one point he suggested we mustn't take too many vibrations from Mother, we must let her recover. So he had us meditate on a rose or something.

He was saying that important people in the London collective were trying to sabotage Sahaja Yoga, and that we should have nothing to do with them. As it happened, Shri Mataji had expressed concern.

Eventually, Phil and I got on the train to London, got up there late to the program at Caxton Hall. We were sort of whispering as we went, and people said, "Oh, there you are," because they hadn't seen Brighton people for a while. Afterwards, we went and told Mataji what was happening. To our astonishment, she rocked with laughter. She said, "Oh, really. You'd better come back to my flat."

At the beginning of the program, we were feeling absolutely horrible. We saw all the Sahaja Yogis around, and they seemed to be enjoying themselves so much, so joyful and lighthearted. Then Kingsley had the courage to go and speak to Shri Mataji, and then we went down to her apartment. We found ourselves sitting on the floor just in front of her while she was sitting on the sofa. She asked us, "Do I look like I'm losing my powers?" And we said, "No, Shri Mataji." Then she closed her eyes, and the room became very silent for a few seconds. Then she said, "Whatever has happened is forgiven. You must laugh at yourselves."

Afterwards, Shri Mataji gave a cup of tea to everybody. So there we were, drinking a lovely, vibrated tea. Then we went back to Brighton with Paul Winter in his car. I think we had to stop once or twice because we had to throw up again, with the fast clear out. Kingsley and I were in very high spirits, resolving that if this guy came again, we'd throw him downstairs. We went to the next weekly program armed with lots of lemons and chilies and put them in all corners of the room.

At Navaratri Puja, Shri Mataji had all the Brighton people come and sit around the Havan. The Puja was immediately followed by a Havan, and we had to sit there with pieces of coal in our hands. We held the piece of coal and had to say, "Mother, I will obey you for the rest of my life." Then we offered the coal to the fire.

Yes, we haven't actually heard of this before.

And then she looked at us and said, "Sorry my children, but someone had to be crucified." As if it was something that had to happen. We had to learn about the strength of our faith in her and in ourselves.

When we went to her flat, I remember walking in, and she looked—the only time I've ever seen her looking other than she always seems to look—very, very young, in a sort of big bubble. I remember her putting her hand on our heads and realising in about five minutes that we had been hypnotised. You always think that hypnotism is a stage thing, and that you have to be willing to be hypnotised. We hadn't known. It had happened in spite of ourselves. This was the fantastic lesson. And this is why I say this will never happen to any of these people who were there at the time, again. When people come into Sahaja Yoga and they behave in that sort of way, you can smell it, you can feel it. And that was the lesson that she wanted to give us. It's the most valuable lesson ever, I think.

How long did this hypnosis last? And what are the lessons learned?

Several people couldn't handle it, because we had to go back to our little family, Phil and I, and say, "It was a hoax. We were fooled, we were hypnotized." This was horrible, and some people couldn't take it.

The problem with you guys is you want to become the spirit, but you don't know how to play the game. She said, "You all want to become the spirit, but when I help you become the spirit, you all say, 'Oh no, Mother, not like this. Please, not like this.'" You have to go through some tapas or some experience to lose whatever it is you have to lose of this artificialness, whether it's ego, super-ego, conditioning, or arrogance. You have to get rid of it in order to become the spirit. But it's like wanting to become the spirit but not letting go of anything that you hold dearly, like your little personality.

We didn't know the rules. That's why Mother forgave us so much at the beginning. She didn't forgive Indians in the same way; she said because Indians know the rules. But we had no idea. We kind of thought that everything was a bed of roses at the beginning because for us, it was coming from the hell that we were living in to this magic world around Shri Mataji. To be in the same room as Shri Mataji was literally heaven. You just wanted it to last forever. She knew you, she cared for you, she cared for each of us individually. She brought you into that lovely, warm, friendly, loving atmosphere that she created. And we were a family.

From what I can remember of this Michael, I think he flattered us. It was a bit of an ego trip, really. I think that's what people do when they mesmerize you. They make you feel special, like you're the only one that knows what's going on. It's kind of like the conspiracy thing now. If you think you're the only one that really knows what's going on, you feel very... it's an ego trip. And I think we all got well and truly sucked in. But I do remember sitting in our public program, and Kingsley and Phil came back. I remember you, Kingsley, coming into the room and going, "Guys, he's a fake! He's a fake!" The minute you said that, my Kundalini just shot up. And that was it. The spell was gone. The spell had broken.

We did suffer for it. Myself and Pam were probably more sucked into it than Kingsley and Phil. And both of us ended up with cancer.

Please elaborate on that, if you don't mind.

Pam had breast cancer, and I also ended up with cancer. I won't go into it all now because I think in the first Golden Memories I talked about that. But when Mother worked on me, she told me that it was because of a few things—I'd taken too many drugs, the contraceptive pill—and she said, "But it's this man, this Michael." She told me to go and rest in the room above her bedroom. I went and lay down, fell asleep, and had a dream that I was in a minibus full of yogis and we ran over him. After that, I kept feeling much better. For the following few weeks, Mother worked on me and cleared it out. I was in quite a bad way, and that was as a result of that. So if you get drawn into these things, your system suffers, your Spirit suffers.

Miracles that you'd like to share? Any outstanding miracles? For us, miracles become a norm, isn't it? Every little thing that Shri Mataji does, we personally just sort of take it for granted. It's like, okay, it's just a way of life.

But in those days, I think from a cultural point of view, you see, you come from a different area of Father Earth to us. And you can't imagine how lighthearted—is the word you used earlier—this whole expression of Sahaja Yoga in our lives was. For me, it wasn't quite like Jeremy; it was a completely natural phenomenon, somehow. In a sense, having used—it's very, very unpolitically correct to say this—but having had experience of happy hallucinogenic drugs kind of prepared me, in a sense, for meeting all of these phenomena.

Because I come, like most of us, from post-war Western, an English, comfortable sort of... I was an only child, but we lived an interesting time if you were born just after the war. And the whole counties and all of this cozy English blah, blah, blah. And so, for me, having been quite abnormal all my life as a seeker, it was very... So for me, the miracle... and I never believed in miracle photographs. And I'll say this to you because a lot of people, most people say, "Oh, look at this." I don't give a thing for miracle photographs.

For me, I say, people these days... Here I am, forty years on from our marriage in Switzerland. Philip got his realization there and came to Switzerland. I was all over the place and ended up in Switzerland. And after 40 years of marriage at Shri Mataji's suggestion... if you want a miracle, it was before there were ever marriage forms or a marriage committee or anything like that. And here I am today, and everything that's happening. And it occurs to me, very metaphysically, that everything that is happening is because of her. And my son, who was born in Sahaja Yoga, is well... "Of course, Dad, She's the Adi Shakti." It doesn't strike me like that, somehow. I pull my ears. I mean, of course, She is. But it's somehow as if I was born into it, sort of ready-made.

My first experience of Kundalini was rather like listening to a Carlos Santana guitar solo. Beautiful. Something up the spine. And if you're lucky, as I have been—and everybody who knows me says I'm just so lucky—the miracle really is to be existing in a world where there's Sahaja Yoga and this wonderful family. And here we are, my wife and I, in Switzerland, in a marvelous collectivity, and with old friends in London, in England, and what have you. And it's bliss. You want miracles? Life itself. Looking around at the state of the world in general, one feels enormously blessed and saved. I wasn't saved, rather as Jeremy suggests, from a previous life, because my life was always kind of odd and wonderful. I feel today, as I'm an old geezer, I'm saved in a world that's going completely crazy, and where truth is upside down. So if you want miracles, I'm sitting here, a living miracle, a living example.

Why it's so important doing these interviews is you as individuals, as Sahaja Yogis, having spent that time in her enormous love that only a mother can have. And in that compassion, she took, as the Mother... as a seeker, She's the only one who actually came to the West and taught the yogis of the West everything they need to know. And that is what we are trying to record so that, in years to come, in centuries to come, people may find it unbelievable that such an incarnation actually took all that trouble and took all that care and love and transformed our lives to give life a meaning and a purpose that was connected to the power that created us. So yes, it's very important that you're sharing these examples with us.

Well, we're all different, you see, just the four of us. But it seems to me, I'm a little bit shy of all these things, in a sense. But if you look at history and you see the mess that the Romans had to deal with with the early Christians, who were complete fanatics, who were bumping themselves off rather than shaking hands with the local Roman governor. They were fanatics, like Daesh or ISIS. If you look at the state of all the religions when they go to extremes... as Mother said, "beautiful flowers on a tree," but people end up killing each other because they're right and the others are wrong.

The important thing for future generations, if we can just transmit the love and the peace and the beauty of the experience we had... you would be going to her feet, and she would be drinking tea and laughing, and it was absolutely beautiful. It was captivating. Amazing. I don't have the adequate verb to describe that experience. I can only feel the joy and the beauty of it. And the cool vibes.

Kingston, do you remember on Guru Nanak's birthday in 1980, when she was distributing ties to the men? Oh, God. Everybody got one which fitted what they were wearing at that moment. Absolutely. The ties were wrapped, yes. She wasn't actually looking at them, and she gave them out. I think you had a herringbone shirt, and you had a herringbone tie. Yes, it was absolutely amazing. And I think that she hadn't even wrapped them herself, if you recall. They were wrapped for her, and she gave the right tie to the right person. This was extraordinary. If you want a little, sweet example of a miracle, there you are. The attention to detail was exquisite.

I only really saw one miracle. This was the last Navaratri Puja that Shri Mataji attended in 2010. I was working on transport, so I had the occasion to be posted at the back of the castle where Shri Mataji would come out, waiting to take some people to the hangar. It was extremely windy, and the yogis were trying to arrange some sort of framework with pieces of wood and plastic sheeting on either side of the bridge that leads down from the castle to the car park so that Shri Mataji would not be affected by the wind. And every time they put something up, whoosh, the wind came and blew it away, or it broke, or it just collapsed.

The time was approaching when Shri Mataji was going to come. The yogis were getting more and more desperate. And then the door opened, and Shri Mataji appeared. The wind stopped. It was like pressing a button. It stopped completely, like switching the light on. Shri Mataji came down the stairs and got into the car. The car door closed. Whoosh. The wind started again. I think we were all just completely awestruck.

That was the year when we probably had big hailstones and all sorts of weather that evening before that puja, if I remember correctly. But yes, amazing.

I remember a time we had a journalist that worked for The Argus in Brighton, and he wrote a negative article about Sahaja Yoga. It wasn't horrendously negative, but it wasn't complimentary. And after that, there were enormous hailstones. Remember them? Enormous things that you've never seen anything like before. And they just broke people's car windows. I think that was a result of him writing that.

I remember, talking of people writing in newspapers, probably the most extraordinary experience I ever had. I was working in my little travel office in Shoreham-by-Sea, near Brighton, and it would be just before Christmas. I don't know if it was 1983 or '84. No, it couldn't be '84. '82, '83. And there was a half-page advertisement for TM in The Guardian, I think it was. I had time to read the newspaper; it was a quiet office. I was furious, and I phoned them up. And I said, "What the hell do you know what you're doing with this character?" And I really tore them off a strip and said, "You're supposed to be a liberal newspaper, and these people are destroying people's lives," and so on.

Later that afternoon, I was correcting a pile of leaflets with misprinted bus timetables or something banal on it. And suddenly, the top of my head wasn't there. To infinity. I thought, "I'm not thinking." You're sort of observing yourself, and you aren't thinking, and you're just astonished. This was the most powerful experience I've ever had. And I realized it was, if you like, a boon. It was just a demonstration of, "You did the right thing."

A few things that I was remembering was when Mother came down to Brighton. I don't think I was in the car, but I think they... I think Mother asked whoever was driving to go around Devil's Dyke in Brighton. And then she said, "Now it's Devi's Dyke." Mother loved wordplay, didn't she? Devil to Devi. She loved wordplay.

And I remember another time during one of the visits to Brighton, we ended up walking around The Lanes with Mother. I think there was a small group of us, and it was after the shops were shut, but we were kind of window shopping, just looking in all the windows. I remember at the time, it felt like being with your very best friend. It was just so close and so amazing that we were there. Mother was talking about all the different things in the shops. And there was an Italian shop that sold these beautiful ceramics. Mother went and spent a long time looking in the window, and she said, "I've got a weakness for ceramics." Something like that. And it just made you go... just thinking about it, what can you say?

So, one minute, Mother would really make herself one of us and be there with us on such a human level. And then the next minute, you're in front of God almighty. It's just mind-blowing. You can't really get your head around it at all.

And I remember another time we had a trip to the beach. I think Mother came and stayed with her grandchildren. I think the grandchildren came as well. Yes, there are photos of that event. We went to the beach and the arcade. The grandchildren all played in the arcades.

And then I think it was maybe the same day, or maybe it was the day before, but we all went and sat on the beach. I always remember there was a couple next to us, and they were there with their bikinis and suntan lotion. And after about five, ten minutes, they started to get dressed. It was like they really didn't know why they were getting dressed. They just looked so confused and bewildered, but they just put all their clothes on and just sat there. They just really didn't know what was happening to them at all.

And then I remember Mother told us all to go and foot soak, to go and stand in the sea. So we all went down and stood in the sea. And then I think it was Pam or someone said, because we were all facing the sea, Pam said, "We should be facing Mother." We just didn't think. So then we all turned around and stood in the sea with our hands out to Mother, who was still sat on the beach. It was just... I remember it being such an amazing, amazing sort of... Did you have a picnic on the beach on that occasion or other occasions? Because she liked picnics in the summer. It happened in London a lot later, didn't it? There was a big picnic in the park.

I remember, yes, when Mother stayed in Pam's house. I remember Pam had this ex-husband who looked really like one of the asuras in the Indian comics. He had the kind of mustache, and his name was As. And Pam used to joke it was like an asura. So I remember one time when Mother was staying at Pam's house and was asleep upstairs, he turned up at the door, and Pam was having this argument with him. But after that, I think he just went and left her alone completely.

And then we had a puja there that time. Also, some people came. There was a squat nearby, and I think some of the people from the squat had come to the meeting. Mother asked for them all to come. So all these different people from this squat came, and Mother spent a long time talking to them and working on them. Really spent time with them, sort of listening to them and asking them about what they did in their lives. She really wanted to know everything about them. I don't think any of them ever stuck to Sahaja Yoga, but it was like she was all the time working on us, on the humans, on the human condition, to try and work it all out. Amazing.

And I think I also remember at the same time... I think Graham has probably told this story before, but we were in Pam's house, up the stairs. And I think Graham said something like, "Shri Mataji, what is the relevance of human beings in the universe?" or words to that effect. And then Mother said to him, "Well, of all the universes, this is the most important universe. And of all the worlds, this world is the most important in the universe. And of all the species, the human beings. And of the human beings, the Sahaja Yogis."

And I remember at that point, Pam was there, and for some reason, her tooth had dropped out, and she had it stuck in with Blu-Tack. Oh no. And at that point, Pam's mouth just dropped open. And then her tooth came out, but she just kind of caught it. And we were just all... it was just an incredible sort of moment when Mother said that. It was mind-blowing. So profound, and yet so funny. Profound. You could write a book about Pamela. One of the most extraordinary characters we ever knew in Sahaja Yoga. Departed. Extraordinary lady with an amazing devotion. She would drop everything and go anywhere in the world to be with Shri Mataji.

Tell us about The Boons, please, if you would. The story of the boon that Shri Mataji named Pamela's shop. The Boon, wasn't it? Would you recollect for us the story about Pamela and her shop, please?

Well, it was just a little shop selling Indian things—incense and baubles. I don't remember precisely. I remember the beautiful, like a rainbow, sign that she painted for the shop front. It was just a little chapter. And if you look at Pamela's life, my goodness, it's a tiny part of her life. She ended up as a hatter. She was making hats for London society. And before that, she was making jewelry out of seashells. And before Sahaja Yoga, she was probably dealing dope and God knows what.

I remember we had someone who came along to one of those very early programs, perhaps at my place, and he was a lodger at her house in Kemptown. And one day, someone comes to the door, and there's this pretty blonde at the door saying, "Hello." And this was Pamela. She came and she got her realization. And the extraordinary thing was—and it could only have happened with her—was that to explain what Sahaja Yoga was, we did the I Ching together. Because I always did the I Ching before Sahaja Yoga, almost daily. It's such a wonderful book. In fact, the I Ching was there in an exhibition we had of Sahaja books in London once, and it figured alongside the Bible and the Quran and everything else. We did the I Ching with yarrow stalks, and we got the hexagram "Work on What Has Been Spoiled" moving through to "The Army." It completely blew my mind, and I think it hers as well. And that's how Pamela came into Sahaja Yoga.

Shortly after Shri Mataji's visit, Pamela was summoned to the school where Matthew was attending. I think Matthew was primary school age. The headmaster said to her very seriously, "Mrs. Bromley, your son said the Virgin Mary stayed at your house." And Pamela said, "Yes, it's true."

She could get away with all sorts of things. She once came back from India via Paris with 70 kilos of stuff in her bags to sell at the shop, and she didn't have to pay a penny for excess bags. And somehow, she managed to get it from the airport to the train station, onto the train, onto the boat—because there was no tunnel at the time—onto the train to London. And somehow she managed. I don't know how, with 70 kilos of stuff. Amazing. And the name of her shop was symbolic, wasn't it?

Pamela was the first person in our group... I never dreamt of going to India. And Pamela was the first person from our little Brighton group who went. So she'd come back, and we'd say, "How was it, Pamela?" and so on. She was completely serene, as if it was the most natural thing in the world. She was extraordinary. It's hard to describe Pamela. She was really a one-off and an amazing person.

We had the good fortune to have her for our first series of interviews way back in 2010. She brought along a load of albums that we had the privilege to see of her times. Oh my goodness, that's amazing. And in fact, recollecting that instance where the headmaster called, Matthew was saying how he told them, "Yes, God visited. God slept in my bed." And they couldn't quite believe it, so his mom was called. It's just amazing that these are parallel worlds. How it's so true for us, and yet absolutely incomprehensible to many of those people.

People were a little bit shy to talk about it. Mother always talked about the woman sitting next to her on the airplane and having no qualms about talking about the false gurus. And yet we were very reluctant to mention it. Pam was just totally... no qualms, no shame, no nothing. She was just in her element. She was totally in that world. I owe a lot to Pam because she gave me my realization, and I lived it. To begin with, I just moved into Sahaja Yoga.

But about boons, going back to boons. There's a couple of things I would like to say. There were pujas when Mother said, "Okay, ask me a boon." I remember one Guru Puja in Austria—I don't know if you were there, but I'm sure some of the other people here were. She had spoken about how we have to become the guru. And then at the end, she said, "Okay, ask me a boon." Of course, we bowed down, and I'm sure a lot of us asked to become the guru. And Mother said, "And don't ask to become a guru." It was like, what?

Anyway, the real thing is that another important lesson I learned was: be careful what you ask for, because you'll get it. And in Sahaja Yoga, you did. Mother blessed us all with what we've dreamt of. Look at the possibilities people have. They can become artists, they can become musicians, they can speak in public. You basically can do whatever you wanted. And what I was saying before about how you have to go through things... you also have to face your worst fear. It's all the things that I've always never wanted to do. And again, never say never, because it'll happen. I never wanted to be a teacher; I ended up being a teacher. I never wanted to live in Milan; I ended up living in Milan. I never wanted to live in that part of Milan, and I lived in that part of Milan. It's like, you have to be so careful.

Wherever your attention goes, that is what the Divine works out. So it doesn't distinguish. I was listening to someone talk about this, very interesting. The Divine doesn't distinguish between what you want and what you don't want. And that's why Mother said, again, about the importance of attention. Because wherever your attention is, you go towards that. That's why people who've always got their attention on negative things, negative things happen to them. And people who are positive... and that's why Mother said, "Put your attention on the spirit," and you go to it.

In the West, we don't understand it. We don't have this concept of how important the attention is. And they were the boons, really. We didn't really consider them boons, but they were. Again, going back to what was said, it's like, for you it's miracles, but for the Divine, it's normal. It's a bit like that expression: the impossible we do immediately, miracles take a bit longer. For the Divine, boons are not miracles. They are something that happens when the Divine is pleased, or something has to work out. Maybe you please the Divine in some way, or you just put your attention on it, and if it's going to help in your spiritual growth, then it will happen, whether you like it or not.

My husband says, "I desire just the pure desire."

Yes, the pure spirit. But you see, that's a curious thing. "Pure desire" is like a contradiction. You shouldn't have desires. And that's also with Mother. You see the way She says, "Oh, I don't have desires." But then She does. What is going on? It's the desire of the Divine. All this Maya. It's her play. We didn't do anything. We didn't ask for this. It's her play. It's her desire. So it's kind of interesting. There's a play within the play, and we're just literally actors on the stage.

Reminding one of the statements that you'd made earlier about... was it "the game of the spirit" or "being the spirit"? I would love to hear that.

In those days, these talks weren't recorded, but basically, She was saying that life is a game. You have to know the rules. The problem is, you want to play the game, but you don't know the rules.

What are the rules?

If I knew! No, one of the rules is that tapas is related to spiritual growth. You can't grow without some tapas, without some effort. This is extremely important. The way that people don't realize the difference between sacrifice and suffering. They think when something happens that they suffer, then it's something negative. But look at all the deities, all the incarnations. Look at who you want. They suffered. But suffering is a choice, in the sense that... okay, maybe it's a sacrifice, but it's a choice to suffer. In the early days, we had this thing about, "Okay, yes, tapas." But then Mother was saying, "Enjoy your tapas." That's the art. It's not suffering. "Enjoy your tapas." So there was a whole new dimension to spiritual growth. Because that's the game. If you know it's for your growth, then you can enjoy it.

About a week, ten days ago, we were talking to Dr. Nigam of Delhi, and he was saying how Shri Mataji told the Sahaja Yogis of those days that it's very important to be joyful, not to be sad. And it's important to be in that state for Mother Kundalini to rise. That's just corroborating what you're saying. As long as we're enjoying ourselves, the suffering no longer is a suffering. It's part of a play.

Exactly. And people are afraid. Shri Mataji was saying how when She asked someone to do something, they'd say, "Oh, Mother, no, because I don't want my ego to develop," because basically, it would involve maybe some suffering or sacrifice. But enjoyment is so important. I remember one old couple going up to Shri Mataji after a meeting and asking for her advice. She just looked at them and said, "Just enjoy yourself." Again, for English people, that word "enjoy"... for a lot of people, it's not a natural state, if I may say so.

For a foreigner coming to England, it must be very strange. And for me, living abroad... I think Shri Mataji, partly because we are the heart, really wanted the English to leave England and circulate. And that's why, look, you've got Kingston in Switzerland, you've got Phil who's been all over the place, I've been all over the place. A lot of English were sent out to spread the energy of the heart. And I think it's really important for the conditioning of all to live abroad, to get out of your conditioning of your country. Especially people like Kingsley...

I had to be dragged. I had to be dragged out of that flat by the other yogis. I was there. You were there. I was so attached to my little flat, my £25-a-month flat above a Chinese restaurant. I didn't want to go to an ashram. Good heavens. And I swore I would never leave England. I was very anti-bourgeois, and I ended up being married to a Swiss diplomat and living everywhere in Europe, going to India and Nepal and Egypt and, oh God. And it's a funny thing, I didn't know what my biggest desires really were, and I've lived them all. It's extraordinary. I couldn't get girlfriends; they were too sensible. And Mother married me to the most extraordinary woman in the world. You don't even know what you want.

And I probably never told you this, Kingsley, but it was in India, and She called for me. I went to her, and Mother was rolling around laughing. And she said, "Jeremy, I found someone for Kingsley!" And she was rolling about the floor laughing. When Mother laughs, it's just the most amazing...

I'm happy to hear that, Jeremy. Because really, when we were on that week tour before we got married in '84, we went before Mother and bowed to her, and she was on a dais. There were lots of flowers, we offered her flowers, and she was throwing flowers at us and laughing and laughing and laughing. She said, "You are my master stroke." And then, when we were on honeymoon in Venice, we actually had the temerity to send her a postcard. Later that year, she said I was the Romeo of the year. When you talk about joy, it's just that, isn't it? One melts.

Have you seen that video circulating very recently? It was Jose doing his imitations of all the yogis in front of Shri Mataji. Have you seen that one? And she was, again, really in fits of laughter. It was really, really fun, and it brought back those magic days when we were just having fun. Okay, it got a little bit out of hand, and Mother didn't like people making fun, but it was just making fun of people's ego, in a way.

Mother's sense of humor was extraordinary. The stories she would tell, you would end up rolling on the floor yourself with laughter. There was the story of old Mr. Pie who was in the river in India, and his false teeth fell out, and he was looking for them. Mother was telling us this, and it was just extraordinary. We often think of that one. She imitated all the leaders and was really making fun of them. She was just so approachable and just wanting to be like one of us.

Humor opens the heart. There's a lovely word in Italian, I don't know if you know, which is spiritoso. Spiritoso means that kind of light-humoredness. So the spirit is connected with humor. She actually said you can always tell a spiritual person because they're funny. Or the contrary, you can tell when someone isn't spiritual because they've got no sense of humor. There you go. Another pearl of wisdom.

Which brings us to: each one of you, what are the kind of things that you remember Shri Mataji telling you, advising you, telling you off perhaps, or cajoling you, that you'd like to share with us?

When Mother came to Brighton, when we were at My Park Road, I remember Mother being in the bedroom. I went in, and she asked me to sit down on the bed next to her. And then she told me how Shri Ganesha was made. I'd had cancer, I was not in a good way. My left side was a problem. But after that, something in me shifted. She told me the story of Shri Ganesha and how Shri Parvati had made him out of clay, and how he stood outside the bedroom. Amazing.

It reminds me, again, same place, same road. You have to remember, I was quite new in Sahaja Yoga. Shri Mataji was there in that front room, which was quite a small room. Mother was sitting there, and there were some new people. There was one boy who was ill; he just had a cough or flu or something. Shri Mataji asked for some honey. So I went to get some honey from the kitchen. This boy was coughing, and this honey was quite thick. So I thought, well, this honey is going to be too thick. I thought of heating some water and mixing it with the honey.

Obviously, this took a bit of time to heat the kettle. Someone came in and said, "Shri Mataji is asking where you are. What are you doing?" I said, "Okay, I'm bringing the honey." It was a very good lesson for me because when I got back into the room, Shri Mataji said, "What are you doing? Where have you been?" And I explained I was heating the water. She said, "I just asked for the honey. If I asked for honey, I want honey. If I wanted it with water, I would have asked for it with water." It was like, just do what I say. This was a very, very important lesson. Don't interpret or don't go off on your own idea. Just do what I say. Fabulous. Again, in a very sweet way, but it was firm. Luckily, I've seen people really being blasted, if you like. I've never had that.

The only time that I wanted Shri Mataji's advice... before the ISPS was ready, it was just a refuge in the mountains. I don't know if you ever saw it in its original state. It was very primitive. They were trying to get it ready. So the Swiss had arranged for all the children to go to a kind of school they'd made. There were only about 10 kids at the beginning, mainly Swiss. They had a teacher and everything. And then Shri Mataji said, "So where are the children going to go?" The Swiss said, "Don't worry Mother, we've got it all worked out. They're coming to us." And Shri Mataji said, "Oh yeah? Really? Where are you going to put them? Oh, in Switzerland? No way." Mother did not want them to go to Switzerland.

So we were in the ashram in Milan, where I was staying, and she said, "No, they can come here. It's very nice here. There's a big garden," because she wanted them in Italy. So, at one point before they came, I went to Shri Mataji and I said, "So Mother, could you give me some advice on what to do with these children?" because they were going to come to our ashram. And she just looked at me and just said, "You're a Sahaja Yogi, get on with it." I don't remember Mother giving any specific advice on things. She never gave any marriage advice, apart from the public talks.

I don't know about advice. Apart from everything that she told us, all I ever had to do was say, "Yes, please," and "Thank you." Really.

Those talks, those early talks, she was giving advice for every little detail. What we had to do, what we didn't do, what we should and shouldn't do. Even to brushing your teeth and combing your hair. Every little detail she was giving. So it wasn't much individual advice.

It's just so nice to have this opportunity that Shri Mataji has given us to remember those times with all of you. Thank you so much for being with us this evening and sharing your lovely memories and moments with Shri Mataji. Even now, just remembering how we would do puja to Shri Mataji or just spend an evening with her at Chiswick when she was in London, and before that in Ganapati Pule, it's just like beyond time. As of yesterday, wasn't it?

So when did you come in, Sushmita?

You were talking about the miracle photos. A colleague, a friend who actually lives in Switzerland, showed me the book of miracle photographs. We were working at India Today in Connaught Place. I saw Shri Mataji's photograph as a child, and I was just struck by it. I very shyly asked my friend, "Who is she?" And she said, "Oh, she's my auntie's guru." And I couldn't get any more than that.

Then there were public programs in Lucknow, where I grew up, and my parents and I would say, "Okay, we'll go to the program," but somehow a visitor would drop in, or something would happen, and we wouldn't go. It took someone to actually handhold you when you are new to Sahaja Yoga. That actually happened way later when I was working in Delhi with India Today. This colleague and I were sharing accommodation. We were hosting a golfing tournament for CEOs. At night, we were all exhausted, and she took out this photo of Shri Mataji and put it by the bedside and was reading The Divine Cool Breeze. And I was like, "Wow, this is my moment. If I don't ask her now, I'll never know who this amazing lady is."

So I asked her, and she said, "Oh, she is Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi." Her mother is a devotee of Shri Mataji. She said, "I can give you the address of the center that's nearest to you." So she did. As soon as we were back at work, on a Thursday in January, I got my so-called self-realization, which was amazing. When the lady raised my Kundalini, I could just feel the vibrations going up, and the feeling in my heart was I had come home. Even working in Delhi, being an Indian, I still didn't feel it was normal, the way people lived. When I got my realization, I was like, "Wow, I've come home."

So Friday, I took the train home to Lucknow and gave my parents their self-realization and took them to the Lucknow center. The rest is history, as they say. That was the late '90s, early 2000s. Then Shri Mataji matched Shankar, my husband, and me at Ganapati Pule in 2001, and we got married in 2002 at the Shri Ganesh Puja in Cabella.

And more recently—it's a miracle, but it's normal—we had this desire that our children should go to ISPS, the International Sahaj Public School. So we took our son there, and the principal of the school said to my husband, "Oh, we need a geography teacher." His subject at uni was geography. I looked at him, and he was like, "No, we are detached parents. We are going back home." He gave me a nice spiel about being a detached mother. I said, "Fine."

We came back next year. Our daughter wanted to be with her brother. She kept pestering, "I want to go and be with my brother." So we took her next year. And that year, they needed an English teacher. Now, he's a native English speaker and had taught English as a foreign language in London for several years. I didn't say anything this time. My husband comes after his wash and says, "Do you want to check the vibrations about this?" And I was like, "Oh, that's nice." It was so cool. So we went there in 2011 and we were there till 2015. Our son did from class one to class ten there, and our daughter did class one to class twelve. It's really nice to see how Shri Mataji worked it all out effortlessly for us.

Interesting, because you come from the other side of the fence, as it were.

Yes, I could so relate to all the things you were saying about being in the West, where the culture is completely different. Things like dharma... well, there are the Ten Commandments and the values, but they're so depleted. It's just amazing. And this wave is sweeping the world, I guess. The hope is Shri Mataji.

(Goodbyes are exchanged)

It's just the tip of the iceberg, really, isn't it? We just touched on it. There's so much more. So many people want these stories to be known. This is collective desire working out. I really admire you for doing all this work.

It's part of the play. Especially doing it like this, because to sit down and write it, you think, "Oh my God," with a blank piece of paper, it doesn't really work. But when you get together with a group of people like this, one thing leads to another, and we remind each other of things. You learn a lot, you remember a lot. It's very, very important. There are so many things which weren't recorded in the early days. If we don't put it down now, outside of the talks that Mother gave, it will be lost. And so much has been. So many people aren't in Sahaja Yoga anymore for one reason or another. It's a valuable job.

Thank you so much for your love and for sharing the stories. Do pen down instances that you remember, and at some point in the future, maybe we'll regroup and share.

I've got some notes. They're just in note form. Someone was going to do this similar sort of thing but never got around to it, so I did kind of think, "Oh well, what am I going to say?" But as I say, there's lots more to come.

I was just thinking there are some people... there are the Bevins, and Mark Tickell. I see Paul Winters is doing his own thing. But there are more people, I'm sure, that would contribute.

Thank you so much. We'd love to hear their stories. It's very helpful of you to be so willing and open-hearted to share these.

It's just so enjoyable to do so.

Thank you.
