Jai Shri Mataji. Jim and Hilary, thank you for joining us this evening to share your precious golden memories with Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi. If I could request you to start with your seeking journey. Where were you and what were you doing when you were looking for truth? And when you met Mother, could you please talk about it? Jim, if you'd like to start, please.

Yeah, sure. We had spent about a year and a half in the Indian subcontinent, including two trips up into the Himalayas—one to the base camp and then one on the other side up to Annapurna. It was in India, really, that our seeking solidified, you might say, and became the only thing that we were looking for, although we spent a lot of time as tourists. But we gained a lot of knowledge about the system, especially at a temple called Meenakshi Temple in Madurai. There was an extensive museum there and it explained all about Kundalini and chakras and had pictures of all the saints and everything. So we had that basic understanding of it.

As we were traveling, we met a Canadian couple. The first time we met them was in Fiji. The second time was in New Zealand. The third time was in Indonesia. And another couple of times in India. The fifth time was quite remarkable. We were on a houseboat in Kashmir. As we were sitting at the table, we looked out—we were located on the bank, not out in the Dal Lake. So on the bund, as it's called, we were sitting there and looked out, and on the gangplank, walking up was this Canadian couple. We had never exchanged addresses or told each other where we were going or what we were going to do. All five times we met them was clearly by chance, so-called. Eventually, they ended up in Cambridge, remarkably.

The fifth time in Kashmir, we did exchange addresses. I kept in contact, we sent some postcards, and we sort of kept in contact. Then eventually, he ended up in Cambridge. They were from Canada.

Interviewer: If I could just ask what year that was, the time of the year, and how old were you guys? Because this kind of sounds like what kids still do, the gap year travel. Was it something akin to it or different?

We started in San Francisco, went to Los Angeles, then to Tahiti, and spent about seven months in the South Pacific, and then continued traveling. The last time we saw them in Kashmir would have been in probably 1977. We would have been in our early 30s.

So that's how we ended up in Cambridge. Like I said, we had this knowledge of Kundalini. We had actually read a book by a false guru, but it was entitled Kundalini. It was quite frightful, actually. I don't recommend it to anyone. But it kind of set the tone that if that was real, and that was what we had to go through, that we were willing to do it. But it was obviously the wrong path.

Anyway, then we got to Cambridge. I got a job with that same fellow, working on the M11 motorway, building the motorway. I stayed with him for a while, and then eventually a house became available at 59 Sturton Street in Cambridge—about 460 square feet, a two-up, two-down terrace house. So then Hilary came down, and I continued working on the motorway.

Unbeknownst to me... yes. So I was avidly seeking and tried a few things when we came back to England from our tour. But none of them worked out; it wasn't what I was looking for. Although some of the signs were there, like, "You're going to meet someone," or, "Don't read so many books anymore, you're going to find out what you want."

Eventually, I was looking through the local newspaper that used to come through the door, advertising things like rummage sales. Because we were very poor, we lived in this rented house, and I was just looking for something to put in it. And there it said, "Kundalini Awakening," and a phone number. I went, okay. So I called and I spoke to this lady called Anna, who lived in Waterbeach, about five miles from Cambridge. We set a time to meet, and I took the bus out there.

She met me at the door and, during that afternoon, she told me all about Sahaja Yoga. I was a little bit scared because of what Jim said, the book we'd read. So I wasn't sure what I was in for. But eventually, she sat me down in front of a picture of Shri Mataji. And actually, next to the picture of Shri Mataji was Jesus. Now, I wasn't an avid Christian, never went to church, but I was brought up knowing about Jesus, and it actually gave me a feeling of comfort.

So I sat there, and she stood behind me and she worked on me. And then eventually, she said, "What are you feeling?" And I was feeling this cool breeze on my hands. I thought, well, that's a really strange thing. I don't know how I'm going to tell her this. But she said, "Oh, that's great! That's what you should be feeling."

After that, she gave me the little pink photograph of Shri Mataji, the original picture, and nothing much else. She said, "Shri Mataji is in India right now. But I'll let you know when she comes back from India, and she'll be giving a meeting at Caxton Hall." So I said, "All right." I came back on the bus to my house and didn't tell Jim, because really, being a man, he was looking for a male guru, not a lady. I put this picture very carefully in a book.

Then I got a little bit sidetracked because Jim's parents came from America for about a month to tour Scotland, Ireland, England, and so on. But I remember taking the picture with me inside a book. Then Anna called me and said, "Shri Mataji is back in England. There will be a meeting at Caxton Hall at so-and-so time." So I thought, okay, I'm going to tell Jim. I showed him the picture of Shri Mataji, and I said, "I want to go and see this lady in London. And I don't want to seek anymore until I see her. Would you be interested?" And he said, "Yes." And so then we went down to Caxton Hall and met Shri Mataji.

Interviewer: Wow. So what was that first meeting with Shri Mataji like? I mean, first of all, you have this anticipation or the expectation that traditionally a guru is a male, and there's Shri Mataji. So, being human, we have our sort of expectations and preconceived ideas. What was your first meeting with Shri Mataji at Caxton Hall like? And when was it?

We went into the hall and Anna was there. She said, "Sit in the front row, because then you can see better and hear better and Shri Mataji can put attention on you." I wasn't the type of person that liked anyone putting attention on me, but I complied with Anna. So we sat there and I looked around, and slowly the hall started to fill up. People very much not like me, I thought at the time. At the time, I was a hippie, really. I had very long hair, a long beard, and all that. And the people I was looking at behind me were all dressed in suits and just didn't look like me at all. They didn't look like seekers to me. This was my state of mind at the time.

But then Douglas Frye came onto the stage with a boombox and he played some music from Ali Akbar Khan, who I was familiar with. So that was pleasant. I said, okay, I'm going to ignore all these people and just sit and meditate. So I did. And I had a very, very deep, peaceful meditation. There was a photograph of Shri Mataji on the chair on the stage. So it started to fall into place.

Then Gavin Brown came up to the microphone and he said, "I'd like to offer a little introduction before Shri Mataji comes," which he did. My initial reaction, again, was, this guy's in a three-piece suit, what does he know? I was really impressed and amazed. I can remember consciously thinking, wow, this guy. And I knew that he wasn't just talking. I knew that he knew, if you know what I mean. And so I said, if this is just the guy that's introducing her, what must she be like?

She came on the stage. The first thing she said was, "I bow to all the seekers of truth." And I thought, wow, that's me. What message is she going to give? And the message she gave, it was like answering every question I had ever had or was having at the time about spirituality and seeking and the different religions and incarnations and all of that. She explained it very simply and very succinctly.

Then the talk ended and she asked some of the Sahaja Yogis to go down and work on people. Douglas Frye was the one who worked on me, and Felicity was with him. I was having a very nice meditation until Douglas said, "What are you feeling?" And my thought was, I'm feeling fine until you interrupted me. But then he said, "Oh, okay." And then I meditated some more. And then he said, "Do you smoke?" Of course, I smoked all kinds of things, so I didn't want to admit it because I was very paranoid in those days. So I said, "No." And he said, "Hmm, that's very interesting." He said it just like that, so that I knew that he knew that I was lying.

At the same time, the left side of my neck started to get red hot. It got hotter and hotter and hotter. And then I heard him say something odd. "Now it's better." And it was. It started to cool and got cooler and cooler. Then I think Shri Mataji motioned to Hilary to feel the top of my head. She did. And what did you feel?

Hilary: I felt it very cool. And it was more verifying for me to feel it on top of somebody else's head than my own. I found that to be the case even now with people. When you ask them to feel it on somebody else's head other than their own, for some reason, it resonates more with them. All I remember at the end of Shri Mataji's lecture was she said, "You will not be thinking now." And I realized, I'm not thinking.

Interviewer: That's remarkable. You had achieved thoughtless awareness just like that. You didn't realize you weren't thinking until she mentioned it. Amazing. A very beautiful meeting with the Adi Shakti herself.

It was the answer. It's just thoughtless. It's that silence and the joy. It was what we were looking for. Almost dumbfounded that we found it. It took a while to process that we had found it, because we'd been looking in so many directions and had gone to so many false gurus and ashrams in Haridwar, Rishikesh, Lakshman Jhula, and those places. We had been to a lot of people and had checked them all off the list. We were going to check this off the list and then move on to a Zen Buddhist retreat. But we couldn't check it off. It checked us off.

Interviewer: Oh, wow. Amazing experience that you sort of had your list of things to check out, and then Sahaja Yoga or Shri Mataji found you, like the pearls scattered all over this beach to be her children as Sahaja Yogis. What was it like being in her company after your realization?

Well, I think we went to Dollis Hill. Shri Mataji used to come there on a Sunday. I remember that she worked on both of us the first time we went there. I asked Mother, "What should I do now that we have realization?" And she said to me, "Well, you wanted to save the world, isn't it?" And at that point, it was like thoughtlessness. There was nothing more to say. I think she also said, "You have the light now. And what do you do with the light? You give that light to others." That kind of went hand in hand with the fact that Hilary had actually said we want to save the world, we want to change the world. And that was the attitude in those days in the '60s. The good part of the hippie movement was that people wanted to change for the better.

So that was nice. And she worked on both of us. After that, one of the yoginis came with a plate of food. It was time to eat. So the first lady that came, I said, "Oh, thank you very much, but I'm vegetarian," because it was a chicken curry. She said, "Oh," and then she went away. Then another yogini came with probably the same plate. And I said, "Oh, thank you very much, but I'm vegetarian." Shri Mataji saw this, and she said, "Jim, why aren't you eating?" And I said, "Well, I'm vegetarian, Shri Mataji." She said, "Well, yes, but I made it." I said, "I'll have that." So, twelve years of vegetarianism, that was it.

The third time I think we met Shri Mataji was the Advent Sunday, the Guru Puja, where she declared who she is. After that, it answered every question, every seeking, every yearning you ever had. When she said that, that was like the icing on the top of everything.

When you say how was it when you were with Shri Mataji, it was like being in bubble wrap. You felt so secure, so protected, so loved beyond any other person you'd ever met. She kept you in that bubble. The protocol of the goddess... I mean, we were so far away from that. She allowed us to be that way in order to cleanse us and keep us. It was amazing.

After the declaration, there were two people there. There was Shri Mataji, the Mother, and then when she made the declaration, there was the Goddess. If you listen to that, she's in a different space. She's in a different voice, a different power. It's really remarkable. After that, there was Grégoire's book signing, and she gave us all copies and signed our personal copies. So that was pretty extraordinary as well. That was December 2nd, 1979.

Interviewer: Tell us something about the transformation on a day-to-day basis that you felt after your realization.

After I got my realization at Caxton Hall, we went home. I shaved my beard, I cut my hair. I actually had some marijuana plants growing in the back garden that I uprooted and gave to someone I knew at the health food store that we used to work at part-time. And he was so impressed that I had done that, that he threw them away and got his realization. So that was the start.

In fact, that was why that interview in Cambridge with the BBC took the tone that it did. Because the interviewer came up to me and said, "Tell me something about this Shri Mataji. What has she done for you in your life?" And I just said what I just told you. As soon as I met her, I knew it was the truth, and I knew that this was my guru. And I went home and shaved and did all those things, neatened up, and foreswore all kinds of alcohol, drugs, anything that I had been doing before. I have never, since that day, tried again. So she said, "Oh, really? Well, what kind of drugs were you into?" And I gave her a list. As reporters are, that was the type of thing people want to hear. And it was sensational. So that's how she led the interview. But yeah, that was the transformation for me. And then I read The Advent in one sitting.

Interviewer: And what was it like for you, Hilary?

Well, at that time I think I was working at the health food shop, by the name of Arjuna, which is kind of interesting since we came to the land of Krishna afterwards. It was a co-op, and there were sixteen members. And it was called Arjuna. And they were all seekers. We started doing programs in Cambridge almost immediately.

Interviewer: What was it like having the public programs in a city like Cambridge, which is kind of, you know, people are very busy in their own state of affairs?

What happened was there was a fellow, an Irishman living in London, who came to Cambridge to do a course at the technical college. His name was Don Devine. He gave self-realization to the lady that Hilary got it from, Anna. At about the same time, there was a fellow called Ian Lewis, who was from Cambridge but had been living in London. I assume he got his realization in London. So he came up and got a job at the cafeteria of Addenbrooke's Hospital. His best friend was working there as well, as well as some other people. So he gave self-realization to his best friend, who was Luis Perez Salas. And then the two of them gave realization to their two girlfriends at the time, who they later married, as well as several relatives. Luis's good friend was called Gerardo Belle. And then the two of them gave realization to Gerardo's sister and another couple called Rodrigo and Wendy. So that's pretty much how it started. And then Hilary and I came. And then quite a few people, obviously, started getting self-realization and the collective built. We first started meeting at the Methodist church. And ironically, that's where Shri Mataji had her second program, because her first program was arranged by Arnaud de Kalbermatten, when he and his future wife, Maria Amelia, were studying English in Cambridge. He actually arranged a program and Shri Mataji came. According to them, nothing much happened after that. So that was the original beginning.

Interviewer: There is a picnic in Paris with Shri Mataji and there's also your first India tour. Which came first?

I think the India tour was '80-'81. And I think the picnic was '81, later on in '81.

Interviewer: Would you like to share with us your India tour? I mean, India wasn't an unfamiliar place for you guys. How was this India tour different from when you were there before?

Well, we were with Shri Mataji. Every day for nine weeks. There were about 30 of us, between 30 and 40. Mostly Australians, but there were probably about eight or ten of us from England as well.

It was an incredible tour. One thing that stood out... you've probably seen the photograph where she's sitting on a stage, cross-legged, and there are rays coming towards her like a rainbow almost. If you've seen the whole series of those photographs, eventually she puts her hands up and in the next photo, there are no rays coming. She explained that to us—that there was a Muslim saint buried nearby and that he wanted to offer her something. That was all he could offer. But finally she put her hand up and said, "Enough, enough." So that was one extraordinary thing.

Another incident was in a place, and I'm not sure I have the pronunciation right, but called Kadus. She gave a program and it was like what a former Christian might envision Christ with the multitudes, the Sermon on the Mount or something. There were people everywhere. They were sitting on fences, sitting on the ruins of old temples. After the program, she—well, during the program, and this we learned later as well—she had told the people, "I know this guru has come to your village and he's given you all these black leather straps and you've got them around your neck. And that's why the Vishuddhi is so negative. I want you all to take these straps off and burn them and get rid of them."

Most of the talk was in Marathi. And then she also said, "By the way, I know it's a big drought here. I know that's your main concern. And if this guru is so special, let him try and stop the rain I'm going to bring as soon as the program is over." There wasn't a cloud in the sky when the program was going on. So the program's over. She comes down from the stage. Those of us on the tour, the Westerners, formed a circle around her because there were literally thousands of people who would want to come up and touch her feet. We formed a ring around her and went all the way to the car. I opened the door for her, she got in the car, and the first drop of rain hit the top of the car. We all got drenched and the people were rejoicing. The next thing we saw was a big bonfire and all of these leather black strings were going into it. It was incredible.

Interviewer: The picnic in Paris, was it when you came back to England?

Yes, it was in 1981, I think. It was one of the first programs in Paris. Actually, I wasn't sure whether I should go or not. Then I checked on the vibrations and it was one of the coolest times I'd felt about whether I should do something. So there were about seven or eight of us. We had a van, and for some reason, I was the only one who could drive it. We found out that we'd be following Shri Mataji to Paris. So we all headed off towards the English Channel. If I remember rightly, we went on a hovercraft.

Before we got to Paris, Shri Mataji decided that we needed to have a picnic. We went into a local supermarket there and bought all the things that were necessary. It was so joyful. We were there in nature, and I remember thinking, I'll pick some flowers for Shri Mataji. The only thing was some humble dandelions, but I picked them and had this big bunch. I gave them to Shri Mataji, and it was so joyful. It was like being a child, just giving your mother some flowers. And she was very gracious, of course, and accepted them.

I'll tell you an amusing little thing that happened on the way. You know how in England you drive on the left? And in France, they drive on the right. So we get to this roundabout, and we're following Shri Mataji, right? And we're going around the roundabout as if we're in England. We're going left to right, left to right. And we're following, going around and around and around. Okay, we're going the wrong way, but Mother's obviously working something out. Then we proceed on.

During our time in Paris, Shri Mataji organized for us to have a picnic, the one you're seeing in the photo. We stayed in Marie's apartment there, and Shri Mataji was there as well. Some people slept in the same room as her. It was a very wonderful time.

Interviewer: What was it like every day, waking up with Shri Mataji, probably in her house?

It's like Jim said, you were in a bubble. You would just be waiting for her to wake up and then what she would say and what she was wanting to do. It was just so exciting and wonderful. You were just home and you didn't think about anything else. You were just in the moment there with her.

Interviewer: There's a couple of stories you might like to share. You know, when Shri Mataji did the TV interview, but also when she met the scholar of Sanskrit and Pali, who was realized.

I would love to. I would recommend anyone... I asked him once, "Is there anything you're working on now? Any new text or translation?" All he said was, "Everything I have ever wanted to say is in the introduction to the Upanishads." And so I would recommend anyone to read that. Especially for Western seekers or Christian-oriented seekers, but really for anyone, how he weaves the different religions into one thing, using one example to explain another, using a page from the Bible to explain what Krishna was saying. It's remarkable.

This would have been 1984. We had arranged the program in Cambridge on the night, and we had arranged for the BBC interview in the morning. After the interview, Shri Mataji wanted to come back to the house. So we came back. She went upstairs to our little 450-square-foot house and she wanted to take a nap. She went into the bed and then she called for me to go upstairs. I went up and she wanted me to rub her feet because they were very hot. I must say, her feet were very warm when I first started rubbing them, and within five minutes they had gone completely cool. I went thoughtless as I was rubbing her feet. It was a tremendous experience. You were in a different dimension.

Downstairs, we heard that you should never wake Shri Mataji. No matter what the agenda is or a plane to catch, you never wake Shri Mataji. So we didn't. I had a watch in those days and I was looking at my watch and going, "Oh no," because we had scheduled the meeting with Juan Mascaró. On top of that, we had a program in Norwich, 60 miles away, as well that evening. So I was thinking there was just no way we were going to get it all in.

When she woke, she said, "Oh, I slept so well. But it must be a bit late, isn't it?" And I said, "Yes, Shri Mataji. I don't think there'll be time to go and see Juan Mascaró." She said, "Oh, what a shame. You better go and phone him then." Which I did. I must say, I was so disappointed. And he was as well. You could tell over the phone he was very disappointed. He said, "Oh, well, maybe another time."

I went back to Shri Mataji and told her what he said. She said, "You better go and phone him back. After all, he's an older man. We'll go and see him." And we did. He lived in Comberton, about 10 miles from Cambridge. He met her at the door of his simple thatch cottage with a white rose that he had picked from his garden. He held this rose in both hands while he sang the whole Sanskrit prayer. Can you imagine? The Sahaja Yogis were just standing back in amazement watching this. Not only did he do that, but it exhibited the fact that he believed in her.

They went inside. They sat by his fireplace where he burned peat to keep warm. And he said, "No, no, no," and he sat on the floor and offered Shri Mataji the seat. They talked and talked, and the vibrations were incredible. Really incredible. We had been to a lecture of his, Hilary and I and Don Devine, maybe a year prior, where we had seen the aura, the halo around him. It was unmistakable.

After we left, we got in the car, and I thought for sure we were not going to get to Norwich in time for this program. We must have been there for hours. On the way, she turned back to us and said, "You know, it's very rare that such a great scholar would be a realized soul." He would have been in his early 80s, I would say. The most honestly humble man.

Needless to say, we did get to Norwich on time. Just as the clock struck seven, which was the time we were supposed to be there, I went around to open the door for Shri Mataji, and the clock tower started chiming seven times. She looked up and she said, "How many times have I told you people we're beyond time?" She laughed.

There was another story. We were on the train. Shri Mataji and Roxanna were in one seat, and Hilary and I were in the other, facing each other. She was looking out and saying, "That's the thing about England. Look how green it is. Look how fat the cows are." We were laughing. I had this burning desire to ask her a question, but I knew you didn't ask Shri Mataji questions. Finally, I couldn't take it anymore. I said, "Shri Mataji, may I ask you a question, please?" She said, "Yes, it'll be all right."

I said, "Shri Mataji, was Christ in England?" I was expecting her to give an answer. Instead, she just pointed to my palms. We were sitting there with our hands on our laps, palms up. She just pointed to my palms and said, "See the vibrations." And I've never had stronger vibrations than that day. It was so overwhelming. That was the answer. But she said, "Don't tell the English that." She said it very seriously. "But don't tell the English." Then she laughed.

Interviewer: There was an instance of the goblin. Would you like to share that, please?

It started in a public program in Cambridge. This fellow, I'll call him Clive, had been involved in a false guru. It was called EST. The way he explained it was really sinister. He said they only meditated in the dark. He himself felt that it was very sinister, but he was in it. He came to our program and got his realization. I told him about Shri Mataji and asked if he'd like to go down and meet her. So we went together on the train.

We got to the program, and I worked on him. I could not clear his left Vishuddhi to save my life. My left Vishuddhi was getting really caught up as well. At the end of the program, when Shri Mataji was leaving, we were walking down the stairway at Hampstead Town Hall. For some reason, Hilary and I and this fellow Clive and Shri Mataji were the only ones on the stairway. She was in front of us. She turned around, looked straight at Clive, and she said, "You get out of here right now. I'm not kidding. Get out of here. You don't belong here. Get out."

Can you imagine? We continued on, went downstairs, and she got in her car and left. Then I turned to Clive and said, "Look, I don't know what to say." He said, "No, you don't have to explain a thing. For the entire program, this goblin," is what he called it, "was sitting on my left shoulder. And it was very menacing. I couldn't get rid of it until she said, 'Get out.' And it got out." We never saw him again.

Interviewer: What would your advice be for the seekers in the future?

Well, I think just to follow what Shri Mataji always says: to meditate. To get into thoughtless awareness for whatever amount of time that is. I think she always emphasized that over and over again—just meditate. That is the most important connection with Shri Mataji, isn't it? If you don't make that, then all the other things that you do...

Interviewer: This has been very, very good, Jim and Hilary. It's just such a delight and joy to listen to Shri Mataji's stories and the time you spent with her. We don't find the words adequate to express our love and gratitude for Shri Mataji. Thank you so much for your time today.

Thank you.
