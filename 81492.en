He brought his mentor along. Do you remember Jacques? We didn't meet him.

Anyway, there was this French guy, a big, sort of burly French guy, and he was another faith healer. One thing that really hit me and made me think was when he went and spoke to Shri Mataji and met her. When he left, he said to everyone, "You people do not realize how great she is." So he was selling Shri Mataji as the goddess. And we knew, as I say, that she was really great. But like I said, at that early stage, we weren't really prepared to accept it. Anyway, that's just one of the interesting things that happened.

Did you have any experience other than just feeling that you knew she was a goddess?

Well, everything changed. Everything completely changed. We had been trying to seek through drugs, and I tried to go to India, but luckily I had turned back. I'm so grateful for that because I think I would have gotten lost on the way there. And that was literally a few weeks before I met Shri Mataji.

Everything changed. What happened with Shri Mataji became completely normal, and everything else became slightly unreal. I felt, literally, like the earth was this huge, powerful force, and that mankind and the concrete was a very thin layer on the top, thinking that they're in some way in charge. You just felt from Shri Mataji that she was everything. I can remember that first meeting when she told us which finger related to each chakra. At that point, I felt that she had decided that minute which one it was. And if she then changed her mind, it would change. Because...

What were your experiences internally, physically, viscerally, in the first few days? Bodily, I'm saying. Were you experiencing vibrations? Were you experiencing clarity of mind? Just a little bit on the physical, mental side.

I was just pinned in bliss. There was no mental or anything like that. I was protected in this bubble. She just put me there. And it's beyond words to say what it was.

We were pretty useless and didn't meditate; we didn't know about meditation. We had a picture of Mother that we pinned on the wall, a black and white photocopy. Pat and I, obviously, as brother and sister, were very close, and it made us even closer. I had watched Pat disintegrate before my eyes before we met Shri Mataji. And, if you like, one of the greatest miracles was her giving me him back, because he was on a deadly course.

We stuck together and helped each other, but by drinking tea and eating ice cream. Yeah, we did a lot of that. We weren't very subtle. I mean, Tony is the one who had an altar and took it seriously, and he thought we were completely useless. But she just pinned me in this place where that was real. And you didn't know that it was different. It had been like that, and suddenly I was in this place. We were still mixing with hippies. Well, I was still mixing with all sorts of things. It took me a few weeks to decide exactly what was what.

But I was up and down like a yo-yo; I wasn't pinned anywhere. You were on your way to oblivion. I was. I was in a terrible state, but I was also quite open to all kinds of things. Probably one of the most powerful experiences I had was when I suddenly saw that every time Shri Mataji looked at someone, a stream of beautiful, beautiful colored vibrations would shoot out of her forehead in really rapid bursts towards each person. It was like seeing super science fiction or something. It was frightening in a way—wonderful, but frightening. And she immediately turned to me and said, "Agnya is open. You have no authority." And it stopped it dead.

But it kept happening, all these things. I kept seeing and having all these... I knew something amazing was going on, and I knew that she was something very great. I just couldn't believe someone like that existed in the world. That was my feeling. And I could see that what she was starting to teach us had the beginnings of the answer to everything we'd been looking for. I could see that she was relating all the chakras, all the incarnations, all the aspects of the divine to the subtle system. I could see that it was all coming together. But I was in such a bad state and so stunned by all of it that it took a while to integrate it and let it settle down. And I think that's the process that goes on and on and on, isn't it?

Indeed, yeah. Really. But I had quite a lot of powerful experiences. To be honest, I think I would have had some kind of a gut reaction because I immediately went back to being more, feeling more like I had when I was younger, the way I used to be. And I'm sure I would have felt something. Maybe not in such glorious technicolor, but I think I would have really felt something special, definitely.

We had some interesting times as well with your lad, with Kevin. Kevin was seven when you came. Seven. And he taught us some interesting things. Mother said he was born-realised. He was our first experience of a born-realised child. She said he was her vice-chancellor, do you remember? Yeah, yeah. And he showed us that it was the attention that does the work because the vibrations travel through your attention as well.

I remember one rather amusing incident when we were working on somebody. We couldn't get something to work out because we were trying to do something with this lad there. We said to Kevin, "Could you come and give us a hand?" And he had an electric toy with an electric propeller on it. And he just said, "Oh," and he went... and it worked out. But what he was showing us was that it was his attention that was doing it, not because his attention was on what he was doing. He was showing us, basically, that it is the attention that carries vibrations.

In those early days, did you...
