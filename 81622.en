 (England)
I had been a real intellectual, reading loads of books and studying. I was a seeker, obviously. And so was my brother, Gregoire, but we were seeking in different directions. At some point, he was in Nepal, and I had just given up finding what I was looking for. So I got married and had children—two beautiful children. I wrote to my brother saying, "Do you have something to bring to us? You are in Nepal. What are you doing there?"

He wrote back to me and said, "I have two born-realized children." And I said, "Well, that's another story of my brother. What does that mean?" Because he had done so many things in his life. I said, "Well, come and tell us what you mean by that and maybe other things."

So he came back that year. I got my realization in 1978. He came for Christmas, which was still '77, and came to the family—my parents, et cetera—and then started to talk about things. But he just said to me, "You wouldn't understand because you are such an intellectual, Antoinette." So I said, "OK."

But he was talking about a certain lady to my brothers and sister and to some friends. I said, "Who is he talking about?" Funnily enough, when he was talking, my Agnya was moving. I just didn't take notice, but it was quite strange. After Christmas, we went back to my flat in Gento, near Geneva, and I was observing him because I was a very great skeptic about spirituality. I had given up on the Catholic Church. I had been seeking in politics, in books, psychology, all of that. So he came, and I just observed him. He was playing with my little boy, who was then about four. And I said, "Gosh, this boy has completely changed. He's completely transformed."

I got really interested because my conclusion in my seeking was that there is no revolution unless and until man changes himself, and there is an inner transformation. And I left it there. So when I saw him, I said, "Oh my God, there's something happening with my brother there." I said to him, "Gregoire, how did you regain your innocence?"

At that point, he said, "Do you want to know?" He was very clever because he didn't want to talk to me intellectually about anything. He just brought this beautiful black and white picture of Shri Mataji, made me sit, and didn't say anything. Just said, "Put your hands towards this photograph." And he just raised my Kundalini, which I didn't know what he was doing, obviously. But I just felt this wonderful cool wind in my hands, a lot of joy in my heart. Peace. It was just a lovely experience.

Then I looked at myself in the mirror afterwards. I put on a blue scarf, and my eyes were completely shiny. It was just unbelievable. I said, "My God, what happened there?" Then he left for London. Didn't say anything more. I started to meditate; he left me with this photograph of Shri Mataji, and I had some really quite strong meditations. It was beautiful.

I have an account of it here. It's quite powerful, so I don't know if you want me to read it. Yes, it's a short account, but it would be very nice. I want to read it because I think that nowadays, maybe we forget a bit how it was when Shri Mataji was with us. It was so magnetic, so incredibly intense and powerful. We were in a battle, of course. Other people didn't understand, but She was protecting us. And She was giving us experiences for us to believe, because we were in a foreign world, weren't we? Now I think it's easier for people. They just come in. So, I'm a bit shy reading this, but it was a gift just after my realization. I wrote it, but oh God, it's in French, so I have to translate it. Then I will tell you about my account of Shri Mataji, if it is not too long.

"My beloved brother Gregoire, I didn't think I would write to you so soon, but I was really very keen to communicate with you. Since you left for London—he was going to see Shri Mataji there—after having left the message with me, something has happened, an event, which I can't keep quiet about. There's only one hour before I have to go and give my course at the university, so I will tell you now. I meditated for some minutes, morning and evening, on Wednesday and Thursday. And it was good. My whole day was very calm. My work was good and done with joy.

When I came back from my courses yesterday night at 6 o'clock, which was the 18th of January, 1978, I was rather tired and I was suffering from back pain. It is there on my liver that I normally feel my tiredness. I had no idea about chakras at that time. So I kind of lay on my back, on my bed. I had put a little altar of Shri Mataji next to our bed—I was married at the time with my first husband—and there was a photo of Shri Mataji, black and white, with a candle. I directed my hands towards Her, but my back was so painful that all my attention was sucked into this pain. So I just lay there. My head—my Sahasrara, though I didn't know the Sahasrara—and my hands were towards Shri Mataji's photograph with the candle there.

I stayed there, and my breathing was regular; I was breathing deeply. The vibrations were circulating in my hands, in the middle, and they were very regular. I felt very calm. Gradually, my back didn't ache anymore at all. It is in this kind of state of receptivity that I gently got up and sat in this state of calm. I sat in front of Shri Mataji with my bare feet flat on the ground and my hands towards Mother, in a state of 'disponibilité,' without any tension.

And it is then that it happened. My spirit, independent of a consciousness which was opening in myself—the mind could watch it. It was lucid and could grasp what was happening, which was extraordinary. At once, suddenly, the chair became completely enlightened. There was a kind of electric blue light, a blue and white cloud surrounding the chair and the photo of Shri Mataji, which started to become alive in this golden light. Myself, I felt like diving into a kind of golden bath. There were golden rays of light passing in front of me, in which I was also engulfed, as if they were actually passing through me. I just heard myself saying, 'Oh my God, oh my God.' And I felt like a little girl, completely astonished and bewildered, in a kind of ravishing state. I was not afraid at all. I was obviously astonished by the phenomenon.

So I wanted to get out of it, and I got out of this marvelous water without any difficulty. My mind wanted to see what was going on. But a few seconds after, again, I stretched my hands towards Shri Mataji, and there it was, incredible. My eyes were open and fixed on Her without my eyelids moving. The face of Shri Mataji seemed to disappear in these waves of gold and then to reappear. Then I saw that this face of Hers was changing, and I got into a state which was deeper and deeper. A kind of crazy shower happened in my head.

The face of Mataji was beautiful and good, like it is on the photo. But then Her expression changed: still as sweet, but also pensive or sad. And then, again, very beautiful. But behind Her, or through Her, a kind of Buddha. And then I thought I could also recognize the picture of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Later on, I knew it was the Agnya Chakra. The words on paper are very poor, my brother, and I write to you in a gush. I have seen, felt, experienced. It's so out of this world that I'm actually left without reaction.

Towards the end of this ecstasy, I was thinking, 'Oh my goodness, my husband, Edward, is going to come. I have to go and prepare his dinner.' That was very simple. And I thought I could stay there in this state for hours, in this contemplation. My hands were in a kind of very fresh breeze, and the vibrations were living; they were palpitating in my hands. But my consciousness was in a place where time is abolished. I was absolutely very aware that it was nearly 7 o'clock in the evening and I had to cook.

So I emerged out of this wave of vibration and started to prepare dinner with a sensation in my head that my brain matter had gone out of a complete 'engourdissement'—it's like when a leg has been dead or something. It was completely alive. It's like an organ which had not been working for a long time, but it was a very pleasurable sensation. It was like I was doing my first steps in a new life.

The rest of the evening was spent with a nice dinner, but I was dying to go to bed and read the first chapter of 'The Advent' that my brother was writing at the time, because I wanted to know who was in my life. Can you imagine? I didn't know at all. I was in your chapter at the stage of the history of Western thought, but I flicked through all the pages because I wanted to see the chapter where you met Shri Mataji. Needless to say, I lived with you these pages where you encountered Her. And when you say what happened to you at that moment at Her place in Surrey, in England, I was not astonished. On the contrary, I was even more... I was relieved, somehow. Because I had just lived something which was very similar hours before I was reading you. I have only one regret: that I can't talk to you just now and I can't meet brothers and sisters of this experience. I couldn't talk to my husband; I'd be dead. He's not yet receptive. Everyone has his path, and I respect it infinitely. Beloved freedom."

Okay, that's it. Just briefly, I will tell you about my encounter with Shri Mataji. It was very informal because She was in Geneva in March 1978. She was in Geneva with her husband for a diplomatic visit, so it was not a program or anything like that. Very genuinely, I just invited Her for tea at my little house... I mean, my little flat. She came to see me and the children, and my brother was there. I greeted Her, and I remember Her coming to the door and I said, "Oh, Mother, you look so young." That's how I greeted Her. She said to me, "I take care of myself. That's why I look young."

That was my first words. Then She looked at my children who were still very small, and they were jumping up and down on the sofa, playing hide-and-seek with cushions and laughing with joy, looking at Shri Mataji. They were like little angels hiding behind clouds. And She said, "They look so innocent. And they know who I am." So I was witnessing all that.

Then I asked Her if I could sit next to Her on the sofa, and I asked Her something about the apostles because I was still very much linked with Christianity and Christ at the time. I remember that She answered, "Only the youngest," meaning, I interpreted, that only St. John had understood what Christ had taught. Because I wanted to know how the apostles had understood Christ, and She said, "Only the youngest."

Then I said to Her, "Mataji"—because we used to call her Mataji at the time—"Mataji, I called you so much, and now you are here. Why did you take this form?" I was so moved at that point because I knew She was something incredibly special. She answered to me, "You would be afraid," because obviously She's Mahamaya. She's Kalki, isn't She? She gave me a little silver bangle that I still have.

Then, I was sitting on Her left, and She took my right hand and put it in Her ear to listen to my chakras. And like to listen to them. When She listened to the fourth one, She said, "Oh, you have a bad Agnya chakra," because I've been reading so much. And obviously I nodded, and I could feel when She was working on me that my thoughts were a turmoil in my head.

She asked me to sit on the other side, and She did the same with the left hand and listened to all the fingers in Her ear again. And again, She said that my left side had been weak, but I was steady and very deep. That's what She said. Then my husband came, and She worked on him.

The next morning, I went to visit Her at the Hotel Intercontinental. I wanted to bring Her a present, and I just found this pot of Swiss honey, which is a good honey. She said, "Oh, that's the food of the goddess." So I knew I had at least given an auspicious present. It is at that point that She said—I was sitting at Her feet—She looked at me and said, "You must now spread Sahaja Yoga."

I looked at Her with great anxiety. No, with anxiety. And I said to Her, "But You must help us." And She answered, "Of course I will." So, that was really... it was the beginnings, wasn't it?

Yes. And then also at that point, She said to me, "You have to write things down, Antoinette. Because later on, people will want to know." And so I wrote a diary from 1978 to 1986, which has a lot of stories. But that's my encounter with Her.
