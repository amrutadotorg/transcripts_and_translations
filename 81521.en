I got my realisation in Hampstead. I was first going to the meetings at the Friends Meeting House and had bumped into an old friend of mine who was helping arrange them. I duly went along on a Thursday evening, I think it was 7:30, and we all sat down in a fairly small, intimate room. There were about 20 or 30 people, not a huge room.

We sat there comfortably waiting, and I remember turning around and seeing Shri Mataji appear for the first time. She was wearing a beautiful white sari and sailed in just like a queen. I thought it was so regal; that first impression was of real royalty. The meeting carried on, and we had a very nice talk from Shri Mataji. Then I remember people being worked on, including myself. Someone was trying to raise one of my sides and put the other down, and Shri Mataji came over and said, "No, no, no, not that side. It's the other side."

Whereupon she started to work on me, and I felt this amazing force flowing up to the top of my head. After that, I can't remember much, but it was a glorious moment and a very powerful experience. I remember when I left that evening, there were people lying on the floor. It was a strange thing, stepping over bodies as if after some sort of explosion. But I carried on after that, and it was a great experience.

One of the questions that was asked in the last session was, where was your headspace? Why did you go to get your self-realisation?

I think it was because of my friend, who I had known before Sahaja Yoga. I knew they were very much into seeking and spiritual exploration, and I felt that whatever they recommended would be a good thing to go to. As a seeker, one was interested in being as open as possible to things, and this just sounded great, like the right thing.

I do remember at the time, before I got my realisation, feeling how important this was. I just suddenly felt, "This is it. This is really the truth, and one must get this right." And so it proved.
