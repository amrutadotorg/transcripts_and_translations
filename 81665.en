 (England)
The next time she actually came to Bristol was in October 1982. This was her third visit. We were seeing her at public meetings, pujas, and at her house in Brompton Square in London, but the closest we were to her generally was at these meetings.

This time, we'd had to move out of the flat in York Road where she might have been on the previous two occasions. The landlord, who lived in the basement, had gone a bit funny. We found this very nice flat in an old vicarage around the corner, very close to the other one. That was kind of miraculous in a way because we got the place, but it was unfurnished. We didn't have any housing association and we didn't have any money either, really. We went around to see it, and that's when we found it. We lived on the ground floor on the left of the door, with the room behind and the kitchen.

To the extreme left of the picture, there's a little park which used to be a graveyard. That will come into a story I'm going to tell shortly. This was the old vicarage. They built bits on over to the right; that was all new, and there were a lot of different flats. That room there on the left of the door is where she stayed. My grandfather, out of the blue, had sent a check saying he'd done rather well on the stock market. It had never happened before, so we had the money to buy furniture. We were able to get everything we needed, which was really, really fortuitous. It did seem miraculous at the time.

It just so happened, because we had to wait a long time for this housing association flat, we decided to go back to our old flat and check if there was any mail for us. The letter telling us we had this place had been delivered there quite a while before. We had literally one or two days in which we could accept the offer. We picked the letter up, and that's that.

Anyway, yes, she actually came there. We had a meeting again in Bristol, and afterwards, we had dinner there at home. I was cooking the meal. The year before, I'd also cooked when she came, and I hadn't used Basmati rice that time. She was very complimentary about my cooking. She said, "It's wonderful. You should always use Basmati rice."

This time, I was very busy because we were trying to prepare for Mother coming and I was organizing the cooking. I should say that it wasn't so easy to get Basmati rice at this time. It's very common now; you can go into any supermarket and find it. But anyway, they came back from the shop and said they didn't have Basmati rice. I felt bad because Mother had said, "Always use Basmati rice." So, I prepared the meal and then I was in the kitchen saying to Janet, "Oh, I feel awful. I should have used Basmati rice."

Then someone came through and said, "Shri Mataji is asking for you." I went into the sitting room and she said, "Ruth, where did you get this rice? This is the very best quality Basmati rice. We can't even get this in London."

So that was strange. I remember we bought it and it was in a sack; it wasn't in a sort of plastic bag. They were in big sacks, but they didn't know what it was in the shop. It was proper aged rice because the older it is, the better it is—more fragrant and flavoursome. So, unconsciously, you had unknowingly just the best rice.

After that meeting in Bristol, Mother went down from our flat to Exeter for a meeting there. In the afternoon, we had a little puja. I think Grishna and Pat had arranged it because they had a connection with Exeter people. It was very small; it was amazing. The Exeter people were Ian and Tara Bascom and a few other people around there.

So, we went down and had the puja, which was lovely. I had gone with Linda Williams and her son, Toatria, who was very small. Ruth had gone with Shri Mataji. She was talking all the way about the West Country, about how Jesus must have been around all these places and how beautiful they were. And then at some point she said, "England, Wales, and then the world." So that was also interesting, but what it meant, I don't know.

When it came time to go home, I came back with Linda and her little son, and Ruth went back with Shri Mataji. Nick Carswell was driving. I think it was Nick, Pamela Bromley, myself, and Shri Mataji in that car. The problem was that I had the only key to the flat. But that didn't seem a problem because I think we left slightly ahead of them. I realized within five minutes that I didn't have the key. Shri Mataji said, "Perhaps we should go back and see if they're still there." We went back to the meeting place, and they'd gone. And they had the key.

Meanwhile, we were driving happily along the M5 motorway up to Bristol when the car broke down. Fortunately, it was just by a service station, so we were able to take refuge there. The little boy, Toatria, was having a tantrum and just wouldn't stop crying. We called the AA, and it took a long time, and we got towed back to Bristol hours later.

Of course, we didn't have the key. I was in the car with Pamela and Nick. And of course, there were no mobile phones, so we weren't in communication. You were just stuck when things like this happened. So we were sitting outside the old vicarage with Shri Mataji in the front seat. It was about 10 o'clock, quite late at night. Every so often, she'd say, "Go and try the..." Now, I think she had some keys in her bag and said, "Go and try these keys in the door." And they didn't work.

This went on for a while. Then she fell asleep in the front seat, and she was snoring. I was thinking, "Oh, my goodness, what are we going to do? Say Shri Mataji wants to use the bathroom or something, what are we going to do?" These kinds of things were going through my head. Eventually, she woke up. This was maybe another two hours later, and they still weren't there. So she said, "Let's go and get a drink or something."

We drove around Bristol. Everywhere was shut, basically. But there was a kind of kiosk at the side of the road which was selling drinks, and so she said, "Oh, let's stop here." We had hot chocolate, I remember. And then I remember Nick saying, "But, what if you've got a bad liver, Mother? Should you have hot chocolate?" She said, "Oh, just have less milk. It's very good at night."

So we enjoyed our hot chocolate and then started driving back. I remember she was saying—because I was giving directions, and I'm not really exactly good at that sort of thing—"Goodness, you know it so well." It was just quite funny. We got back to the old vicarage again. By now, this was really late at night.

While we were going around getting the hot chocolate, my brother, Alan, had meanwhile come back. Seeing that he couldn't get in because he didn't have a key either, he thought that she must be sleeping inside and didn't want to disturb her. So he lay down in his car in the front seat and tried to sleep. In the meantime, we came back to the old vicarage again, but didn't see him because he was lying down, and we didn't see him.

Mother said, "Well, is there anywhere else we can stay?" And the funny thing was that Alan had really wanted Shri Mataji to go to the flat that he was currently living in, which was not suitable at all. We'd actually lived there before, but it wasn't suitable for Mother. It had a tiny little toilet where your knees touched the door, and there was a mattress on the floor and so on. But he really wanted her to go there. And she said, "Is there anywhere else we can go?"

So I said to Shri Mataji, "Well, there is Alan's." She said, "Let's go there." We drove to this other place, not far. Alan Richards opened the door, very surprised, in fact, covered in kumkum. It was really, really late, about two o'clock in the morning. So the irony was that Mother ended up staying there, but Alan was asleep in the front of the old vicarage and never knew anything about it.

Anyway, Mother slept in the bedroom, which was the mattress on the floor. And Pamela, Janet Ridley, and myself slept in the corridor. The carpet was just on a stone floor; it was really, really cold. In the morning, Mother said, "Can you wake me up at eight o'clock?"

At eight o'clock in the morning, Janet and I went into the bedroom. We didn't know how to wake Mother up. We thought, "What do we do?" So we just bowed down. But we were so tired, we fell asleep bowing down.

Eventually, she woke up and was saying, "What's happened?" She was enjoying that kind of drama a bit. "Now, you better go and ring Chris and see what's happened." So we had to go to a phone box; we didn't have a phone there. Then I came back and apologized to Mother. I said, "I'm so sorry, Mother, that you had to sleep on this mattress." And she said, "What are you sorry for? It's a wonderful, lovely bed."

So I had to go and tell her the whole story of what happened to Chris and Linda. And then later on, she said that the reason she was sitting in the car asleep was because of that graveyard that had been turned into a children's playground outside the old vicarage. She was clearing it. And also, she said that I was soon to have a child. And it was just after she went that I became pregnant.

The church that had belonged to the graveyard had been bombed in the war, so it had disappeared. It wasn't really obvious that it had been a graveyard. The whole thing was this beautiful Maya. It was such a Sri Krishna-type Maya. I enjoyed it so much, finding out what had happened to Chris and having to tell her.

When she went, we were all in the hall. I remember Mother was driving back to London with Nick. Janet lived in London, but she was too shy to ask Mother if she could go in the car with them. So I said—because it's easier to ask for someone else than for yourself, isn't it?—"Can Janet come back in the car with you?" And she said, "Of course, she can come back."

Then she told us how nice the meetings are in Bristol and how she liked the style we were doing them, with nice cups of tea and cakes. Janet and I had bought a stationery set for Shri Mataji, and we gave it to her. And that was it. That was the whole Maya of the old vicarage. It was very funny.

What did you cook for Shri Mataji? I think it was like a risotto. It was chicken and various vegetables and so on. The year before, it was lamb, I think. Lamb and rice.

And what would you give for dessert? Melon. I sort of did little boats with cherries, and Mother ate several of those. She said how much she liked melon. She was very nice about my cooking.

What did you serve her for breakfast? I cannot remember that. It's a bit too far. I mean, it was all... there wasn't anybody really to help. So it was just me, cooking for 30 people or something in a little kitchen. So, it was amazing, really.

And Shri Mataji was just so sweet. At the old vicarage, I remember in the morning... I slept in the bedroom with Shri Mataji. She said, "Come and sleep in the bedroom with me." And Pam was there as well, so it was Pam, me, and Shri Mataji in the bed.

The three of you in the bed? No, no, we were on the floor. Shri Mataji was on the floor. I thought I wouldn't go to sleep, and Shri Mataji started snoring. Immediately, I was asleep.

In the morning, Shri Mataji passed the bed and told me to come and sit next to her. Then she started telling me about how, "I'm always looking out for things for you to do, Ruth." She often used to talk to me about how I should have a shop, and about clothes. "Everywhere I go, I'm looking for things that you could do." Talking to me like this, it was very sweet, just so motherly. She always had her attention on me, trying to look for options, avenues for me.

Later that year, she told me—I was writing a children's book—and she said, "Yes, bring it to me. I'll bandhan it for you." It just so happened after a meeting at Caxton Hall again that year, in November. They were all saying goodbye to Mother, and someone asked me to take something, some part of a clock or something. So, I went up, and then I gave it over and said, "Oh, could you bandhan my book?" And she gave it a very vigorous, concentrated bandhan. Nothing came of that particular book, but things did come out of that in a way. So the next year, '83, the big thing for us was our first child, Lakshmi, was born. And Shri Mataji said to my brother, who was in London with her, "That's good. They can call her Lakshmi. They need some of that." Which is true.

So in 1984—there'd been a two-year gap—she came for the fourth and last time to Bristol in August. By this point, we'd had to give up our nice flat in the old vicarage due to the demands of the collective, who wanted us all to move into an ashram together. That was a bit of a wrench because we'd just got this nice little nest, and then having to go and live in the ashram, which wasn't so nice in a way. But this house was bought by Bernard's mother. Bernard was one of the people moving in with us, so it was lucky, really, that we were able to choose the house. We moved in, and there were sometimes up to eight or nine of us living there.

In August, Mother came there. I suppose everything was getting more serious in Sahaja Yoga. It was getting bigger. She'd been traveling in Europe and around the world, I guess, so there were more foreign yogis. It was getting bigger, and it was getting less easy to be close to Mother physically because there were so many demands on her time. So this last visit was very special.

One of the days she was there, we went shopping. It was very interesting. When you were with Mother, she's absolutely alive, and you feel alive. She's sort of drawing your attention to everything. We parked in one of the central parts of Bristol, where there's a lot of Victorian architecture, and she was pointing it out and saying how nice it was.

Then we went into a department store, and she was pointing at various dolls and how strange they were. One was one of those Star Wars characters, the evil emperor, I think. And she was saying how this showed the dark superconscious. She wanted to buy some plates, and we chose some. She said they were very "Bauhaus-ish," which she didn't like. But then she found some that were okay.

And she talked about Sir C.P. a bit. I remember one thing she said, which just struck me as a very interesting comment about the Goddess and how she wants us to live our lives. She said, "One can have too much sobriety." You can be too straight-laced, too serious. We need this playfulness, the ability to make mistakes, and to allow that in ourselves and other people.

She was also looking for a tie for Sir C.P., and we went around the clothing part of the department store. She was feeling all the ties. It suddenly popped into my head—it wasn't something I would normally think—but, "Oh, it would be nice if she bought me something." We walked out of that shop, and she said, "Chris, I want to buy you some shoes." So we went into a shoe shop, and she bought me a pair. Then she said, "Yes, they're good. Yes, try these on as well." She ended up buying me two pairs of shoes. It's just such a motherly generosity. I mean, one pair would have been nice, of course, but two pairs really underlined that generosity. Symbolically, I was thinking, "Golly, I've got a long way to go. I need two pairs."

The other main thing for me at that time was she gave me this talk about art. She took me into our bedroom, where she was staying, and there was just me and her. She wanted me to write this book about art. Without anything having been said, I had been trying to write just such a book, more or less, since I'd finished my postgraduate course. It was there at the back of my mind that I wanted to do this.

For about an hour, she talked about the whole history of art. I took notes; unfortunately, we didn't have any recording equipment. Do you want to read out an excerpt from your diary? Let me just try and bring it up. It's interesting, isn't it, how you and the whole family are into art. Oh, absolutely. We're all very conscious of beauty—the beauty of buildings, art, everything. Ruth's mother was a professional artist for a time, and my grandfather had an art gallery in St. James's, really near Caxton Hall, where he sold very charming nineteenth and early twentieth-century English art. Mother told me I had a good eye, so that gave me confidence that my judgments about art have some validity.

Okay, so some of the things she was saying in that talk about art, from my little notes... In the ashram, in the meditation room, she just bought this cape-like coat when we were out shopping. She was very pleased with it and she put it on, but the top button wasn't sewn on well. I just sewed the button on that, and then she was standing there having her picture taken.

She was saying how there's no love in modern art. She was talking about a particular painting by the French artist Géricault. It's an image of a horse with lightning striking and how panicky the horse looks, and that that was a good picture. She talked about the whole history, like in the Middle Ages, the images we see of women showing high foreheads with the hair straight back—and maybe even the hair shaved a little—and how this was a sign of ego developing in the West. As love goes out, art becomes a profession.

She talked about Michelangelo and Blake as her favorite artists. I said about Michelangelo, "But he wasn't exactly happy, was he?" And she said, "Who would be?" And that really struck me, because I thought, "Yeah, this world is a difficult place, and Mother understands that." And it's a very difficult place for artists who are trying to produce something that manifests "compassionate power." This phrase she used a lot at that time. She said this is what art should be doing now: expressing compassionate power.

She talked about Leonardo, how he was such a great soul, such an amazing genius, but how he got into wanting power and how he lost his sense of his value and how he killed himself. I said, "Did he? That's not in the history books." And she sort of just looked into herself and put her attention on this, and then she opened her eyes and said, "Yes, definitely. I know somehow he killed himself because he lost his sense of value." And I thought, self-worth. It's easy to lose your sense of value in this society, especially as an artist, if your work is just not recognized at all.

She talked about Tolstoy and industrial development, and how this kicks the ego even further into being. She was particularly concentrating on modern, contemporary French art, which she did not like. She repeated it, really emphasizing, "This is how..." Also, the Bauhaus, this art school that was founded by Gropius in the early '20s. That this was the climax of the attack in the West just before Mother's birth. That cultural attack.

She hasn't spoken much about the arts in particular detail in her public talks, but here I felt she was really stressing the importance of this. Both art as beautiful and compassionate, but also art as expressions of negativity. And the Bauhaus, which is most famous for modernist architecture—these big tower blocks, this dead style which I see as superconscious—which spread from Germany. The Nazis didn't like the Bauhaus, so they moved to America, and from America, it spread all around the world, this epidemic of modernist architecture, which we still live with. This was very negative. She actually really wanted me to stress that.

Then she came up with a name for the book. She was sort of running through various things: "From Art to Truth," "Art in the Light of Truth," and then she said, "Art, Love, and Truth." And for me, this was such a strong, passionate title, whereas I would have thought of something a little more cool and intellectual sounding. It really demanded a certain kind of way of writing a book. Eventually, I did write the book, Art, Love, and Truth, which took me a very, very long time.

When she was giving me that title, "Art, Love, and Truth," I could feel my Kundalini go whoosh. And she said, "Ah, your Kundalini comes up." So, I felt it would happen. It's nice to be blessed by the Adi Shakti herself. I made a small attempt to get it published through conventional publishers, but there was no interest. Very luckily, Felicity and her husband, Richard, moved to Bristol, and he helped publish it.

How did you go about researching? One gets very mental. It's difficult. I actually wrote three versions of the book. The first was more scholarly, perhaps a bit dry, and it didn't quite work. Then I wrote another version which was more about the qualities of spiritual art as I see them, like balance, inspiration, and innocence, and that was okay, but a bit half-baked. Then finally, I wrote something that I feel integrates the scholarly, research side—but not too heavy or dry—with a more passionate, spiritual aspect that I'm trying to weave in and promote.

Did Shri Mataji give you advice on writing? She did say, "Try and concentrate on one thing at a time. I have the same problem," she said, because my attention tends to get spread out to various different projects.

Another nice little thing that happened was she asked to see some photos that I had taken. They were just pictures of Ruth and our child, Lakshmi, on a holiday in Cornwall. Near where my grandmother lived, where we were staying, is a place where Jesus is said to have gone. There's a well called the Jesus Well. It's a place called Rock. And the story is that he came in a ship up the Camel estuary with his uncle, Joseph of Arimathea, who was involved with the tin mining industry. The vibrations there are amazing. Near Bristol, we've got places also with legends of stories about Jesus, up on the Mendip Hills, like Glastonbury. The old lead mines on the Mendips, which are a little way north of Glastonbury, have very similar vibrations.

Ruth, would you share with us the presents that Shri Mataji gave? This beautiful pearl necklace. And you can feel the cool. She also gave me two pairs of pearl earrings. One pair was freshwater pearls, like Sahasraras, big circles with lots of little pearls on them. She gave them to me at Shudy Camps, and I was very happy, but when I took them away, I thought, "It's a shame because I can't wear them." The posts were a metal which makes me react.

The next day, Nita, who was helping Shri Mataji at the time, came in with some real pearl earrings for me on gold posts. She said, "Mother says give Ruth these as well." And I said, "Oh, that'll go with the pearl necklace she's given me." And I was obviously very happy.

This was in 1991. Shri Mataji asked me to go down to Shudy Camps to do some sewing. While I was down there, which was an amazing time because she was just there with her family, there were only three other Sahaja Yogis there. I was taking up a lot of trousers for her relatives and Sir C.P.—I think it was 16 pairs. The other thing was to alter a jacket for Sir C.P. because he had one shoulder higher than the other. I had to lower one shoulder and still have it looking smart.

There was this amazing time when I was in Mother's room. She was sitting in her chair, Sir C.P. was standing, and I had to pin the jacket on him while Mother was just looking at me. It was just blissful. I could feel her love on me. I just did not want to leave that room. And she was saying, "A bit up, a bit down," while I was pinning.

I didn't think, "How on earth am I going to do this?" But somehow, I did it, and it came out perfectly. Except that I couldn't get the sleeve to lie properly with the lining. Nita went and told her the trouble I was having, and she said, "Just tell her to turn it inside out and iron it from the other side." I did it, and of course, it was perfect.

Nita had a sewing machine there. Imagine, Shri Mataji had said to Nita to ask me because she had some tailoring to do for Sir C.P., and I had said, "I don't do tailoring, I'm not a tailor," because I was a bit nervous. When Nita told her, she said, "Who does she think does everything?" The whole thing was a bit of a lesson in that, really. By some means, I did this incredibly complex tailoring job, not being a tailor, and it came out perfectly.

When she left Shudy Camps—it was supposed to be the last time she was leaving—we were in the hall to say goodbye. When she went past me, she said, "Bless you, bless you, bless you. I'm very pleased with you. Sir C.P. is very pleased with you. My family are very pleased with you. We're all very pleased with you."

And another miracle that happened there... I had two girls at that stage, and I was 37. In my heart, I wanted two more children. I'd seen these little twins playing in the doctor's clinic and thought, "Oh, wouldn't it be lovely to have twins." I was sitting in front of Shudy Camps, and it suddenly just rushed into my attention: "Mother, please let me have twins." And I was just covered with a shower of vibrations, really obvious. Apparently, Mother said at that time to Nita, "How many children does Ruth have now?" That week when I went back, I became pregnant almost straight away. And it was twins. It just defies belief, really.

Before we had all the children, we were asked to look after someone else's child while they went off to India. The child was quite caught up, probably because of the past of his parents who had been involved in TM. But we worked on him, and we were very firm with him, but loving. We had him for about nine months. I was two months pregnant with Lakshmi. It was good training in a way. And we heard that Mother said, "They know how to look after children in Bristol." So she was pleased.

After the end of that last visit to Bristol, she told me to write this book on art. I was thinking, "It's very difficult to get any work done in this ashram." The day after she left, my grandfather, who was the only one in the family who was well, wrote to me and said he was passing on some money, and it was enough to buy a house. It was a miracle for us, a very material miracle, but a very necessary one. So we were able to move out.

Sometime after that, Shri Mataji wanted us to move to Italy. We kept the house—this is the same house we're in now—and we moved to Italy in 1988. There was a big rented house on Lake Como called Galbiate where a few yogis lived. It was partly paid for by the collective on the basis that every weekend, about 40 or 50 people from Milan would descend on the ashram, stay there, and eat a lot there. It was a real churning of egos. Everybody who ended up there was like under a magnifying glass.

One nice thing that happened to me when we were there: I'd been writing this book about Jesus called Sophia, which eventually got published. Quite a few of the Italians started reading it in English, and they really liked it. A lot of seekers read it as well because it's very good for the left Vishuddhi, and with the strong Roman Catholicism there, they found it very soothing. One time we were back in England for a puja, and I was on a train with Shri Mataji. They called me into her compartment, and someone was telling her about this book. He started saying, "You know, it goes like this," and she said, "I know. I know everything."

While we were in Italy, I went to India. This would have been 1988. There was one very big miracle. I have suffered a lot from self-doubt. So when I was in India, there was one day in Pune where we went to a craft market. All the time at this market, I was following everyone at a distance because I didn't want Shri Mataji to put her attention straight on me.

I followed her, and eventually, I saw these silk paintings and I forgot about it all and started to buy some. When I finished, which took ages, I looked up and everyone had gone. The market was near to closing, and they'd all gone. I just relaxed and thought, "Oh, I'll just have a quick look around." As I was walking along, Shri Mataji was walking towards me. I did namaste, and she said, "How are you, Ruth?" And I said, "Very well, thank you, Mother," which was my usual reply, even if I wasn't.

She looked at me with such compassion and she said, "Just enjoy, just enjoy," and she walked past. A couple of seconds later, I looked around. She wasn't there. When I went back to the camp, I said, "I just saw Shri Mataji and she spoke to me at the market," and they said, "That's impossible because at no point was she on her own. She left with everybody." She manifested because she could feel me not thinking myself happy.

I had this really powerful dream not that long after we got married, to do with Chris's work. I was back in my childhood home in Bristol, and I was standing in the doorway. Shri Mataji was at the top of the drive, and the sun was enormous behind her head. She did namaste to me. I had a nappy bucket and I was filling it with earth. I knew in the dream that this earth was something to do with Chris's writing; I was somehow preparing something for it. And she said, "Thank you for doing this work for me."

When I look back on that, I think that was amazing, very profound. Because Ruth has had to suffer a lot through this, through my putting my attention always on this writing, which has not been in any way lucrative. And she's supported me in this. It would have been very, very difficult, if at all possible, without her.

The main thing I would want to say about Mother to people who didn't have that opportunity was this quicksilver way she had of changing from moment to moment. Sometimes she was in a very human, housewife, mother-type mood. And then, in a split second, she could become the goddess, considering some very deep problem that someone had. Also, the endless compassion. Seeing her at the early meetings, when she would come round after her talk and work on people individually and give so much attention to them.

It's been a joy talking to you, Ruth, and to you, Chris. Thank you so much. Thank you very much. It's been a delight. Thank you, Shri Mataji. Thank you, Shri Mataji, again and again.
