So, Yoga Singh told my brother, "Why don't you do Sahaja Yoga? Your sister is doing it." My brother said, "No, no, she's not doing it anymore." And he said, "Okay, but you should carry on." So he took my brother to Shri Mataji, and that's how my brother started Sahaja Yoga. They both were meeting in Montague Hall in Hounslow.

One day, he told my brother, "Due to your sister, I'm in Sahaja Yoga." When my brother mentioned it to me, I didn't remember at first. Then my brother told me, "He's the man who was doing a lot of arguments." I said, "Yes, yes, yes, I remember!" He was constant. And for me, it was very rude to talk to any elder like that. He had asked me, and I gave him his Realization. That's why Yoga Singh said, "I have an obligation to take you to Sahaja Yoga." That's how my brother also started Sahaja Yoga.

Now, my first experience of vibrations was heat. There was a meeting, and I was a little late. That day we were in a small room because a big event was going on in the main hall. Shri Mataji was sitting there, and a few people were sitting around Her on the floor in a circle. When I went in, Mataji said, "Come here. Put your both hands towards this man." I put both my hands towards that gentleman.

In my head, I thought, Shri Mataji usually asked me to put one hand towards Her and the other hand towards that gentleman. But why is she asking me to put two hands? But no questions. We were not allowed to ask why. So I said, "Okay," and I stood there. After a while, my hands started to get very hot. I thought something was wrong with me, so I just went to the washroom. I washed my hands with cold water—it was winter time—and I felt good. I came back into the hall and stood again with two hands out. Within two or three minutes, again my hands were hot. I went again. Four or five times I went back and forth, and Shri Mataji was watching me. My hands went really red.

Mataji asked me in Hindi, "What happened? What happened?" I said, "Mataji, I don't know why my hands are getting so hot." She immediately said, "Because this is a Tantrik sitting here. And now he's going to run, and he's not coming back." The gentleman got up and he ran.

Another gentleman was sitting there, and both of these men came from the Indian embassy. They were in good posts. The other gentleman started describing Shri Mataji as Mahakali. And I thought, why is this man calling Mataji Mahakali? She's Mataji, she's a woman. Mataji knew what was going on in my head. She said, "Oh, because he's possessed. That Tantrik has done something on him, so he can see me as Mahakali. And you can see me as an ordinary woman." So that was my first experience of vibrations: hot hands.

She used to ask, "Do you feel any coolness coming in your fingers?" And she used to let me hold Her feet, and that's how she used to transfer vibrations, because the chakras were not working. "If you do this, they might get activated." And when vibrations started, she said, "Now take it like this. Oh, take your hand here and feel it."

When the vibrations start, how do you feel? The boss says everybody's Sahasrara does not open completely. A few petals open that you can see. And when you close your eyes, you can see it's like rose petals—the petals of the Sahasrara. And it's opening. So it opens little by little. But when the complete Sahasrara opens, you feel your half-head is cut and it's gone. Sometimes you do not feel the top part of your head.

And when you close your eyes, you can see the light. Many times when we are doing meditation and we reach the fourth stage, it is literally like a one-thousand-voltage bulb is here and the light is coming towards your Sahasrara. It's like magnetic rays. You feel a little magnetic pull from inside you. And it is cool; it is a light, but it is a cool light. It comes from there.

Yesterday one girl came, and we were doing meditation. I think it was the day before yesterday. She just came and sat there, and she had a nice experience. Savita Didi said, "Do this," and she started doing that. Afterward, she said when she did this, it was like water pouring from her one hand to the other hand. In fact, there is no water, but that is the Kundalini energy.

And then they used to watch each other's Sahasraras, how they looked. You close your eyes, and for example, if I want to see Baal's Sahasrara, I'll put my attention, close my eyes, and I can see the picture here. Her limbic area comes here. That's how we tune to each other. Shri Mataji said through vibrations we know in the collective whose Sahasrara is open and not open.

And how does the Kundalini work when it goes up from the sushumna? How do you feel? Baal is explaining that if somebody is sitting there, through their clothes you can see something going up, like water. You make a little path, and the water is running through it. And through that watery flow, you see the chakras moving inside. They're going round, round, round. And they were practicing with small children. Even small children used to see that. It will be a game for them, but it is also work for them. They will get so excited to watch each other's Kundalini and they'll integrate with each other easily. It's the practical way, and once they've experienced it, then there's no other way.

They will learn what the chakras are. So, Baal and I will do this. We'll call the children and tell them how Kundalini works. Yes, Baal agreed that we are going to call the children.

How to make them see the Kundalini vibrations? Through practice, you can see. I did not have that vision, but to describe it, what I must see is this: if you look at me, you will look at me only up to here. If you start to raise your attention and your eyes a little higher, you will see a white line. And by practice, you will see that white line. If I raise my Kundalini more, you will see that it is rising. If I raise my attention here, you will see that a white aura is coming out. And that is your Kundalini. The aura is the Kundalini because it passes through each chakra and brings the colors of the rainbow. So, by practicing, you can see the vibrations. But we do not have the habit. Now I have a habit. I watch everyone's head to see what level the vibration has gone to.

[This is a form. Ma'am, delivery did not happen quickly. There was water for him. He came to take it. Yes, we have given him that time. We have recorded that time. Now we will say something new. It does not go to curing, it goes to medicine. But in Sahaja Yoga, there is a chakra, there is a nerve. How to work with that?]

By opening the Sahasrara, what are we benefited by? We understand chakras and everything, but why do we have to open the Sahasrara? What is the reason? If the Sahasrara opens, what are we going to benefit from?

We are connected, but there are many other things. Sometimes a little bit of the Sahasrara opens. We touch that part, and we come back, but we are not benefited much. A very little experience comes, and we get satisfied with that. So, here Shri Mataji said, "Get a little greedy." She has permitted us. At this level, get a little greedy and practice that. And also, when you reach this point, before you raise your attention higher, ask Shri Mataji, "Give me complete Sahaja Yoga." I ask Her daily, "Shri Mataji, give me complete Sahaja Yoga. Complete knowledge of Sahaja Yoga." So, if I transfer this knowledge to any soul, I give them completeness. I do not give them half-knowledge. If I am a half-baked cookie, I will create another half-baked cookie. That is not the work of Sahaja Yoga. So, we must always meditate and ask this of Mataji: "Give me completeness." While asking this, she will start to open your Sahasrara. She asks for our desire.

Collective consciousness will be like more voltage. It is an electromagnetic power. When your body gets generated more, you sometimes get a shock touching something because the power is more. So, by adding more power of the Paramchaitanya, it comes double.

At that time, we have to make sure we are sitting in a nice place and our bodies are not touching each other. Why? I will tell you. When your bodies are touching, you are meditating fine, but the next person is not meditating. They are not at that level. They take your current into their body, and they get comfort. The other body is taking your energy, and your attention is not rising. You are putting in 100% effort, but you are not benefiting. So, please, take your space and then do the collective meditation. Then, you will benefit more. Your aura has to have space to come out. Otherwise, I have noticed many people sit next to each other, and for the last person, the aura has come out from one side, but the other side has not come out. It's like somebody has made a sandwich. So, again, on that left or right side, you are not benefiting, and you might feel hot in that hand and the energy will not be flowing.

Sometimes, other bodies' currents are different, and they will penetrate our system. Long time ago, I told Shri Mataji, "Why don't you give us vision, so we can see everything and we can work it out?" And she said, "What, are you mad? Do you know, there is nothing glorifying you can see. There is horror there. Horrible, horrible things are there. If you see those things, you will get frightened." I asked her because that man was describing Mahakali, so I thought I might see something. Shri Mataji said, "It's horrible things. You will be frightened, and then you will never be able to practice Sahaja Yoga. No, vision is not good. I am not going to give vision. Work it out through your Sahasrara and everything will be worked out." Otherwise, once your Kundalini is passing through here, your vision can be opened. But certain things she has not disclosed to us. The more we practice, that awareness will tap into it. Maybe there is a pen drive system in this system. In the future, we will get the pen drive inserted, and that will be revealed.

Question: Did she tell techniques to nourish the Sahasrara as such? Because, at that point, when Shri Mataji was telling so many things, the Kundalini would be up, and there were cases where she would tie the Kundalini up. Like one yogini, she tied it for six months up there. To stop it from coming down, did she tell techniques to people that you could share, possibly?

Answer: Shri Mataji used to do that, but I don't think she has revealed that. That is, soften your pitas. Now, we are talking in two dimensions. One is the equipment on our pitas, which are the roots of the chakras. Here are the roots. This is an upside-down tree. And when the Kundalini comes up, vibrations are also coming from those pitas. So, we are trying for those roots to come out from the pitas. From one root, another root will come out. That's how it works.

By tying the Kundalini, what are we doing? The Kundalini itself is the nourishing power. It's moist. For any tree, if you sow a seed, you will make sure there is fertilizer and water. Only in a moistened place will any plant grow very healthy and nice. But if this earth is not moistened, then no seed will grow. So, by putting oil and everything, you are softening this on a physical level. You are nourishing this part of your head, so it becomes soft. The skin becomes soft. Through the skin—those pitas are in this sandwich, placed halfway in. They are not on the upper part; they are right in between. So, by softening this, the vibrations can penetrate. Because vibrations come with force. Like a water pipe, if water is coming with force and you press it with your thumb, it goes the other way. Exactly that comes here. If some points are closed, it will go to the other side. That's how it penetrates.

And that is the nurturing of your spirit. What is your spirit? Your attention. When there is a dead body, what is missing? The spirit. And we call it a dead body. A dead body does not have attention. So, attention is the spirit. To nurture the spirit, you have to bring it here, because your Kundalini will bring the attention here. She is nurturing. The energy of the Paramchaitanya is coming, and it is nurturing. It is purifying that chitta. The purifying of the chitta happens here. But you can nurture your chakras by putting your right hand on them and your left hand towards Shri Mataji. That's how we nurture the chakras. But for nurturing the Sahasrara, it's the Paramchaitanya's energy. That's why we do the fourth point, come down, and you feel better.

And read good books. The Devi Bhagavata. The Durga Saptashati. Why do we have to do this? Once, there was a public program of Shri Mataji's in Porchester Hall, and we went there. We were a little behind. After the program, everybody was going to Shri Mataji to meet Her. So, I went there, and Shri Mataji said, "Oh, you came." She held my hand and told me, "The Ardha Stotra is my favorite stotra." And then she said, "You must do it. And do Sahaja Yoga. Go deep. You will always benefit. There is no loss." And then she started talking to someone. And this head started thinking, in Porchester Hall, with all these people here, why is she mentioning to me that the Ardha Stotra is Her favorite?
