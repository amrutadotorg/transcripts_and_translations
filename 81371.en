 (England)
Thank you very much, Sandeep Tilwar ji, for joining us this afternoon—here for us in England and evening for you in India. Tell us, please, first of all, thanks for taking the time out to join us and share with us your precious, incredible memories with Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

Where did it all begin for you? Where were you and when was it? Could you please share with us the journey when it began?

Sandeep Tilwar ji: So, it began with our family meeting for my younger sister's wedding. She was supposed to have chosen a boy who was Shri Mataji's elder brother's son. He was a minister in the Indian government, and my father was very active socially as well as in the British High Commission. So, he used to meet a lot of politicians during his heydays in Delhi. And that's where I think the families came to know that he had a son. They were looking for a bride, and my sister was ready for marriage. Some discussions happened, and then all of a sudden, I was told that the boy's family was coming to see the girl. This was sometime in 1981.

I was just married one year prior to that, and my wife and I were interested in looking after Shri Mataji's entourage that was to come to see the girl. That was the first time I saw Her. We had a staircase, and as Shri Mataji came up, the first thing I saw was her big bindi on her forehead. And then it appeared, the whole body and her radiant, shining face. I remember because I came up to the staircase and I received her. And then I saw a sea of people climbing up along with her; there were about twenty people. Of course, we were told that the entourage would be a big contingent of her family, but there were only two of them actually from the family: Shri Mataji and one was Baba Mama.

I ushered all the twenty other people who came in. When Shri Mataji sat on the sofa, I saw the others immediately taking a place on the carpet in front of her. I was shocked. I said, "Shri Mataji, your family, I would like to respect them by asking them to please come and sit on the sofa." We had prepared high tea for her, and my wife was busy arranging for all that. I was the only one just ushering Shri Mataji to sit down. My mother then came, and they were looking after Shri Mataji as a very special guest. As you know, when we have these marriages, being from the bride's side, we were very, very careful. My sister was getting ready to come and meet the family, but the boy and girl had met already. It was just the family that wanted to meet the girl, and then it was to be finalized.

So that is the first time I met Shri Mataji. When I greeted her, she asked me to sit next to her. I do remember this fact that I objected to sitting next to her because I said, "Unless the guests who have come also sit on chairs and sofas, which we had in the room, I would not sit next to you." She said, "But they don't listen. And if I tell them also, they will not listen." So I said, "Why?" I didn't have to call her Shri Mataji; I used to call her Buaji. So I said, "Buaji, why?" And she said, "Ask them, you know how it is." I just looked at them and they were all just smiling and they had their hands out. I said, "What is this?" She said, "Well, they are Sahaja Yogis and I teach Sahaja Yoga. They consider me as their mother. To respect me, they will not sit at the same level as me."

This actually made me feel so guilty sitting next to her that I also then sat at her feet. She kept objecting that, "You are our Samdhi," you know, we call them Samdhis, the families that are going to get together. But I didn't listen. I said, "Unless they also sit at the same level, I will also sit." And then she held my hand and she said, "Will you also do Sahaja Yoga?" She just asked me like that. My wife was standing there with tea, and then of course, my mother came and this topic got lost. But it had a profound impact, what she did, because she had held my hand. She had made an earnest request: "Will you come and do Sahaja Yoga? I'll teach you."

That was the beginning. I have a feeling I must have gotten my realization at that time because my heart started pumping and I started feeling very, very happy, very fulfilled within me. I've never had this feeling in my life. My life had been quite miserable in the early years. I was the middle child. The elder one was a kind of a rebel in the family because my father was a strict parent. He would not allow freedom to his children to do whatever they liked. He was very careful about what they call Mariyadas, the boundaries within which we had to live. We were in our twenties, we were married—my brother was married, I was married—but my father was a very, very strict man.

We had been brought up like that. As a child, I remember my siblings—my elder brother and my younger sister—they both got either too much affection or too much of a beating. And I was the one who was ignored. In fact, I felt nobody loved me. That was a big story about my life: nobody loves me. I was always drooping on the left side and always crying at my mother's feet as a child. I remember my mother used to say to my relatives, "This guy is a crybaby. At the drop of a hat, he starts howling." And all I was seeking was attention. I wanted attention in my life, which I was not getting. And till the time I was married, I must have nurtured this deep feeling of not being recognized or not being heard.

Even when I used to talk, I could hardly get my voice across. I remember I would say something, and Shri Mataji tried to make conversation with me. I was quite shocked. I said, "Oh, there's somebody who'd like to talk to me. Really? Do I deserve that?" I was trying to answer and she would say, "Hey, what did you say? Please say it loudly." And then she'd look at my parents, because they were all sitting there, and she was asking questions about me. And she'd say, "I can't hear him. Why? What have you done to this boy? You've been shouting a lot at him, it seems, that his voice doesn't come out."

That is how it started, and that excited me a lot—that somebody was giving me so much attention, so much indirect love, inviting me to do something. You know, we were going guru shopping. My mother used to go to Ramakrishna Mission; she went to so many other gurus. And as kids... my father used to be a very busy doctor. He had run a nursing home, so he was very busy and he was a very angry man. We all used to stay out of his range; we would not come too close to him. He had a loud voice, he used to shout a lot. He used to smoke at least 50 to 60 cigarettes a day, and we were all afraid of him. He was a kind of very indulgent human being.

Interviewer: I just wanted to share with our listeners that it's such a nice opportunity where Shri Mataji holds your hand. And just to give a background, like you were saying, the in-laws... so the prospective son-in-law or daughter-in-law's family is called Samdhi in India. And your younger sister, their family coming to your home, this is more than a VVIP visit. So no wonder you were trying to make them all comfortable and wanted them to sit on the sofas, with the special arrangements for looking after them. And yet, there she is, Shri Mataji, holding your hand and telling you, "Will you do Sahaja Yoga?" and giving you that love that only Shri Mataji does to her children.

We are all so lucky, but it's such a juxtaposition of affection and yet such a formal environment. Because your good wife and your parents and your sister, while she's getting ready to meet the family—Shri Mataji and Baba Mama and the Sahaja Yogis that were present there—you can see the whole drama unfolding at so many levels, isn't it? And Shri Mataji working it out, highlighting that she couldn't hear you. That is actually the beginning of a very beautiful story, isn't it?

Sandeep Tilwar ji: Yes, yes, yes. This was in 1981. It must have been very early in the year because it was wintertime. My sister got married sometime in March, so within two months it all happened. We were very careful because it was a huge arrangement my father had to make. Mr. NKP Salve, who was Shri Mataji's elder brother, arranged the Hyderabad House in Delhi, which was supposed to be used only by the President and the Prime Minister for state guests. And we were hosting the reception for her wedding there. The wedding took place in our house, and he came with the band, baja, baraat, and everything. Shri Mataji was present in all the functions.

One amazing thing was that my father and my mother both sing. They are both very fond of singing. We used to travel with them so much on holidays that a holiday started with singing. My dad would drive the car and he would go on singing film songs or ghazals or some music. My mother was a classical singer. And they both were rendering so much music that all three of us took to singing eventually in our lives. This carried on for my entire life, even till today.

So this first meeting with Shri Mataji, and the wedding that took place at Hyderabad House, which must have been your second meeting... of course, but there were about a thousand people there. We were looking after the guests, so I don't know if I even got so close to her because we were all on duty. The brothers are basically the ones who are doing all the work to make sure that the reception goes well. So those were times when we were singing; we were singing in the wedding. Shri Mataji heard us singing. And they said that this is the singing and the eating and the enjoying family of Delhi. That's how Mr. Salve used to joke. He was also very fond of music. So this whole musical thing happened at the wedding time, and Shri Mataji remembered that very much, that I used to be singing a lot. I think that's where she took the lead to make me a singer.

There's a story behind it, but from 1981 to 1984, there was a lull. My parents started doing Sahaja Yoga immediately after the wedding. Shri Mataji started to invite them over wherever she was traveling overseas. They were very fond of traveling, so they would mix their holidays along with Shri Mataji's visits to various countries in Europe and the USA, in Canada, wherever she was traveling in those times, 1982, 1983. So those years, my parents were very busy being with Mother.

All I remember is that I was just married a year back, and I had also seen my sister getting married, and my brother also had been recently married two years before that. We were all a very new family coming together. There was the question of our survival, because my father was a medical doctor and none of us children took after him. He was running a nursing home, a full-fledged 16-bedded hospital. My brother took to commerce, and I took to technology. We were in college, and when we finished, there was this struggle about taking jobs. My brother took to business, and I, being a chemical technologist, got a job in Bombay. So I had actually moved to Bombay and had come specially from Bombay for this marriage. I had taken leave and come, so I went back to my job. I got so busy, so busy, that two years went by without my having even touched anything about Sahaja Yoga.

At some point, my mother was following some guru, and I kept on going to that guru even after I had met Shri Mataji. Though I loved everything she told me, somewhere or the other, the other guru had not left. That started to simmer off slowly as I started to compare both the gurus.

Then my father had a very bad accident in the house. He fell and both his retinas got detached. He almost lost his eyesight. He had just 15% vision in one eye and couldn't see at all in the other. So he was almost blind. He sent an SOS to me that I had to leave my job and come and run his nursing home. My wife has a master's in economics, so he said she could run the administration. He asked me to be the chief administrator while he was on bed recouping. I think some doctor had made a mistake while operating on his eyes, and something went wrong. But he was already doing Sahaja Yoga; he had started from 1981 onwards when the marriage happened.

He told me that Shri Mataji was coming to Delhi and she had come to know of his problem. He asked me to resign from my job. So I took a long leave for six months. My boss wasn't going to let me go; I had a good job in Bombay. I was living with my wife and my little daughter, she was born in '82. When I came back to Delhi to be with my father, my wife immediately took over all the work of his nursing home. I was asked to be with him and work on him because at that time, Dr. Warren was living with us. He had shifted to our house and was trying to work on my father's back to get his eyes back. There was a big struggle going on in the family because of this problem.

And then Shri Mataji came to our house and she worked on his back. I saw this with my own eyes: his entire eyesight came back. The doctors were shocked. It must have been a very short time that Shri Mataji worked on him, and then she told Dr. Warren how to continue working. She asked him to stay with my dad for six months. In fact, my mother shifted out of her room, and they were both in the same room together. In the night, he would do his candling; in the morning, he would teach him meditation. My father was into meditation in a very big way.

Then I saw the transformation in my father. When I got back, I saw he had left cigarettes. He was not smoking at all; he was smoking 50 cigarettes a day and he left it all. Overnight, he stopped drinking and he stopped raising his voice, getting angry. The whole house had gone very peaceful. That transformation that took place while I was away in Bombay was a shocker for me. And then I saw Shri Mataji working on him and his eyesight coming back. Then there was no going back.

I resigned from my job in 1983. When I came back, I couldn't adjust with running a hospital because I was a chemical engineer. My elder brother was supposed to be there with my father, but he was away in America and Canada on a very long trip for his export business. My father told me, "Your brother has been struggling very hard in exports. I think you should join him and leave your job." Then, of course, the man who had given me the job came over and met my father and pleaded, "I need him very badly. Please let him go." My father said, "No, I'm almost blind and I'm recovering. I want my son to stay with me."

So it happened that I gave it a six months' time. I told my boss, "I'll join you. Don't worry. Let me put things right back home." But while trying to put things right, I was totally sucked in, with Dr. Warren around and Dr. Nigam coming very often to our house. Dr. Nigam was the leader of Delhi at that time. Shri Mataji probably had put all these people in charge to make sure that my father became all right. By the time I resigned and came back in 1983, my father was already the leader for Delhi. He was giving lectures on Sahaja Yoga. All our lives, we heard so many lectures from him about a lot of things which didn't make sense, and here he was doing lectures on Sahaja Yoga which was making total sense.

This was after his recovery from his eyesight. He could see, he could walk around. He had about 80 to 85% vision; still 15% vision was bad because some nerve had been damaged. But Shri Mataji worked on him so well that when I saw his recovery, I was turned from inside out. I told myself, what was I doing in this period when Shri Mataji said, "Will you do Sahaja Yoga?" So I was ready for it.

When Shri Mataji came, the first thing she told me—because she came to know that I had started to join my brother in his export business—she said, "Your export business is obviously going to take you overseas. I live in London and I'm going back now. Please come to London and be my guest."

Then an opportunity came in 1984. I was going to Toronto and I just informed Shri Mataji. She used to call my dad many times and have a chat with him from London. One day my dad said, "Shri Mataji wants to talk to you." She said, "So what are your plans? Are you coming?" I said, "Yes, yes." I still used to call her Buaji; there was no Shri Mataji because I hadn't been totally initiated into it. But my readiness was so complete within me that the minute she said, "When are you coming?" I planned my trip so I would stop in London for two days before I went to Toronto. We were appearing for some trade show there, representing our products. We were exporting metal hardware. So, two days I was to come and then Shri Mataji said, "Everything is arranged for you."

I gave my flight details, and she said, "There'll be somebody there to receive you at the airport and bring you to my flat where you can stay. And then we'll meet." Alex Henshaw, from the great Henshaw family, came to receive me at the airport. He said, "Shri Mataji has sent me to take you to Bala's flat." Bala Subramaniam was a Sahaja Yogi from the USA. Shri Mataji had arranged for me to stay there, and Alex stayed with me in the flat. He said, "She asked me to first raise your Kundalini, tell you about Sahaja Yoga, and then you have to do a footsoak. I'll clear you." He did that.

There's a long story to my life, but a lot is coming back to me. That guru who I was following earlier, she happened to be in London at the same time. I was keen that I should go and meet her because she was suffering from tinnitus, which is a problem with the hearing. There were these bells ringing all over in her brain, and she was getting very disturbed. Though she was our guru for a long time, obviously she had not left me. The minute Alex was clearing me, he said, "Your void is catching very badly." So he was giving me candle treatment, he was giving me a footsoak, he even taught me how to shoebeat, how to clear my chakras. I was just dutifully following whatever he was asking me to do.

Then I told Alex, "I have to meet this lady whom I've revered as my guru for so many years because she's lying sick in bed and I need to pay my regards." Alex said, "But you have to take a gift for her, and I'll take you." And you know what gift he gave me? He gave me a book written by Gregoire, The Advent. He said, "Present this to your guru." I said, "Wow." I couldn't understand what was written in The Advent; my understanding was pretty zero at that time. It went above me. I tried to read the book but I couldn't understand, obviously because I had not even had my proper self-realization till then.

He waited in the car. He said, "I'm waiting for you. Meet her for 10 minutes, then we go. Don't spend more than 10 minutes." I think Shri Mataji was working for me to get away from this guru. I just went to her and I asked her, "How are you?" She said, "Oh, I'm in real pain." I said, "Why don't you do Sahaja Yoga? My father just got cured. I feel great. And you've been helping our family so much. Here, if you want to know about it, here is a book I have got as a present for you." I sat with her with all my love for her, looking at her very lovingly. She just took the book in her hands and she flipped it behind the window. There was a window open behind her bed.

The minute she did that, boy, I got up. I said, "You haven't even seen the first page." She said, "It's all humbug. Where are you getting trapped?" She was trying to scold me. Earlier, I used to get scolded and I used to listen to her, but this time I was very bold. I did start to cry that she couldn't do this injustice because this book has Mother's photograph, and she had thrown it. So I ran to the backyard, I picked up the book, and without looking back, I told Alex, "Let's go." I kept crying on the way. Alex told me, "Yes, the time has come for you to get out of this, to clear your mind. This is the moment that Shri Mataji has made it happen." It was all ordained, the way all these things happened. And then he made me shoebeat her and shoebeat myself many, many times till he felt I had cleared. He said, "I have to take you to Mother only when you're totally cleared."

He was very good to me. I still call him my guru brother. He taught me what I should do with my chakras and how I should be within the maryadas of meditation. The next day, he took me to Shri Mataji. We had a very nice meeting, we had tea with her and Sir CP. She told me, "Why didn't Alex take you and show you a bit of London? Just as a tourist, enjoy yourself. In the evening you come, there's going to be a public program, and there you can take your self-realization."

That's exactly what happened. My parents were on a trip to Europe and happened to be in London at that time, so they were there at the public program. I met them there and they knew that Mother had called me for a two-day stopover before going to Canada. I went to the public program. Shri Mataji was giving realization. She was talking. We probably went late, we got very delayed, and by the time we went, Shri Mataji's speech was over, but she was just about to start realization. When she saw me coming, she ushered me to sit right in the front. Two or three people took positions behind my back and they were doing something. Of course, now I know what they were doing. I put out my hands and Shri Mataji was giving realization. I went through the whole process, but I felt nothing. There was too much going on in my mind. It was so difficult to bring myself into balance at that point. But I felt very nice, I'd never felt so peaceful, ever. But I didn't feel any vibrations. When she said, "Raise your hands, those who felt the vibrations," I could not lie, so she noticed.

My parents were also with Shri Mataji and they were invited for dinner. She sent word to me that after the program, I should go in her car with her and have dinner. That's what happened. I went in her car. My dad probably came with some other Sahaja Yogi, but my mother was there in the car with Shri Mataji. I was sitting in the front, and we drove to the Brompton Square house.

The program must have been in Caxton Hall. I don't remember where this program was. It was in 1984, on July 1st, 2nd, or 3rd, maybe. The day I went, it was July 4th, I think, American Independence Day. I remember because that day, Shri Mataji made me sit in the kitchen. She was cooking tandoori chicken for us. She was also cooking. She said, "I have something for you," and she made me sit separately because the others were sitting in the drawing room. My parents and Sir CP were having a chat together, and she took me alone into the kitchen. She said, "Let me give you now, but let me feed you because you're hungry. First you fulfill your Nabhi."

She fed me tandoori chicken. In fact, she cooked, she put the plate in front of me. She looked at me, and while I was eating and enjoying it, she was saying, "How is it?" I said, "It's wonderful, Mother. It's wonderful." I just started calling her Mother; I could not even think of calling her Shri Mataji because I knew everybody called her Mother over there. Then, immediately after I had finished eating, she asked me to put out my hands. She closed her eyes, she moved her hands a bit, and she said, "What do you feel?" And you won't believe this, I felt an absolute cool breeze in my hands. And then on top of my head, she asked me to check, and it was such a wonderful flow. It was like heaven on earth. That was my day of realization. Amazing. I never looked back after that.

One more thing, she told me, "Now you go and sleep. Your parents are going to stay for longer. I'm asking Alex to drop you home. You go and sleep, you'll sleep very well. And I want to tell you one thing: for what purpose you're going to Toronto, it'll work out. Don't worry. Now your realization has happened, everything will start to happen for you." And exactly that happened. I got the biggest export order I could not think of. I went to Toronto, I brought that export order, and I got so busy with processing it and everything. We were flooded with work. That was another amazing, positive experience of my taking self-realization.

Interviewer: Wow. This is so beyond that. Shri Mataji actually gets Alex, who we had the privilege to interview also for Golden Memories, and you were staying at Uncle Bala's place, who also very nicely participated in the interview. So, it's just so nice imagining this, reliving these moments of your visit at Brompton Square, where so many Sahaja Yogis, not just from England but other parts of Europe and the world, worked on that property, on that house to make it, you know, to fulfill Shri Mataji's vision. And here she is. She made tandoori chicken and fed you, and then asked you to go and rest. And then your mission accomplished in Toronto. And here we are in July, talking about this whole episode again, so many years later. 1984 to... 41 years. Isn't that amazing? Jai Shri Mataji, again and again. So, you got busy with processing that absolutely humongous order. Where does the music come into the picture? Or is there any other miracle before that you could share with us?

Sandeep Tilwar ji: Yes, we are going chronologically year-wise. So, I have 40 years to cover, so we'll need more time later. But I can tell you about the miracles. Of course, so many miracles with my father. Then I saw this business coming to me. I was convinced that she was a special person. She was divine. She was Mother. Her words were everything. What she said, worked. I had no doubt that she was the Adi Shakti. And now, I had to listen to all her talks and focus on my subtle system, do the practice, do my clearances, meditate morning and evening.

But when I got back, after the business success, I got after my wife. I said, "You've seen the change in Dad. You've seen what has happened with my work. I think you should also do Sahaja Yoga." She was actually expecting our second child at that time. I had come back in August and we started processing our orders. We got so busy that whole winter, there was no time. I didn't even do much practice, though I had been initiated. But suddenly I saw Dr. Nigam calling me and saying that Mother wanted him to work on me and tell me more about Sahaja Yoga. I said, "Oh, this is wonderful. At least there's somebody to teach me more." After Alex, it was Dr. Nigam.

He would come and he helped because I was going through a rough patch. After that great order I'd had, my brother and I actually parted ways. I was again struggling to find work. Within a year, this happened. One year of great work and enjoying all the success, and then all of a sudden, it all dropped out because of certain issues that happened within the family. My father said, "Now that my eyes are all right and your brother wants to manage on his own, he doesn't need you. So, why don't you look and do something of your own?" So, I said, "Okay, then I'll go back to my job in Bombay." He said, "No, I don't want you to go back." He was very attached to me; all of a sudden his love had grown. He would not let me go. And my wife was doing a fantastic job running his institution. He said, "I'm not going to let her go. I'm going to double her salary." So, he was controlling me. I said, "Well, I have to give up my chemical line completely." He said, "No, we'll set up a factory for you if you want." Because, you know, Mr. Salve was a minister for mines and steel and chemicals. So, that was a little bit of a bait he had thrown.

I gave up my job, but Dr. Nigam started to call me because now I was without work. So, every day or every second day, I was sitting in Dr. Nigam's house. He was working on me, candling me, showing me Mother's talks. For six to eight months, I was listening to all of Mother's talks from the early times until that moment. I had heard all of her tapes and was able to understand a lot about Sahaja Yoga.

Then, you know, there was a poet in me as a child. I used to write poetry. And I used to write a very low kind, a crying type of poetry, you know. Like ghazals, they make you cry, don't they? I was very fond of this crybaby, left-sided stuff. But somehow, once I got my realization and heard what she was saying, I started writing on what Mother was talking about. So, I used to write in prose things about Sahaja Yoga. I got excited about it and I told Dr. Nigam, "I have to show this to Mother." He said, "You know, there's this Devi Puja happening in Calcutta. It was 1985. Why don't you go?" I said, "No, no, no. I still have to look for work. I can't afford to go on my own." I don't know what he did after that. He probably spoke to my dad.

My dad had already left for Calcutta, where Shri Mataji was. Mr. Jalan was looking after the arrangements in West Bengal for Shri Mataji's tour and public programs, and there was supposed to be a Devi Puja there. So, I got an SOS from my father when he reached Calcutta. He said, "There are three days left. Shri Mataji's public programs are going to happen. I want you and your brother and your wife and his wife, all four of you, on the flight. I am paying for it. Shri Mataji wants the whole family there." My wife couldn't go; she was expecting. But my brother, my sister-in-law, and I, we flew.

We were brought to Mr. Jalan's house and immediately ushered into the room where Shri Mataji was sitting. Shri Mataji told me—and this is what surprised me, and this is what she kept telling me after that—"You are writing about Sahaja Yoga." I never told her. She knew. I had written some couplets. Yogi Mahajan was sitting at her feet and said, "Why don't you read it out to Shri Mataji?" So, Shri Mataji encouraged me. "Okay, what have you written?" So, then I had written one poetry. Can I sing it for you?

(Sandeep ji sings a bhajan)

I sang this song at the puja also, which I had composed. And then she said, "We'll go to Jaipur. And you come with..." I think Calcutta happened in October. My wife delivered a child on the 30th of September. By the time I got back, it was going to be December, and I got the news: Shri Mataji is coming to Jaipur. She came to Jaipur, and then that story of my music journey started from Jaipur. So, 1985 December. Ganpati Pule happened that same year. Everybody told me they were going, but I couldn't. I was still not ready for it. So I missed the first Ganpati Pule, the very first one.

When she was back from Ganpati Pule, she told us how grand it was, and I felt how much I must have missed by not going there. But she said, "Now you come." And I met her in Jaipur. She was doing her public programs there. And then this trip happened with her in a car. I drove, and she sat next to me. There were three people behind in the car, and that journey was a 3,000-kilometer journey. We did it in a couple of days. We met in Jaipur. We stayed in the same house as Mrs. Pardal, who was the leader for Jaipur. Mrs. Pardal also happened to be a classmate of my mother's from college. Amazing instances, I think it was God-sent that they gelled so much.

We had gone to Jaipur especially to see the jharokhas and the materials to be put in Pratishthan, Pune. She was looking to buy them in their original form and then have them shipped to Pune. So from that moment, she had planned that she would do a public program in Jaipur, there would be a small puja, and then she would go on this tour of Rajasthan.

Well, Rajesh Shah had arranged for a Mercedes car to take Shri Mataji. The driver and everybody was arranged, and Shri Mataji was to start her journey. And then this miracle... how many miracles can I tell you? But I'll share this one with you, how the music really started. It was the Vishuddhi that had to be opened first. Only then could I become a musician. She had already initiated my Swadhishthan for writing poetry, and I was understanding Sahaja Yoga very well. She liked what I wrote, but the opening of the Vishuddhi happened in the car journey.

How it happened was the Mercedes driver got sick. Shri Mataji asked me to drive her in my car because she had to leave at a fixed time. They were trying to put off the journey, saying, "We'll arrange for another driver." And Shri Mataji said, "I don't have time. I have to go now. This is the time for me to go. I'm asking Sanjay to take me in his car." They said, "How can you go in a small Fiat car?" But I said, "Mother, there are bucket seats, so she'll be comfortable in the front seat with me." She said, "Yes, I'll sit with you." They were objecting, but Shri Mataji said everybody had to listen. My wife and Mrs. Pardal were in the back seat, and we took that journey early morning from Jaipur.

We first stopped in Didwana, and there were a couple of small miracles. My car was shifting to the left side. The tire was punctured. It was pulling on one side, and it was getting night. The roads were very narrow, and I was the only man. There's one more man, of course, Manish, who used to cook for Shri Mataji. I was afraid. I was worried, what will I do in the night? Mother is next to me, I have to take care of her, and this car is going to have a puncture. I wasn't very good at handling punctures. So all this was worrying my mind.

Shri Mataji said, "What's happened? Why are you looking so worried?" I said, "Mother, the car is pulling on the left." She said, "No, no, continue driving. No such problem." The minute she said that, the car stabilized and stopped pulling. The puncture was fixed automatically. I was so shocked. It was pulling for so long, and now Mother said no, and it just went straight through. After about 30 or 40 minutes, she said, "Stop. There's a petrol pump there. I need to go to the washroom." But before she left for the washroom, she said, "Now change the tire."

A man came running from behind and said, "Sir, your rim of the wheel is actually touching the ground. The tire must have been torn apart. I may have to get you a retreaded new tire." He asked me how long it had been running like that, and I said, "More than 20-25 minutes." He said, "Oh my God, how could you? This should have ruptured completely. It can't run for that long." I said, "You check first. Don't just speculate." So he checked. Nothing had happened to the tire. He just got the puncture repaired in five minutes and put it back. But his face was shocked. He couldn't believe what had happened. I had no time to explain to him. So when Mother came, we just left.

This was one miracle. The other one was when we were traveling a little ahead, Shri Mataji made us stop the car because she wanted to walk. There was this village with shops and a small pavement. Shri Mataji had to go up a few steps. My wife and the others got out with her and made her walk up to the pavement. We saw a man standing with a wheelchair and a very old man, maybe more than 75, just looking at the crowd in the marketplace. A young boy was looking very worried. Shri Mataji just went past his wheelchair. She said, "What happened to him?" The boy said, "Well, he's been crippled for many, many years. He cannot walk. He comes on a wheelchair in the evening, looks at the crowd, makes himself happy, and I take him back." She just bent down and touched his knees. She said, "Come on, come on. Walk with me." He was a little surprised, but she said, "Get up." And he got up and started walking. And this man was jumping, the one with the wheelchair, saying for many years he's not been able to walk. He was medically crippled. So these were the things Shri Mataji was showing us during that trip.

The other one was when we were driving, Shri Mataji was working behind me on my chakras. She had her right hand behind me, going from chakra to chakra, until her hand reached my neck. She was massaging it counter-clockwise from the back. Then she asked me, "Oh, it's such a long journey. Why don't you sing a song?" I said, "Oh, I only know film songs." She said, "Okay, you sing a film song then." So I sang a song from the movie Safar. When I sang that, Shri Mataji said, "Sing it again now, but keep me in mind. Not the Mahbubah (beloved), but keep me in mind. I am the Devi." So I sang, and then she asked everybody how the vibration was. They said, "Oh, Mother, it's so cool, so wonderful." And she said, "Well, this is a Sahaj song now. You can record it." There was no word change, but you just have to put it on the Devi instead of the beloved one.

That was the first song I sang in the car. And then she asked me for another one. She said, "Now what you do is change the words." She dictated all the words. She dictated the words in the car. She said, "Now what you do is apply these words to the same tune and sing again." That's how the song was evolved.

After a few hours, Shri Mataji had to go to the washroom, but there was no washroom there. There were these big fields, you know, with long crops you could just walk through. It was nighttime, with the moon and the stars. It was a clear night. There was another pilot car sent by Rajesh Shah to help us, which came at the petrol pump when we were changing the tire. Shri Mataji moved into that car and asked us to follow. Then, somewhere, Shri Mataji stopped to go to the washroom. Somebody from the other car gave a message: "You both stay there. She left a message for you, Sanjay, that she wants you to continue writing a poem. When she comes, the poem should be ready."

Frantically, my wife and I—we were so lost in Shri Mataji that the poem was just flowing. We wrote the song Bekhabar Hoke Aap Yun Na Jaiye. It was from a Hemant Mukherjee song. I wrote the words myself because Mother had shown me how I could do the same for another song. She was prompting me to start writing.

When it was done and we were waiting for Mother, an amazing thing happened. We felt our car was moving in outer space. First, we felt our car had gone into space, and then we realized we were not in space; we were on the ground. The floor could be seen. So how was the sky so close? It was like the stars were just there and the moon was so huge. We were just floating in space. And both of us felt, "Oh my God, what's this?" For a moment, yes, I said, "Where are we? Where are we transported all of a sudden?" It was a trance-like situation.

Then Mother came back. The other car was in front, and she came up to our window and said very clearly, "When I am there, the sun, the moon, and the stars, and the entire universe comes to my feet." She said that and she left. We never shared our experience with her, but she had answered what we had been through. Amazing, isn't it?

The trip itself... after a few hours, we reached a motel. The owner of that motel kept running and told us to stop the car. It was 10 o'clock at night, and there was this big haveli. He just came, laid on the ground prostrate at her feet. He had this red shawl, and he opened Shri Mataji's door and said, "Hey Devi, come and please bless my home." She got up and said, "We're all going to stay tonight at his house." I asked the others, "Was it planned?" They said, "No." He was just running so fast, and Shri Mataji said, "Stop, stop, stop. There's this man running." She knew he was a Devi Bhakt. We got out of our cars, took our luggage, and he put us up in beautiful rooms in his small hotel-type haveli.

We all assembled in Mother's room first to settle her in. The first thing while she was sitting down, she said, "So, bring that poetry that you had written in the car." She was so interested. I read out the poetry to her and she said, "Okay, now we have to change some words." So she gave some words. The original film song was totally converted by her into these lyrics. We did 18 songs on that trip. After three nights, we were back in Jaipur.

And one last thing I would like to say. This was the one that... I don't know what to say about it. She made me see my own deity. There was this meditation going on in Jaipur, and there were these 40 yogis sitting. Shri Mataji would be sitting there like a photograph herself with her hands out. She would be still and close her eyes, and we would all be meditating. I happened to come very late for the meditation. I tiptoed from the first floor; the meditation hall was just in front. I was tiptoeing down the spiral staircase. There was a candle lit on the side of the staircase. The minute I tiptoed to come down, halfway through, I saw a ball of fire rotating and coming from the right side of that wall. It went up to the roof above the heads of the 40 people who were sitting, leaving stars behind it, like a comet. It went swish, swish, swish and went to the other side of the room and disappeared.

When this happened, at that moment, Shri Mataji opened her eyes. Very wide, very, very wide. And she looked straight at me. I just froze. I saw what I had seen. I had just moved my head and saw that fire go, and she also moved her head. She just looked at me. At that moment I saw that candle; the fire became so huge it was almost touching the sky. I'd never seen a candle with such a big flame. Then when she closed her eyes, the flame settled down, and everybody was quietly meditating. My heart was pounding. Quietly, I went down and sat down.

After the meditation was over, people would gently come to her feet, and she'd talk to everybody. That was the way it was in those early days. I tiptoed to the back of Shri Mataji's chair and just stood there. I didn't want to disturb her. Then all of a sudden, she looked back and asked me to come in front. When I came in front, she cupped her hand on my ear and she said, "That was your Vishnu Maya." And she said, "That's your deity. And you've seen your deity. Now you will have no problem with your Vishuddhi. Your Left Vishuddhi has been totally cleared. Now you can go and sing and create music and give this to Sahaja Yoga." This was what she proclaimed. I was like, "Oh, Mother chose me for this work."

At that very moment, I went into the room and I remember a poem flowed from me. I wrote the poem and came back. She told everybody, "I have to correct this poem," and she corrected it. The poem said that the sum total of what a Sahaja Yogi is and what he ought to do with his realized state is that we have to adorn a beautiful garden of flowers and trees, which will give beauty, their fragrance, and shelter to the whole world. That is the work of our life. She said, "Now you work on the rest. It'll come through you. Because now your Left Vishuddhi is cleared. Your Vishnumaya principle is okay. You can go on now and announce what you have to do."

And from that moment, it has not stopped. This song I sang in her public program in Jaipur, and a couple of other songs I had made during the trip. I saw people actually getting up from their seats because we used to sing before Shri Mataji would come and speak, so that they would be ready. She said, "All your songs actually lift the Mahakali Shakti. They lift your left side."

My first recording, Ruhani Roshni, happened within a year and a half. The 18 songs that I had made, she made me record them and bring them to Ganpati Pule in 1986. In January 1987, I was performing at Ganpati Pule. Then she told me that she wanted to do a big recording in Bombay in the style that the films do. She said, "I want you to bring a good, big singer also who's popular." So I got Kavita Krishnamurthy. We gave her self-realization, and she sang in my album, Ruhani Roshni. She was actually monitoring the recording. So many experiences happened during this recording time. This photo is her inaugurating this cassette while she was having her breakfast in Ganpati Pule in December 1987. In 1988, this was officially released by her. She took the masters and said, "I'm going to take them overseas and make copies, and I'm going to bring them and distribute them to all the Sahaja Yogis." Then my cassettes were coming in thousands and selling in Ganpati Pule. And this never stopped for the next 20 years. I think I did over 150 songs in 21 albums, bringing them to Ganpati Pule right until 2003, when Shri Mataji attended the last Ganpati Pule. I was going every year from 1987 to 2004.

Interviewer: So beautiful to listen to your stories. And we've only covered the tip of the whole recollections, I would say. It has been wonderful, and I know you're pressed for time, so we will reschedule for another time if you would like to share the other stories, because I think all of us would like to know more and just enjoy those times with you. Being in the car, driving Shri Mataji, being with Shri Mataji, the stars and the moon... it's just another world altogether. You're at a different level, isn't it? She takes us beyond. And the songs that you wrote for her, would you like to sing one as a conclusion for today's interview?

Sandeep Tilwar ji: Yes. I'll sing a song which she loved. In fact, she used to break into tears when she used to hear it. She said it opens the heart. So here it is. I'll talk about it next time.

(Sandeep ji sings a beautiful, heartfelt bhajan)

Interviewer: So beautiful. Thank you so much for listening to such a beautiful bhajan that you sing for Shri Mataji. We've been listening on our audios, graduating from tape recorders to CDs and now USBs, and to have it live has been a real joy and pleasure. And all thanks to Shri Mataji. So we'll meet again. Jai Shri Mataji. Thank you so much for joining us.

Sandeep Tilwar ji: Thank you for making this possible. Jai Shri Mataji. God bless.
