Well, mine was a strange one because I never expected a present; I expected a reprimand. There was a puja coming up, and I didn't feel worthy of going. I had some sort of negative thoughts—I forget what they were now—and I just didn't want to go. My friends at Brenda's all went, and they said, "Come!" I said, "No, no, I don't want to go. I feel hypocritical." So I didn't go. I said, "I've got a lot of baddies." I wasn't sure what "baddies" were, but it sounded right. So I didn't go.

What amazed me was when they got to the puja...

[Another speaker continues]
We all sat in front of Shri Mataji, and she said, "Where is your husband?" I looked around and thought, "Oh, he's at home, Mother." So she said, "Tell him he has no baddies. Give him this"—some white cotton linen to make a kurta.

[First speaker resumes]
I couldn't believe it. I've still got the white cloth. That's the only present I've ever had.

[Interviewer]
Have you had it made into a...?

[First speaker]
No, I've just kept it. It's so pretty. But that was the story. It's amazing because it makes you realize that she knows every effort.

That reminds me of a time I turned up at a public program one night, and I had a terrible left vishuddhi. I sat right at the back of the hall, as far away from others as I possibly could. At the end of the program, Mother said, "Right, all the yogis can come up and give me a flower." I thought, "I'm not going anywhere near Mother, not in this state."

So there was a long queue, and we were sitting there waiting for it to go down. I saw a yogi in the queue who I needed to speak to, so I thought, "Well, I'll just go and talk to him while he's in the queue. It's going to take a while." I started having a conversation with him, and by the time I finished, the queue had dwindled. I was close enough to Mother for the vibrations to welcome me in, so I thought, "Well, I might as well stay here now."

The queue went down and down and down. Eventually, it got to the chap right in front of me. Mother said to him, "Oh, how are you then?" And he said, "I've got left vishuddhi now." Mother said, "I beg your pardon?" He said, "I've got left vishuddhi now." Mother turned to me and she said, "What did he say?" And I said, "He's got left vishuddhi now."

So Mother worked on him and then got up and went out. She didn't bother to see me.

The other time I remember about presents was after a puja up at the Temple of All Faiths. She bought all the men ties, and she brought these ties out, and they all matched what we were already wearing. I remember one of them had a checked shirt, and they brought out this checked tie. It was incredible.

I had an amazing experience in Pune. It was at a market, and Mother was there with a few of her relatives. She was going around the market, and like Bernard was saying, I was feeling not very good about myself. I was hoping that Mother wouldn't turn her attention to me. I didn't want her to ask me how I was or anything like that, so I was kind of holding back, watching Mother and following at a distance. She was absolutely surrounded by people.

This went on for three-quarters of an hour or an hour. Then I got involved in buying some silk paintings at one of the stalls. When I had finished buying them, I looked up, and suddenly there was hardly anyone in the market. Everyone seemed to have gone. My attention had been on that for half an hour. So I relaxed because Mother wasn't there, and she wasn't going to put her attention on me.

I was walking along, and suddenly, walking towards me was Shri Mataji, completely alone. She was coming towards me, and I was going towards her. We looked at each other, I bowed to her, and she said, "How are you, Ruth?"

I said, "I'm fine, thank you, Mother."

And she said, "Just enjoy. Just enjoy." Then she walked past.

When I got back to the camp, I said, "I met Mother at the market, and she spoke to me." And they said, "No, that's impossible because she was surrounded by people the whole time she was there. And when she left, she was surrounded by people."

It just showed how she cared. She knew how I was feeling and how I was holding back.

[Interviewer]
Remind us where it was and when.

[Speaker]
That was in Pune, in 1988. It's amazing.
