 (England)
Jai Shri Mataji. Jai Shri Mataji, Dr. Sandeep Rai. Thank you for joining us this beautiful, sunny morning in England, and from Mumbai there. Thank you for taking this time out to share with us these absolutely exceptional, unparalleled, incredible times of your life. Thank you so much.

Thank you for giving us this opportunity to share some views and some stories which happened long back. This is regarding my father, who was a very well-renowned physiologist in India. He worked at Maulana Azad Medical College, Lady Hardinge, and at JIPMER, the Postgraduate Medical Institute, which is one of the three main institutes in India. Those are AIIMS, PGI Chandigarh, and JIPMER. So, he was the head of the department there also.

It so happened that one of my close relatives, Dr. Nigam, whom everyone knows in Sahaja Yoga, was in Delhi and was a leader for Sahaja Yoga for a long time. He had suffered a stroke at a very young age when he was practicing in UP, and he was brought to Delhi for treatment. After treatment, he came in touch with a Sahaja Yogi for his realization, and he felt very good after. He could sleep well, and then he understood that there is something in this Sahaja Yoga. So he wanted to meet Shri Mataji. In 1981-82, there were very few people in Delhi, so he got a chance to meet Shri Mataji, where she asked him that she wants some research done on Sahaja Yoga.

Now, he was already a patient of stroke and was recovering, so he thought that it may not be possible for him to do anything because he was not based in an institution at that time. But he remembered about my father, who was a very renowned physiologist, and physiology people do research. He was in a research-oriented department and a close relative. So, this was in 1982-83. My father told him that the Indian government wasn't very keen to give grants for Sahaja Yoga, and things went here and there.

But then, in '84, my father, while sitting in his office, had some vertigo and some giddiness. The professor of medicine saw him. He became okay in 15-20 minutes, but she thought that he needed a CT scan. CT scans were very few at that time, so he was sent to a hospital associated with the medical college, and he was admitted for the scan purpose only. It so happened that Dr. Nigam was meeting Shri Mataji at that time, and he told her that the professor he was talking about got a little unwell and was in RML Hospital for a day for a scan. So, Shri Mataji sent some Sahaja Yogis to give him vibrations. We saw these foreigners, very nice and energetic-looking gentlemen from different countries. They came and they gave vibrations.

It was a routine thing, and we thought that they were doing something to the aura or some chakras, which I had some knowledge of from childhood. I had read some books from Rishikesh from these Vedic gurus and scholars, and I had seen the chakras and the Kundalini in those books, so I had some idea about this. They did it, and it was okay. My father was otherwise fine; he was talking to everybody while lying there. He had just come for a scan and was to be discharged the same night. So he was discharged, and we went back.

Then, what happened was that my sister delivered a son who was quite unwell. My father was the vice principal of Lady Hardinge Medical College at that time and the medical superintendent of the hospital attached to it. So, being in a high position, my sister's son was looked after very well by the professor of pediatrics there. He had a special ward and everything. But after a few days of treatment—he had developed septicemia, an infection of the blood that goes to every organ—the doctor didn't want to take much responsibility. She said one day, "You see, he is not improving the way I would have liked him to improve with all these antibiotics. Maybe... I mean, I can't say anything. He might recover, but I'm not very sure. Kindly keep your fingers crossed. I'm not able to give you any guarantee for him."

So then my father requested the leaders there in Delhi. They talked to Shri Mataji—I think Dr. Nigam talked to Shri Mataji—and she said, "Call them at Dr. Talwar's house. I'm going there in the evening." So me, my mother, my sister, and my father all went there, and we reached just two minutes after Shri Mataji had arrived. We went up the stairs following her. Shri Mataji sat there in the drawing room, took the child, took off his shoes, and rubbed his head, his Sahastrara, his body, and his feet. Then she gave him to my father and said, "Okay, the child will be okay. You take him." We brought the child back, and after a few days, he recovered well.

Then my father got a little inquisitive and said, "I want to meet Shri Mataji again." When he met Shri Mataji, he asked, "Mother, what did you do?" Shri Mataji told him, "I did the Kundalini. I just cleared the chakras and activated the Kundalini." My father said that this is not seen in modern science. "We can't see the Kundalini and chakras when we dissect the body." She said, "Yes, it is in the subtle body. You can't see it. But why don't you research? You may not be able to see it, but if you make people do Sahaja Yoga meditation, you may see indirect good effects on their health. That will tell you that something is happening in the body. Then you take it as a hypothesis and prove it. And you are in a big position by the grace of God. You have so many grants, and you can have medical students. You can do a thesis on this."

That is how the Sahaja Yoga research started in Lady Hardinge Medical College. Shri Mataji sent all of them—Dr. Nigam, Dr. Talwar, and all—to come and give vibrations to the patients. They would take patients from the medicine department to the physiology department, and these people would give vibrations and make them meditate. And they saw very good results. The MD physiology thesis got accepted by Delhi University, the papers came out and got published, and then Shri Mataji was very happy.

In fact, some doctor who later was saying that not very sophisticated instruments were used, in '85 Shri Mataji once remarked that all these researches Professor Rai did were under my direct attention. She said, "They are significant researches, and they were done in my total attention." Because it was Shri Mataji who was interested in the research, not Professor Rai. We came to know later that two years back she had already asked Dr. Nigam, "Kindly find some person who can do research. I want research on Sahaja Yoga because I want it to be scientifically proven. I don't want it to be like other things, that people should confuse it with imagery, with placebo effects, with good feeling, mesmerism, or hypnotism. It should have concrete medical evidence so that people really believe it." And that is why all these initial researches were in the direct attention of Shri Mataji.

Not only that, Shri Mataji sent a lot of doctors from different parts, some young doctors also, to meet my father and to understand how research on Sahaja Yoga can be done. And a lot of other doctors then started researching Sahaja Yoga, like young Dr. Ramesh Manocha. I recently met him a few days back in Mumbai; he keeps coming to the health center. He did some very good research in Australia. Initially, Shri Mataji sent him to my father to meet and discuss, and then he was able to do very good research.

Then a lot of good researchers in Russia, like Golodokhin, who is now in the US, did good research. And now so many of them have done research on Sahaja Yoga. Katya Rubia is there in the UK. Then we did many projects in MGM Medical College and the International Sahaja Yoga Research and Health Center in Mumbai; we did combined collaborative projects. Henry from the Canary Islands did very good work on how the brain volume increases with meditation. Lodish from Italy is doing very good research. Dr. Wolfgang from Austria did very good work on addiction. David Spiro did some preliminary work. Morgan from the UK did a lot of work. Hendrik did a combined study on psychological effects. All over the world, from the US, from Canada, Ram Mishra did good work on endorphins.

I have very fond memories of meeting many of these doctors, including Dr. David Spiro, with my father. And Brian Wells—very fond memories of him coming to the Health Center and me meeting him with my father. I have not met Morgan, but he has done some very good work, and we quote his work. I met Katya Rubia in the United Nations Conference in Bonn; a very good researcher from the UK. And Golodokhin, who was in Russia at that time and did very good work. Now Hendrik from the Canary Islands, Spain, is doing very good work on MRI, showing that the brain size increases, that it thickens and grows with meditation. So, after Professor Rai started, it just spread. So many of these big doctors and researchers have contributed so much to Sahaja Yoga that now we have enough evidence gathered to tell people how Sahaja Yoga works. We have scientific proof. It's just not imagery or visualization or hypnotism. All the evidence exists to prove the benefits of this very, very subtle and seemingly easy science that Shri Mataji has made possible. It is just like that, where people had to leave their families and households and go up into the mountains or forests seeking the truth, and here Shri Mataji has made it possible.

Host: So how did you perceive this? At that point, when your father got his realization, you were yourself a medical student. Tell us about your journey, please.

Dr. Sandeep Rai: Yes, I was just graduating, and I was seeing all this. As I told you, from childhood, we used to go to Rishikesh. My father was a seeker, so a lot of saints and sages used to visit. I had a preliminary idea about spirituality and had read about various chakras and the Kundalini in the Vedic system. But my passion was my profession. I wanted to be a more astute clinician and a good researcher. In fact, I wanted to go to the United States, establish a good practice, and get elevated in my profession.

I was not too much inclined towards Sahaja Yoga in the beginning because I thought, "Okay, Father is researching, let him research." I saw Shri Mataji as a big saint, a VIP, with a lot of people trying to meet her. So I used to be like a driver for my father, whom he would go to see almost every day when she was in India. The research was the main attraction, and because he used to talk about it, he used to get a free entry to Shri Mataji's house every day. I used to go and drop him at Shri Mataji's place. I would either go to my hospital, come back, and pick him up, or if he said, "Just wait, it will take me half an hour or so," I would just sit there alone in the meditation room down at Qutub Ashram.

When he would come down, I would take him in my car and go. So one fine day, Shri Mataji asked my father, "Where is your son? Does he come here?" My father said, "Yes, Shri Mataji, he comes." "So how do you come here?" "He drops me in his car." "And how do you go back?" "He takes me." "So he comes here?" My father said, "Yes, he comes here."

Shri Mataji used to be on the second floor. She asked, "So how do you come up?" He said, "Shri Mataji, he says that, 'You go, it is your work. You go and meet Shri Mataji. I will sit down, and when you come back, I will pick you up and go.'" So Shri Mataji sent one senior Sahaja Yogi down. He came rushing down while I was sitting in the meditation hall. He said, "Shri Mataji has called you." I said, "Calling me? Why? What happened?" He said, "I don't know. Come up quickly."

So I went up, I bowed down to Shri Mataji, and did my pranams. And Shri Mataji said, "Why don't you come up? You come every day." I said, "Yes, I come." She said, "Why don't you come up?" I said, "Shri Mataji, it is so difficult to meet you. There are so many people standing on the first floor, all the big leaders and Yuva Shaktis, and nobody will allow me. I tried once, but nobody allowed me. So I said, why push my way through?" I was a little embarrassed. So she told the people there, "Don't stop him when he wants to come. Let him come."

Then she told me to sit down. She asked, "What do you do?" I said, "I have graduated and I want to do my post-graduation." She asked me, "You want to go to the US?" I said, "Let me see if I can do PG." She said, "It's very easy for us. We can send you to the US. That's not a problem." I kept quiet at that time.

Then she said, "What do you think about Sahaja Yoga?" I was sitting there and said, "Shri Mataji, it's very good." She said, "Yes, yes, yes. Your sister's son became okay." I said, "Yes, he's become okay, by your blessings and your divine grace." She said, "Okay." Then she told a senior Sahaja Yogini's wife who was in the kitchen, "Get some tea and sweets for him." They brought a saucer cup of tea and good sweets for me and kept it on the carpet. Everyone was sitting down, and I started drinking the tea. Everyone started staring at me. I started eating the sweets.

Then, as everyone was staring at me, I couldn't understand why. I mean, Shri Mataji got sweets and tea, and I'm eating it. While eating, what I did was—it was a very, very delicious sweet from some great sweet maker of India, difficult to get—so in a tissue paper, I kept two pieces. I thought I'll take it home for my mother, and my wife may also have it. I kept it in the tissue paper, and on this side, I was eating and taking tea. Everyone was quite aghast, staring at me and looking back again and again. So when everyone started looking, I just ate the piece I was having, wrapped up the tissue, and left half the tea. The senior Sahaja Yogini was there, and she took up the tea. She was also waiting, wanting to snatch the cup and take it because, at that time, I didn't know that it was not right to drink in front of Shri Mataji. I was very, very confused.

Then she saw me putting the sweets in the tissue paper and told the Yuva Shakti, "Give two, three pieces more. Pack it properly. He can take it home, and other people can also eat." I said, "No, Mother, this is okay." "No, no, no. Take more. Take more." I got a little embarrassed because she had seen me keeping them in the tissue.

Later, my father said, "What did you do? Why are you keeping sweets in a tissue? And why were you taking tea?" I said, "Shri Mataji said to give me tea. What should I do? Should I just let it sit there? I have to take it." He said, "You don't know, nobody takes tea and eats in front of Shri Mataji." I didn't know. I said, "Why? They are serving it, so why not eat it?" He said, "No, you should have left it lying there." I couldn't understand.

So this happened. Many days I used to go, and then Shri Mataji knew he is not too much interested in Sahaja Yoga. So what she would do was, she would tell me, "You see Sir CP. He is very fond of doctors. You go and see him. Whenever you come, examine him and just see his chest and other things." So now my entry started as a doctor to Sir CP, and he used to be very happy. Every second or third day, I used to go up. This was in about '85, '86, '87. He would tell Shri Mataji, "Sir CP has also come," and I would go to his room, examine him, and come out. Then I used to come back, and Shri Mataji used to say, "How is he?" "He is good." "Better see him every day because he is very fond of doctors." So I said okay. And that was my routine, that people understood that my father will come to talk to Shri Mataji, and I will go and see Sir CP.

While coming back, I would sit down in front of Shri Mataji. It started that Shri Mataji then made me sit one day in front of her and said, "Put your hands towards me. How are you feeling?" There were so many people sitting there, I couldn't feel anything. But I told Shri Mataji, "I am feeling nice. I am feeling relaxed." "Any feeling on the hands?" I just said, "A little bit cool, Mother," like that. But when I came down, I told my father, "Papa, I don't feel anything." He said, "Just keep on going to Shri Mataji. One day you will feel it." Now, going was compulsory because I had to go with my father.

Slowly, I could get some feeling on my hands, but I was not sure. Is it a vibration I am feeling, or is it something I am thinking or feeling, or is it something from the AC? Much later, one day in Pratishtan, Shri Mataji told me, "Now put your hands in front of me." She was in the guest room in a white sari, and Yogi Ji—such a distinguished personality in Sahaja Yoga who has written so many books and was there right from the beginning—Yogi Ji was standing there. She said, "Put your hands like this towards me. And then tell me, now do you feel the full vibrations? Tell me honestly."

Now, I thought, so many people are looking at me, but I was not feeling much. So I said, "No, Mother, I don't feel it." She said, "Okay. Do it again." I did again, and she directly gave me vibrations and said, "Do you feel it?" "No, Mother, I don't feel it." Then she told Yogi Ji, "Look. Waves of vibration are coming from him. So much is flowing. Why is he not feeling it? You go and correct his Vishuddhi." So Yogi Ji came behind me, put my neck... he massaged it a little, and he just cracked it two or three times. And Shri Mataji said, "Okay. You go to meditation, foot soak and all. Vibrations are flowing tremendously, but you are not feeling them." I said, "Okay, Mother." But she said, "It's okay. As long as they are flowing, it's okay. You may not feel it, that's okay. But continue doing your meditation."

That was proof to me sometime later when I went to see Sir CP in Delhi. I bowed down and did pranams to Shri Mataji, and then went to the Nizamuddin Scout Ground. When I went there, there was my friend from Mumbai, Dr. Ramesh Daipude, who is very sensitive in vibrations. He used to come to Delhi also to help me and my father when the research was going on. He had come there to attend a program. When I went to him, he said, "What were you doing? Have you meditated?" I said, "No, I was in the hospital." He said, "Then?" "I went for 10 minutes to Qutub." "Okay, what did you do?" "I saw Sir CP and I did pranams to Shri Mataji." I asked, "Why are you asking?" He said, "I can feel the vibrations coming as waves from your side." And I said, "But I don't feel anything." He said, "That is the thing. You are not feeling it, but I can feel that you have come from a very holy place." That was the proof to me that sometimes if your Vishuddhi is not okay, you may not feel the vibrations, but they may be flowing from your body.

Slowly, slowly, I started feeling them. And as I started feeling them, Mataji's attitude towards me started maturing. In the beginning, it was tea, sweets, sit down. She would talk to me like a normal young graduate doctor. Many things... one day, I still remember, I saw Sir CP, sat there, and she said, "Very nice shirt you are wearing. Very nice shirt." "Is it silk?" I said, "No, Mataji, this is a cotton shirt." "Where did you get it?"

There was a market near our place called Karol Bagh. It's a famous market for the middle class where you get cheap, good things. I said, "I got it from Karol Bagh." Mother knew because she had stayed in Delhi. "Oh, Karol Bagh has such good stuff." Then she called a Yuva Shakti at that time in service, Hari. She said, "Hari, come here. We came from Australia, Singapore. We bought so many shirts for Ganpati Pule." He said, "Yes, Shri Mataji." Shri Mataji said, "How much were they?" He said, "Shri Mataji, I think 10-12 pounds each." "Look here, this doctor has got his shirt." She asked me, "How much you got it for?" I said, "Shri Mataji, it was 110 rupees." 110 rupees... like now in India we get a shirt for about 2500-3000 rupees. That was 40 years back, 110 rupees. That is like 1 pound or so. So damn cheap, and it looks like a silk shirt.

Every day when I used to go back, I had stories to tell my mother and father. So I told them Shri Mataji praised my shirt. But I would reflect, "Oh, Shri Mataji is talking to me about the shirt and the cost of the shirt, just like my grandmother talking." Later on, I understood that whatever she talks to you, whenever she is talking, she may be talking about anything, but it doesn't matter. What she is doing is clearing you and working on you. Talking about the shirt and the cost and "Hari, you come and what we bought"... the whole time, she was clearing me from inside. I couldn't understand. Later on, I started observing that Shri Mataji is talking, but her eyes are working on your body while talking.

The talk also changed as you started feeling vibrations and understanding Sahaja Yoga. A few years later, after this tea episode, when I had matured a little bit, say five to seven years later, in some conversation while telling some story, Shri Mataji told me, "You know, nobody eats in front of me." Then I remembered, oh, eight or ten years back, I was eating normally and drinking tea in front of her. That time she gave me more sweets to keep and told me to continue drinking. And today, she was telling me that nobody eats in front of her. So I understood that as you keep on maturing, as I was maturing, her way of talking and what she was talking about kept on changing as your level changed.

There was a time... at one time she wanted me to test Sir CP. She said, "You test Shri Mataji also. You test Shri Mataji for sugar." She didn't ask Shri Mataji directly. She told me, when they were all sitting in one place, I tested Sir CP and gave him some nebulizer or something. Then she said, "Okay, with a glucometer, you test her also." I was very enthusiastic, so I took the finger of Shri Mataji, wiped it off, and tried to do it, but it showed an error.

I looked at Shri Mataji. She looked at me. "Shri Mataji, something's gone wrong. Can I try again?" "Okay, do it." I did it again. Again, it was showing an error. Now all the Yuva Shaktis were staring at me. I got very nervous. I thought, "I did it for Sir CP, it was just a two-second job." It so happened I did it a third time. The third time also it showed an error.

Now, three times you have pricked Shri Mataji. I was totally nonplussed, just standing there. And Shri Mataji said, "Did you take my permission before pricking me? You have to put your hands to your ear, take my permission, and then you can do it. You are just taking my finger like that and pricking it. Who has given you that authority? How can you do that? Did you ask? You have to bow down to me, ask my permission. And once it has not come, you have to say, 'Mataji, I am sorry I could not do it. Please can you give me permission again?' like that. So now you do it."

I said, "Shri Mataji, I am very sorry. I didn't take your permission. If you permit, can I prick you? I am very sorry it will hurt you." She said, "No, no, no. It's okay, do it." Then I did it, and that time it was correct. So she said, "Look here. You should have recognition."

Now, this was around '90, '95. From '85 to '95, from taking tea and talking about shirts and watches, she changed. "Now you have to mature. You have to recognize. You have to ask for permission. You have to say sorry to me in case something goes wrong. Ask again for permission to do it again." Slowly, slowly, slowly she changed the way she would talk to you and expect things from you as you matured. But the bottom line is that she sees what level you are. Basically, she sees you are an okay person, has some seeking, some spirituality in your background, and then she slowly molds you into that. And as you mature, she takes you a little higher, and then she expects the whole protocol, the whole recognition. From a doer stage, you should come to the stage where you know Shri Mataji is the doer.

Host: That's a very good point how you have shown your journey from being a young doctor and having such normal conversations with the Adi Shakti to how she literally held your hands and told you the protocol. It's amazing to hear it. Will you please share some more details for the viewers who may like to know more about this?

Dr. Sandeep Rai: Yes, sure. One thing that she continuously did was that she never, even at times when she would get a little angry, let you go out of her attention. She knew that these young people are not so well-settled, and if I say anything harsh, they may just get washed off into the normal world. They would just go away. So she... and possibly she knew that there are certain people who can be molded. And so whether she was here or somewhere else, she never ever let her attention go.

When I would not go, she would ask. When my wife was called in service in Pratishtan later in 2007, even then she would ask, "How is your husband? Where is he? Why has he not come here?" My wife told her, "He is doing his work in Mumbai, so I have come to Pune." "So why hasn't he come?" "He didn't get leave." Then they would phone me. They would phone me, "Shri Mataji is asking for you." I would take the leave, just drive, a two-hour drive. When I used to go, she wouldn't talk much. I would do pranam, she'd say okay. And my wife would tell me, "Shri Mataji is asking about you," but when I come, she is not talking. Only seeing and working inside your body. That attention was always there.

Even when she was in the UK, through Sir CP I would get messages. Sir CP would call me if he would fall sick. He had some of the best doctors in the UK from Brompton Hospital, a very famous chest hospital in London. The professor of chest medicine was treating him. He writes books on chest medicine. And here in India, a young doctor like me was treating him. The best part was that when he used to go to the UK, I would write all his medicines, and the household people would buy them for six months and pack them. And in the UK, if he would get sick, he would call me and ask which medicines he should take. I'd say, "You should talk to your professor in the UK," but he would say, "No, no, no. You tell me."

That was the kind of faith he had. This happened because once he got a cough and was admitted to a big hospital near Qutub Ashram. A retired professor of chest medicine was seeing him. I was a young doctor. I used to go and see him with my father. One day I went with my stethoscope, I auscultated him, and I said, "Sir CP, I can hear crepitations over here. You have a small pneumonia patch here." He said, "But the professor of medicine has not told me." I said, "No, tomorrow he will come. You just tell him to auscultate here." The next day, the professor came, and Sir CP told him, "Sir, please see here." He said, "Oh, Sir CP, I have seen you enough times. Nothing is there. It will get okay in three, four days." He said, "No, do I have any patch here?" "Nothing is there."

The third day I went, I again auscultated him. I said, "Sir CP, you have a patch here." He said, "But the chest medicine professor has seen me twice and says no." I said, "Next day he comes, tell him to do an X-ray." He said, "He has already done one." I said, "Tell him to do one now. It's a patch now." So next day, the professor came and Sir CP insisted on an X-ray. The professor said, "Okay, for his satisfaction, do an X-ray." They did an X-ray and found a patch there. Then he changed the antibiotics, and he was okay. But Sir CP, after that, gained a kind of confidence.

Because of that, Sir CP started calling me almost every other day. Shri Mataji's house at Qutub was small, only two rooms. Mataji was always in the drawing room with seekers, and whenever you opened the door, you would find Shri Mataji. You'd bow down, and she would say, "How did you come?" "I've come to see Sir CP." "Okay, see him." And in the next room, I'll go sit with him, talk to him, auscultate him. He used to be very happy. When I'd come back, again, you have to pass Shri Mataji. She's sitting there. "So, what happened?" And then slowly, I would slip down and sit. Other people were talking, and I must have heard hundreds of hours of conversation. I remember only 10-15 minutes out of that. This was one of her plays to get me inside her holy darshan. And that was the time she cleared us.

I remember one time, like this, when Sir CP was there, I was sitting. And she said, "Where all have you people gone before coming to me? You have gone to all Guru Ghantals." I said, "Yes, Shri Mataji, we used to go to many saints and sages." And later on, we came in contact with a few of these tantric kind of people who would tell you things in advance. And she said, "Look here, who all are sitting inside you?" I said, "Shri Mataji, where?" She said, "Here, in your stomach area. Do you know who all are sitting there?" I said, "No, Shri Mataji." She says, "Come, come here." She moved me out in the front, and she put one foot on my stomach, like this. My hands were on the floor, and I was sitting. For about 20 minutes or so, she kept her foot pressed on my stomach and kept on talking to other people. She said, "So many of them are sitting, and these people don't know. And they go to so many saints and think they are becoming big spiritual people."

After 20-25 minutes, she took off her foot and said, "Okay, now it's much better." Then I understood what happens when you are doing all this and keeping all these negative things inside you. Only Adi Shakti could have understood that. At that time, I didn't find the significance. Later, I understood that I used to have many of the symptoms, like a kind of uneasiness, ghabrahat, many times missing beats. And these were the entities sitting inside and troubling me. And Shri Mataji blessed me with her holy feet.

She has done a lot for us. And that is the reason we are talking. I want to tell the people that it is not just me; she has done this for everybody. It may not be in person, but she is everywhere. And the best part is that she doesn't let you go out of her attention.

I remember one time in '95-'96, there was a big dengue fever epidemic in India. Nobody knew what it was. Shri Mataji was somewhere abroad, and she wrote a letter. She knew I was treating dengue patients, and she sent a full recipe for a medicine, the kadha which we call. She wrote, "It has to be made like this... and all people in this epidemic should drink it. And please tell Dr. Sandeep Rai about this." She has always had that attention. While in the UK, she knew this was happening in India and this has to be done.

There are many beautiful, heavenly moments we spent with her. Her generosity, her kindness, her patience... she was tolerating people who were totally worldly. We just wanted our career, wanted to grow, to get more degrees, more money, bigger cars, go to the US, be a noted doctor, get so many awards. These were the things we were longing for. And in the beginning, she used to talk about it. "You want to go to the US? I will send you." One time she said, "You work so hard, so sincerely, why don't you get so much name and fame?"

I said, "Shri Mataji, you are all-pervading, all-knowing. You are asking me why I don't get that much name and fame? You only know." She said, "Yeah, that is what I was thinking. Every day I see you come, you work so hard... you don't get Yash." Yash is fame.

So she sent me to a Sahaja Yogi astrologer. I thought, "Shri Mataji is sending me to an astrologer?" I went to a senior Sahaja Yogi, and he said, "Your Shani is the problem. Your Saturn is bad." He told me to do this and that, feed the pigeons. I didn't do anything, but I continued my work.

A few days later, I happened to again go to Qutub and had the good fortune of meeting Shri Mataji. I did my pranams, and she said, "What happened with the astrologer?" I said, "Shri Mataji, he told me my Shani is bad." She said, "Oh, Shani is bad. That is Saturn. Don't worry about this Shani and Mangal and all that. Shani is what? It is just your Vishuddhi. You clear your Vishuddhi, your Shani Devta will be very happy. He will be just pouring his blessings on you. After getting your realization, these things don't matter much. All these deities and all these stars... you clear your chakras, the deities are pleased, and your stars are pleased. So, leave all your Shani and all to me. Just continue your work."

I couldn't understand why she sent me to an astrologer when she is the all-knowing. Later, I thought maybe she wanted me to tell this to people. That when things are not going right, you will be compelled to try other streams like astrology or going to a tantric. People will tell you your Saturn is bad. Don't worry about these things. Instead, try to meditate more, clear your chakras. Each of these astronomical planets is represented by a chakra. If you please the deity and the chakra is cleared, you get above these planets. They cannot harm an awakened being. Maybe this message she wanted me to give to people who believe so much in astrology.

One fine day when we were sitting in Shri Mataji's house, she told me, "You go on the train tour tomorrow." I said, "What, Shri Mataji?" She said, "There is a train tour I organized, 600 foreigners. For 15 days the train will go to different spots in India. You go on the train tour with them." I asked, "When should I go?" She said, "Tomorrow the train is leaving. I want you to be with foreigners and see how deep they are."

My father was also there. I came down and said, "Papa, where is the train? How to go? I have no ticket, no clothes for 15 days. Where will I stay?" He said, "You stay in the train only. When Mother says it, everything is done." Next day morning, we packed the bags. By evening, we came to the station. A few Yuva Shaktis were standing there. "Oh, Dr. Sandeep, your seat is booked. You come with us." They took me to the last cabin. There were six of us in that compartment on wooden benches. One was Niku, who was doing the catering for all 15 days. Then there was Natraj, another old Sahaja Yogi. They gave me the work to sell Bisleri bottles for 10 rupees each. And they would take us to various temples on the way—Somnath, Dwarka, so many temples we visited.

After the train tour, which was in 1995, it would stop near Pune, and Shri Mataji would give a lunch to everybody. Then the buses would take us to Ganpati Pule. After Ganpati Pule, we met Shri Mataji there, and then she said, "Come to Kalwe for puja." After the New Year puja, she said, "Now you go to Pratishtan and stay there for 10-15 days. I'll teach you Sahaja Yoga."

She gave her own Contessa car. While going to Pratishtan, the driver, Odar, was overtaking a truck and miscalculated a little. His back bumper hit the truck. The car shook, but it went okay. A day later, Shri Mataji arrived and she called us. She said, "How was your trip?" "It was okay, Shri Mataji." "Anything happened?" Then I remembered. "Nothing much, Mother. The bumper hit the truck." "You all are safe?" "Yes, Shri Mataji, nothing happened."

Much later, when we went to Hyderabad, an astrologer came to my in-laws' house. He took my chart and he said, "Oh my God, the worst period you are going through. A few days back, a big accident was there. I am so surprised you are sitting here without any injury because this was destined to happen."

Shri Mataji gave her own car, her own driver, and in that period, didn't let me go back to Delhi where these things were due. She told me, "I will teach you Sahaja Yoga, go to Pratishtan." That whole month was so bad for me that she kept me there. Every day in the night, I used to go to her on the second floor in Pratishtan, and she would say, "Okay, we will talk about Sahaja Yoga. We will talk about chakras and diseases." I used to take my diary and a small tape recorder and record it.

One day, while I was recording, she suddenly said, "Look here, if you want to progress in Sahaja Yoga, you will have to recognize me." I said, "Shri Mataji, I recognize you. You are Adi Shakti." She said, "No, no, not for the word's sake. Do you recognize me?" I said, "Yes." She said, "No. You have to recognize. You saw how deep the foreigners are. Why did I send you on the train?" I said, "Yes, Shri Mataji, they have great faith in you, an unwavering faith." "So why don't you have it?" "No, I have it, Mataji." "No, why don't you have faith like them? Because I have given them some out-of-the-world experiences and I have given you none." "No, Mataji, you have given me small experiences." "No, I have given you good experiences, but everything you think is a coincidence."

"What did they tell you?" I said, "Shri Mataji, they told me many things. One lady told me that you were taking some program in London, and when she went to the stage to do pranams to you, she looked in your eyes, and in the black part of your eye, she could see the whole universe. She could see the planets moving, the sun, the stars, everything."

"What else?" "I said, one guy, maybe in the Royal Albert Hall, first time he had come, was sitting in the last seat. When you were talking, he saw a gray-colored cloud coming towards him, and it hit him. Then his Kundalini went up and hit the ceiling." Shri Mataji laughed so much. "And what else?" "I said, one gentleman saw you on the stage, and you started becoming bigger and bigger and bigger."

She said, "So now you believe?" I said, "I believe, Shri Mataji, but I don't have that kind of experience." She started smiling. "Experience you want. Something unmistakable, that after that experience, I should have no doubt that you are Shri Adi Shakti and nothing else."

It was night time, past one o'clock. We were on the second floor of Pratishtan. Shri Mataji was eating chanas. One side was a window with a view of the night sky. Nobody else was in the room. She was sitting, and I was sitting on the floor. She started looking towards the night sky. Suddenly, she turned her face and started looking directly into my eyes. Then I saw her eyes getting bigger and bigger and her face getting larger. I became like this... started shivering. And she said, "Okay, okay, okay, it's alright, it's alright." She turned her face again towards the sky. "Take water, take water. It's very late. Why don't you go and rest?"

I was totally dazed. I couldn't understand what had happened. I got scared. I was not prepared to take it. I was again and again asking her, "Shri Mataji, give me an unmistakable experience," and she tried to show some form of the Devi. At my stage, very young and unprepared, I was not developed enough to take that kind of experience.

This was the time when she cleared my Vishuddhi to start feeling vibrations. This is the time when she saved me. This is the time she told me about the foreigners who were very deep.

One more thing about the photograph. In Pratishtan, in '95, she told me, "I want to open a hospital in Pratishtan. I want you to go and take charge of it." I said, "Mother, me? It's a Sahaja Yoga hospital. What will a modern medical specialist like me do there? You should send some senior Sahaja Yogis." She said, "No, but I want you to go." Sir CP was sitting there. He said, "Mother, he is a young medical specialist. Why do you want to spoil his life by sending him there?" She said, "No, Sir CP, this is the real science. He is a specialist. That's why I want to send him. This is the metascience. This is the greatest science." She asked me, "Will you go or not?" I said, "Mother, I don't want to go. But if you insist, I will go." She said, "Yes, that is what I want to know. You will go." I said, "I will go."

She said, "Okay." She called Mr. Magdum's son. "You go with his son now, today only, see the apartment. See what changes you want and come back and tell me." I said, "Mother, how can I live in your apartment?" "That's not your business. What I am telling you, you just go." So this guy took me in his car to the health center. It was all barren. I saw the apartment. It was nice. We drove back to Pratishtan. Mother said, "What happened?" "Shri Mataji, everything is okay. But how can I stay there? Mr. Magdum was so angry. They have built it for you, Mother."

She said, "Why can't you stay? So many houses where I stayed, I have sold them. Other people are staying. My Lucknow house I sold, other people are living there." I said, "But, when you come to this health center, where will you stay?" "I will not come there."

I kept saying, "Mother, this doesn't look nice. How can I stay there?" I told her, "Better you call some senior person. I am not very good at vibrations. I am not very good at the Sahaja Yoga thing. You will send me there, I will sit behind the patient, I will do some clearing, and nothing is going to happen. People will laugh at me." She said, "You don't have to do anything. Why are you so worried? What you do is take my photograph. You give it to the patient. Sit at the back of the patient and just pray to me, 'Mother, please cure the patient.' And if the patient deserves to be cured, he will be cured."

I started smiling. "Shri Mataji, is it so simple?" She said, "Yes. If he deserves to be cured, he will be cured. You think you will be doing the curing? Who does it?" "Shri Mataji, you do it." "So, only saying, believe me. Just give my photograph." I said, "That's simple." So I said, "Shri Mataji, I will go." But she said, "I wanted your father, but he is saying that Delhi is the capital. If you make it in Delhi, it will be good." Finally, my father became the director. But at one time, she had given me the way to cure also.

A few days back, I was hearing a lecture where she was saying, "I was so worried after my Sahasrara opening, how can I go everywhere in the world and give realization? And then one fine day, when I saw my own photograph, I saw it was emitting tremendous vibrations. So, I understood that the work has to be done by my photograph." And then I remembered, many times while she was lecturing on stage, her photograph was also kept there. A yogi told me once when Shri Mataji was caught up with a lot of negativity, she kept her own photograph, and this yogi was clearing Shri Mataji with her own photograph.

She said, "This is the first time in the history of humanity that an incarnation has been photographed as live, with all its coefficients proper." She said, "My photograph has all the five elements. It is the light, the vibrations, everything it has. Plus, it has my desire." This photograph has the power to raise the Kundalini of a person. She gave an example of a house where the photos were not kept properly, people speaking nonsense in front of it. And the lady told Shri Mataji, "I pray in front of your photo." Shri Mataji said, "Bring the photo." And she saw the photo had blackened and had no vibrations. Then she said, "Purify it in running water. Take my good, vibrated photograph and keep it in a proper and respectful manner. Otherwise, this photo loses the vibration, and my attention goes away from there."

So, that first thing she told me in '95, "Give my photo"... what she meant by that, I understood 30 years later. The stories I've told are to make your faith stronger. That is the only purpose. The real part is meditation and propagation. You try to spread Sahaja Yoga; the more blessings you will get because then you are helping in her work. And the recognition of Shri Mataji as a whole. And the faith. There are so many stories about faith we will do some other time. I think whatever came to my mind is what Shri Mataji wanted me to speak. Thank you.

Host: Thank you so much for joining us this morning, Dr. Sandeep. It was really nice. Jai Shri Mataji. And thank you, Dr. Madhu Rai, for joining us as well. Dr. Sandeep has to go to his clinic. It's so nice listening to these beautiful stories. Would you please tell us how you got your realization?

Dr. Madhu Rai: For me, I came into Sahaja Yoga only after marriage. Ours was an arranged Indian marriage. My sister-in-law's maternal uncle was also my husband Sandeep's paternal uncle, so that is how the proposal came. When my brother got married, relatives had come, they saw me, and they informed my mother-in-law that they were looking for a girl for Dr. Sandeep.

My father-in-law was into Sahaja Yoga at that time, and he had come for a program at the IMA in Hyderabad. So we met at my sister-in-law's home, he saw me, and afterwards, they said, "Please come to Delhi." So my father and I went to Delhi. Sandeep came over, and we had the formal meeting.

My father-in-law wrote to my father, "Okay, we like the girl, but we are following a meditative process and we have our spiritual mother. She checks the vibrations, and only if the vibrations match will we get our son married to your daughter." So they asked us to go and meet the Sahaja Yogi leader in Hyderabad. My father and I went, and they gave us an introduction book. I don't remember getting my realization then. After that, a letter came from my father-in-law that Shri Mataji was coming to Hyderabad and we should go and meet her.

All the criteria I had for a boy to get married to were fulfilled. I was doing my graduation and I wanted a postgraduate doctor, and Sandeep was a postgraduate doctor. So now there's only one criterion to be fulfilled: to be approved by Shri Mataji. We went to Shri Rajeev Goel's home and were waiting for her. Shri Mataji's car came, and she had come back from puja. The first time I saw her, her lotus feet were all decorated. She looked at us, and we did our pranams. Then someone came and said that Shri Mataji had come back from puja and will rest now, so we should please come tomorrow.

The next day, we woke up at five o'clock and reached there by seven o'clock in the morning. We were waiting from morning until noon, and they were saying Shri Mataji is resting, she's tired. At one point, they said, "Please leave, we will inform Shri Mataji that you had come." My father was pondering what to do. I was telling my father, "Papa, they sent us over here, so we came. We did our dharma. Now let us go." But my father was a little reluctant. We were just standing in the hall, and suddenly we heard Shri Mataji's voice from upstairs. She was saying, "Dr. Rai's relatives have come. Please ask them to come up." Then we could hear Rajeev Goel-ji say, "Shri Mataji, but they have left. I just asked them to leave." "No, no, they are still down there. Please bring them up."

So he came running down the staircase and said Shri Mataji is calling you. That was the first time I realized her power because he was saying that they had left, but Shri Mataji was saying they are still there. We went up. I had finished my graduation, and my whole attention was on writing the post-graduation entrance exam. My father wanted me to get married. So the first thing I told Shri Mataji was, "Shri Mataji, you please make my father understand that I want to do my post-graduation and he insists that I get married." Shri Mataji listened to me and then she smiled and laughed. Then she told my father that the boy is good and he could get his daughter married.

It was an arranged marriage. One day, Sandeep wrote a letter saying, "I have no issues with your daughter, but I want to study further. I'm going to go abroad, and I don't know when I will return. Keeping your daughter waiting for me, I don't feel it is right. So if you find any suitable boy, you can get her married." For us, we could not decipher this because on one side they were saying yes, and on the other side, the boy says no. My parents started looking for other alternatives, but in my heart of hearts... I knew I had faith in Shri Shirdi Sainath, and if they are divine, it cannot happen that you say yes one day and then no another day. For me, it was that it will turn out to be a yes.

In our home, we had photographs of all gods and goddesses. When we went to Rajeev Goel's home, they had given Shri Mataji's photograph, so that was also framed and kept with all the deities. My father said that on a particular date, if we don't get a positive reply from Delhi, he will keep aside Shri Mataji's photograph. It so happened that on that date, it was turning to midnight, around 11:45 p.m., my father was discussing with my mother what will happen. Those days, we didn't have mobiles, only landline telephones. Around a quarter to 12, the telephone rings. I lift up the phone, and my mother-in-law is on the other end. She says that Sandeep has agreed to the match. Just before midnight, the telephone rang and this news was given to us.

So that is how Shri Mataji showed that she is divine. Then we came to Delhi and got engaged. After that, Sandeep had gone to Libya. He had spoken with Shri Mataji, saying he wanted to go abroad for further studies and didn't want to get married yet. Shri Mataji said, "I have told what I want to tell. Now it is up to him what he wants to do." Then he took a midway, got engaged, and went abroad. By Mother's grace, he returned, and we got married in 1993. The reception was in Delhi. My father-in-law went to invite Shri Mataji. She said, "You have not invited me for your son's wedding." My father-in-law was shocked. "Shri Mataji, it happened in Hyderabad." She said, "So what? I would have come."

For the reception, Shri Mataji came along with Sir CP, Sadhana Didi, and many foreigners also, because it was after the birthday puja. When Shri Mataji arrived, we went to pay our pranams. She looked at me and she said, "Are you happy now?" It was like... whatever I had been speaking to her photograph, it was like a dialogue. Then she said, "Send him to London." I said, "Shri Mataji, promise?" Then she said, "Promise."

I had a spinal issue, spina bifida, and it used to be very painful during my pregnancy. When we met Shri Mataji, she asked me, "Why do you fear? You yourself are a doctor, you have done so many deliveries." I said, "Shri Mataji, I have this pain in my back." She said, "Okay, sit down." She was sitting on the sofa, and she kept her lotus feet on my back. I started feeling warmth coming out from there. Then she said, "There's such a big gap because of this spinal condition." During pregnancy, the ligaments become loose, so the gap had increased, and I used to get tremendous pain. She gave me a cloth and said, "Make a gown of this and wear it during your delivery."

When I had my delivery, I had a painless delivery. The gynecologist used to be very scared because I was never very cooperative, but it so happened that during childbirth, I had a painless delivery. She started telling everyone, "She's having a painless delivery!" This was without any epidural anesthesia. Later, I read in my father-in-law's book, Medical Science Enlightened, that when the Kundalini rises to the limbic area, endorphins are released, and that is how you have painless experiences. So Shri Mataji started giving me experiences on my body.

My son used to get a lot of colds and coughs. Once, he had severe bronchitis, and my father-in-law told Shri Mataji, "Mother, we cannot come to Ganpati Pule because my grandson is not well." Shri Mataji said, "No, no, you bring them to Ganpati Pule." When we got on the train, the boy became alright. He was so sick, but on the train, this boy was completely alright. He was playing on the grass at Ganpati Pule.

In December 1994, Shri Mataji announced at Ganpati Pule that she was going to open the Vashi Health Center and that my father-in-law would be the first director. My elder son's first birthday was at Pratishtan. He learned to walk there.

I have a hot liver issue. One day, I had such bad knee pain that I could not bend it. The doctor said it was osteoarthritis. We went into service for Shri Mataji, and I was worried I couldn't even bow down. But I went, and I could bow down. The next morning, Shri Mataji asked me how I was. I said, "Shri Mataji, everything is fine, but my right knee..." She looked at me and she said, "It's the liver." She said, "Keep your right hand to me." My left hand, she made me keep first on my liver, then more down on my navel, then on my right Swadhisthana. As soon as my left hand went to the right Swadhisthana, a cool breeze flowed from my right hand. I had never felt anything like it. I just said, "Shri Mataji, it's flowing!" And as soon as I said that, it stopped.

She told me to meditate like that for two months, and after that, my pain went away. Whenever the right Swadhisthana is overactive, the pressure falls on the knees. For my hair, she vibrated coconut oil and gave it to me. Once she vibrated Jaba Kusum oil and said to mix it with coconut oil and apply it.

Shri Mataji took care of every small thing—children's birth, the wife's pregnancy, the naming of children. She named both my sons. The elder one, Devdutt, and the younger one, Niranjan. She named him at the airport. She said, "What's his name?" I said, "No name, Shri Mataji." She looked at him and said, "Niranjan."

She was very particular about protocol. Once she was wearing a red sari and looking so charming, you just wanted to go and hug her. I was just looking at her, and there were some flowers there with thorns on the leaves. She asked me, "Do you know what those flowers are?" I said yes. Then she said, "If you go near them, the thorn will prick." So, in a subtle manner, she explained that you have to follow the protocol, don't go too near.

Once my husband told Shri Mataji my parents were not praying to her, but to Balaji Bhagwan, Sri Venkateshwara. Shri Mataji said, "So what? He's a very strong deity. He's Sri Vishnu in that form." For new people, they might feel they have to differentiate, but Shri Mataji did not have any such thing. She loved each of them equally.

I used to wear a pendant of Shri Mataji and one of Shri Shirdi Sainath. Shri Mataji's pendant used to fall off. On and off, it used to fall off, but Shri Shirdi Sainath's pendant never fell. When my second son was born in 2000, as I was going for the delivery, the Shri Shirdi Sainath pendant fell on the pillow. From that time, Shri Mataji's pendant has never fallen. For me, it is like when your Guru Tattva becomes complete. It is like your school, then graduation, then you come to the university. It is a gradual transition, and it happens automatically.

Whatever is happening, once we are in Sahaja Yoga, Shri Mataji is taking care of us. We should have that complete faith. She will not allow you to put even one step in a wrong direction. So just have faith in Shri Mataji, and know that whatever is happening in your life, Shri Mataji is taking care of us. Follow your intuition. Meditation is very, very important. Taking bandhan, clearance, meditation, everything that Shri Mataji has spoken in her talks... all that is meant for each one of us.

Jai Shri Mataji.
