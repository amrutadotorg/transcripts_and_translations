To be a dust particle

I want to be like a dust particle
which moves with the wind.

It goes everywhere.

Can go, sit on the head of a king,
or can go and fall at the feet of someone.

And it can go and sit on a little flower,
and it can go and sit everywhere.

But I want to be a particle of dust.

That is fragrant,
that is nourishing,
that is enlightening.

Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, aged seven and as narrated by Her
in Dhulia, India, 14th January 1983
