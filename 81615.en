Here is the cleaned and formatted version of the transcript:

Top flat, number 56. We've got this mosaic look on the entrance there. So, maybe you could just tell us about this space?

So, here we are at Ashley Gardens, number 56. Mother's flat was on the very top, wasn't it? We went up in the lift. Do you remember, Dougie, all the work that was done here?

Oh, yeah, I can remember several times. One time in particular, I came here when Mother was away, and I came with a bunch of flowers. I said to Mr. CP, "She's coming back today, so will you take these to make sure there are flowers in the house?"

Another rather funny thing that happened with me, which I thought was strange at the time, was I bought some orchids—some slipper orchids—and I gave them to Mother because I thought they were really, really nice. I gave them to her, and she said to the servant, "Oh yes, go and put them in the toilet." And I felt a little bit disappointed at that. But then, two weeks later, when I came there, there were the orchids still in full bloom in the toilet. So, obviously, Mother knew something that I didn't. It was the right place for them to be. The right place for everything to be. Quite incredible.

One of the things I remember most—or two things—is I got two really nice, sort of ornamental bits of brass work from Shri Mataji here. She found out it was my birthday, and she just plucked something off the mantelpiece and gave it to me. Another time, I was feeling a bit sorry for myself, I think, and she just picked something else up and gave it to me. And I've got both of them.

We used to come here after meetings. She would invite us back from Caxton Hall and give us some food. Even the new people would come over from Caxton Hall, and we'd all go up there for a while. Yes, many, many times.

And then you had your wedding... well, even before that, we would stay here. At one point, when we were still at the Finchley Road Ashram, Mother said I had to leave the ashram to clear me out, and I was feeling particularly sorry for myself. I said to Mother, "So I have to go then?" And she said, "Yes, you have to go." And then she nipped over beside me and said, "We have to keep saying it like this, so that the negativity feels that you're gone." Then she nipped back in front of me and said, "So you'll be going then?" And I just said, "Yes, of course," because I felt completely that Mother was with me. It wasn't that I was being sent away; it was that the negativity had to believe I was out, me alone.

And like Pat said, every Monday for as long as I can remember, Mother would be in Caxton Hall, which is just a walk, really. Then we'd come back here. Sometimes she would go into McDonald's and have a fillet of fish and a Diet Coke. Or sometimes she'd send someone out, and they would come back festooned with McDonald's. We were sort of amazed that the Adi Shakti would eat McDonald's and drink Diet Coke from her straw.

One of my enduring memories is Mother saying she used to watch out of the window at the cathedral school there and watch the delivery lorries delivering casks and casks of beer and cases of whiskey for all the priests. For the cathedral. She was absolutely amazed that this was supposedly God's house, and it was just like a pub, really.

It was lovely, really comfortable. I remember as we used to walk in there, into the hall, the big wooden Ganesha was there. He was always there. That one came to Dollis Hill; we took it to Dollis Hill. And I remember scrubbing him down, putting him in the bath, and scrubbing all the kumkum off him to make him clean.

And we did spend our wedding night here. But before that, you have to remember after the wedding at Dollis Hill, Mother gave us a lift because all the buses had stopped. That was our first-year college exams the next day. And Mother said, "Would you like to come in?" We said, "Oh, we have exams tomorrow." She said, "Oh, you'd better go then." So we went back. She said, "So you came to the wedding even so." And she said, "Don't worry, you'll be all right. Don't worry, you'll be fine." And we were, eventually.

A little while after that, we were married and spent our wedding night here. There were two weddings going on, and the other family just whisked their couple away. Mother said, "So you two, what are you doing?" And we just didn't know. We just looked at her. "We don't know." "Come with me."

So we drove through London from Hampstead to here. We actually saw the dean of our faculty in the street, and we were all dressed as Indians. I had a massive turban on, which was Mother's sari, with one of Mother's brooches there. We were still tied together with the scarf, sitting in the back. Mother was in the front. We just saw this guy, and it was so surreal, the fact that this intellectual fool didn't know what was driving past him.

Then we came here, and Mother showed us into a room. She said, "There. You go there." We just sat there on the bed, still tied together, for what must have been two or three hours. Eventually, we crept out and could hear some sort of noise. Mother was in the lounge watching the telly. It was a Bette Davis film. And Mother said, "You must watch this. She's really good." After that, she took our scarf off. She said, "Oh, no need for this," and she untied us. The next morning, we had breakfast with CP, and she told him we'd been married. He was very pleased. He said, "Oh, thank you for staying. It's very auspicious to have you here."

On that day, we went to pick the keys up for the ashram in Stockwell because Mother said it was auspicious for a newly married couple. So we went there, and we were the first people in there when it was ours. It was Lynn's, actually, but it was a proper ashram.

It's a big, lovely, luxurious flat on the fourth floor. And it afforded creative views for Mother over the delivery lorries delivering all the beer and the whiskey. She actually wanted to put a staircase up on the roof and build a kind of roof area, but of course, the boring English wouldn't hear of it.

The lift... there's a central lift there that goes all the way up. One day I came to see Shri Mataji and the lift came down and the doors opened. I realized I was looking at Mother below my eye level. It was the first time—and I had known her for several years—I realized she was shorter than me, because she always seemed so immense. It was the only time in my life I ever realized that. It's extraordinary.

I actually did spend quite a lot of time in there doing bits and pieces. I remember as you go in the hall, you go through the door and to the right, there's a large double cupboard with two mirrors on it. The outside of the mirrors was decorated with hand-carved woodwork, which came from India. She gave me all these pieces of woodwork to put on. I sort of fiddled around with them for a little bit, and then I realized it was just enough to go around these cupboards. It was quite amazing. So I decorated the outside of these cupboards, and then I went out and bought two huge glass mirrors and put them on it. It was a coat cupboard, so when people were going out, they could see what they looked like.

Next to the cupboard, there was a Ganesha. I remember Mr. CP used to touch his feet when he'd go out. It was a big dark wooden carved one, the one that went to Dollis Hill. It was beautiful, not quite ebony, but very dark wood. And in here, Mother actually gave me a Ganesha which I've still got, a tiny little jade Ganesha. She said, "There, it's broken. You might fix him." And where his hand was up, the hand was broken off. So I got some superglue—and I've never had superglue work before—but it worked, and it's still there 30 years later. It's still on the altar.

Inside, Shri Mataji's houses were always the same. They were very lush, comfortable. Beautiful, embroidered carpets were laid everywhere all over the floor. She'd always get nice chandeliers. There was always lots of light. The furniture was quite ornate. All along the terrace, there were glass doors that could have opened out onto the staircase. There was the long room that was the dining room and the long room that was the living room, both on the front. Mother made false ceilings to put all the luggage and things she needed to put away. She said it was a waste of space in some areas, so she'd make a false ceiling and create a space to store stuff.

Do you remember the kitchen? When we went down to that place to see those people who were supposedly all spiritualists, Mother went in the kitchen and she made sandwiches for all of us to take with us. We went down there because we'd been invited by that guy who came to the meetings. We were all terrified, and Mother said, "Right, you've got to be really prepared for this. These spiritualists, they're working with spirits and all this." We went down there, and they all turned out to be realized souls. They were all amazing. We had a wonderful time and we all ate these sandwiches in the car going down. It was brilliant.

Well, I wasn't involved in Ashley Gardens quite so much as everyone else because I was in trouble. I got sent out. Well, not sent out. She just said, "You're caught up and you're affecting the others. I think you ought to really go out and be separate for a while. But I don't really want you to go out there on your own. You might get lost." And I said, "No, I won't. Don't worry, I promise I won't get lost."

For people who are listening to comprehend why Mother said that to you... well, I'd just come not long out of the drug scene and had been a squatter in London, living on Mars bars and amphetamines, among other things. I was in a terrible state. She gave me six months to live when I arrived. I was hardly in the real world anymore, but that was partly why I saw all these things in Shri Mataji when I came. I got a bedsit around the corner from the ashram at Finchley. I wasn't supposed to mix with the yogis. I was supposed to stay away. It was only a few months, and then I moved back into Dollis Hill.

I was doing an art college course, an interior design course, so I was busy and focused on that. But I remember I got flu and was really ill. Towards the end, as I was just getting better, I got it all over again, so I had flu twice in two weeks. That was when Shri Mataji said, "Really?" because I was just hanging around the ashram in a dreadful condition. I was 26 or 27 when I met Shri Mataji.

I was just remembering how we would come here sometimes, and especially the girls were very privileged in that they would get to sleep in Shri Mataji's bedroom. I can remember one incident where another yogini and myself were there, and Shri Mataji said, "Lie down on the bed, lie down. Sleep now, sleep now." This other yogini lay on one side, and Shri Mataji apologized to me because she said she always sleeps on her right side, so she had her back to me. I said, "Really, that's fine." I lay down, and afterwards she said, "Maureen, are you there?" I said, "Yes." She said, "Where are you?" I didn't dare cuddle up to her. I was just, "I'm here, Mother." She said, "Where are you?" I sort of inched a bit nearer and just lay there and relaxed. I just couldn't let go of the fact that it was okay to be in such a space. Later in India, we heard how if anybody laid on Shri Mataji's bed who was unauthorized, they'd be thrown off the bed by the deities. It was as if I was growing up a tiny bit and stopped feeling like the little baby that could do whatever.

So, where's the next place we're heading to now?

Caxton Hall. It's just across the road. When Shri Mataji said we should do a big public program, we looked everywhere. I don't remember how we found Caxton Hall as the right place, but we told Mother, and she said to go ahead. The great thing about Caxton Hall is it had many different rooms in it. The only one I can definitely remember is the Great Hall. About once a month we'd get the Great Hall and do a big public program. We actually advertised the very first one in Time Out.

It was quite a fair-sized hall. We made such a mess of it that Bogdan said the only reason he came was that he thought anyone who made such a mess of an advert must be regular people and not publicity types.

These events were on every Monday. They started in October 1977 and must have gone on for several years. When Mother went to India for about three months, from January to March, obviously they'd stop. It's extraordinary to think that she came every single Monday. It was just a fixed event. As I say, once a month we'd have the Great Hall and do another big publicity drive, and it would always be packed, absolutely packed.

Mother would see everybody in the hall. She'd give a talk. There was one day when Gregoire decided that he would announce who Shri Mataji was. He gave a big talk, and then, in his own way, he paused and very slowly pronounced her to be the Adi Shakti. Mother said that for some people it went one way and for other people it went the other way, and it was all too much for them. But we were expecting them all to go, "This is it! We found her!" And they were just sitting there as usual.

Even at one of the Caxton Hall meetings, some lady stood up and said that she was the Adi Shakti. Shri Mataji had been going around and seeing everybody, and it so happened she was standing in front of Mother when she said it. Shri Mataji just looked at her and said, "Really? Go and do your own meetings." And she left. It's just extraordinary that people were so blind. They would come, they'd get their realization, they'd go, and then a new lot would come and get realization and go, and then a few, few would hang on.

That's Caxton Hall. This is a fairly typical Victorian-built municipal building, which is in private hands now. This is where Mother used to have public meetings every Monday for years and years and years. This is where I met Mother, just after Easter of 1979. She came in, and it wasn't the Great Hall; it was one of the smaller halls. I was sitting at the front. Mother gave a talk, and she used to come and work on people individually. Mother came down and was saying things like, "I don't know who's in you," and, "Did you feel it?" Maureen had brought me to meet Mother, and she was nervously standing behind me, saying, "This is him, Mother, this is him." And Mother said, "He's all right." That was it. That was fine. That was as much approbation as I would ever need.

Caxton Hall is a magnificent building. It was well known in the 60s especially because it was the registry office. So lots of celebrities—pop stars and film stars—were married there. You would always see them on the newsreels coming out of Caxton Hall.

This was where we did the first ever public meeting. Over the years, we probably used all of the meeting rooms. As Maureen said, once a month, we used to have the Great Hall, which was the biggest one. It's magnificent Victorian municipal architecture. All the rooms were wood-paneled with lovely parquet flooring. Mother loved that sort of thing, the quality build of things.

It was sort of the same format. Mother would talk, introduce herself. She would talk about Sahaja Yoga, about whatever subject she wanted to talk about. She would raise everyone's Kundalini, and then she would come in between us and walk up and down the rows, working on people and working on the chakras, actually raising their Kundalini individually. Thinking back, it's astonishing. That's an awesome thing to do, to be part of, to be a witness to. And she was very, very gentle with everyone. Sometimes she wasn't happy with some of the Sahaja Yogis, but she was very, very gentle with all the new people. Lots of new people came through. It's a lovely, lovely memory.
