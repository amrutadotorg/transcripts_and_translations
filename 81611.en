To all the viewers who have joined us today for the first time, this is the second program in this series wherein we are trying to capture Avdut Shankar's experiences, or the time that he has spent with Mother. The session will include a short meditation, a Q&A, another small meditation, and then we will conclude.

Jai Shri Mataji, uncle. We will start with a small meditation.

Meditation

Jai Shri Mataji. Can we all just raise our Kundalini and put ourselves in bandhan?

And just put our right hand on the heart. Say a small prayer:

"Mother, let your holiest of all holiest names be always in my heart. Please forgive me if I have offended you in any way through my thoughts, words, or deeds. And make me aware of it. Please give me the courage to forgive others as you have forgiven me. Let your divine vibrations teach me to love others and not have a feeling of malice or hatred for anybody. And last, but not the least, I'm thankful, I'm really grateful for all that you have done for me. And I pray that your blessings will keep showering on this ignorant child forever and ever. Amen."

Very slowly, raise your right hand above the head. Take it as far back as possible. We do it three times. And we'll just tie a bandhan. Keep our eyes closed and put our attention on the Sahasrara. Keep it there for some time.

Let's end this small meditation with a prayer to Shri Mataji:

"Shri Mataji, kindly make us good instruments of the divine, so that the divine can play beautiful notes on the flute of our body. Please give me this hollowness, complete surrendering, complete oneness with your cosmic body."

Jai Shri Mataji.

Host: Jai Shri Mataji, uncle. That was a beautiful meditation. To everyone who is joining us for the first time, this is a series of sessions that we're doing with Avdut uncle. This is the second session in that series. The link to the first session can be found in the description of the video you're watching right now. You can also find it on our channel, which is Sahaja Yoga Online Meditation. Jai Shri Mataji to everyone.

Uncle, like the last time, I would like to start with some photos. Mayank, is it possible to put up the remainder of the photographs that we had?

Avdut Shankar: This photo was taken in 1978 on Marve Beach near Mumbai. As I told you last time, we used to go there quite often. Shri Mataji told some Sahaja Yogis to spend a weekend there, and suddenly, she also joined us. As I told you before, Shri Mataji always used to crack jokes and make us laugh. This was one of the photos which I got as a present from one of my brothers and sisters from abroad.

This was in Rahuri in 1983. This was Dumal uncle with Shri Mataji.

Host: Uncle, I've heard that Mother had spent a lot of time in Rahuri. Were you able to attend those sessions?

Avdut Shankar: Yes, yes. This was in '83, but I was there in '79 also. I don't exactly remember how many times I had been there, but previously, the Maharashtra tours used to start from Rahuri. Dumal uncle used to live near the station of Rahuri, and Shri Mataji used to come and stay with him. At least when I was there, she was staying with him.

Host: Mayank, we'll go to the next photograph.

Avdut Shankar: At that time, as I told you, Shri Mataji used to give us the possibility of taking photos with her. This is one of the photos. In the next one, Shri Mataji had kindly allowed us, brother and sister, to take a photo with her.

Host: Is that your sister, uncle?

Avdut Shankar: Yes. She is Meenakshi from the UK. I got married in '85 and she got married in '83. And since then, she has been staying in the UK, in London.

Host: She is your real sister? Was the entire family Sahaja Yogi?

Avdut Shankar: Yes, yes. We were just two.

Avdut Shankar: This photo I got as a present from Warick uncle, whom I told you about. When I came to France, we were very close. It was a really close-knit family. This is one of the three photos which existed at that time, which was on the passport of Shri Mataji when she went to the UK for the first time in December '73. One of them was given to Warick uncle, and he gave me his own photo. In those days, you could not make copies and all that, so he gave me his own. Later on, I made a digital copy so that everybody can see it.

Avdut Shankar: This was in 1990 in the Montfermeil Ashram in Paris. Shri Mataji was giving Indian names to the Western Sahaja Yogis, and I used to write down those names. She used to even tell the meaning of the name.

Host: Why would she give Indian names to Western Sahaja Yogis?

Avdut Shankar: She used to give names which corresponded very much to that person. For example, a very elderly lady in Toulouse, in the east of France, was sort of the first one there. Shri Mataji gave her the name Adya. Adya means "the first one," the primordial. Then she used to give names... like somebody is called Mayank, starting with M. For some reason, these names obviously corresponded to the person.

For example, there is one Sahaja Yogi in Paris, and Shri Mataji gave him the name Kabir. His name is Ronan, R-O-N-A-N, and he used to play a lot of music. He wrote a lot of poems and songs on Shri Mataji. So he was like Kabir, so Shri Mataji gave him the name Kabir. All these names which Shri Mataji gave had some meaning; it was not just by chance. Let me tell you, whatever happened with Shri Mataji, though we thought it was just by chance—like in France we say par hasard—no, nothing was by chance. You will see afterwards, nothing was left to chance. Everything was very well organized: who should come in front of her, what should happen, everything was decided.

Host: Decided in the sense, who would decide?

Avdut Shankar: It would be the divine planning. It would just happen. In 1988, at the Sahasrara Puja in Italy, Shri Mataji said that it was decided in the heavens before she came down on the earth. She gives full detail of what was decided; you can listen to that talk. Not only that, but you will see later on who has to come in front of Shri Mataji, who should not come—everything is decided. Of course, it's Adi Shakti who decides finally.

It's very easy to understand. If a president from a very small country goes to another country, before he lands there, all his spies, all his people with snipers go there to see if the place is safe for his protection, for his guidance. Everything is taken care of. Should he shake hands? Should he say namaskar? Everything is taken care of. So if this could happen with a president of a small country, when Adi Shakti comes on earth, everything is being taken care of. And everything she says, everything—I wouldn't say desires—but her vision, it will be there.

Just to give an example, Ganapatipule started in December '85, but three or four years before, she was already talking about Ganapatipule. And the first marriages started in that place we saw the photo of last time, Nirambar, in '78. And Shri Mataji had already started talking in '73, '74 about these marriages. So her vision is completely clear. Everything is sort of arranged. Now, our only job is to become good instruments in her hands.

Host: Yes, uncle. Thank you so much for explaining that.

Avdut Shankar: Yes, this was in Delhi from the 10th to the 16th of February, 1979, in a place called 10 Ashoka Road. I think these were all the men. There are some from Delhi. I'll just mention it quickly. Sitting on the left is me. On my left is Vinod Gopalan uncle, whom you must be knowing. Then on his left is Rai, then there is Mr. Singh. Then there is one Mr. Verma, about whom I told you last time regarding the sweater, who is sitting at Shri Mataji's feet on her right-hand side. On the left-hand side of Shri Mataji is Mr. Subramaniam. Then there is Mr. Pule and Mr. Mathur. Behind Mr. Mathur is Uncle Gregoire. Then there is Lindsay. The small boy is Anand, and on the right-hand side of Shri Mataji is Anand's sister, Sonu.

Standing from the left is Ganeshan, Uncle Gavin. Then there is a very great Sahaja Yogi who recently passed away, I don't remember his name. Then you can see the tall man, he is from Australia but living in Russia. Many people you might not be knowing. Extreme right is Rustam, with the beard. Dr. Bogdan, yeah, that's the name I was searching for. The person who is seventh from the left, with the mustache, is Dr. Bogdan. A very great Sahaja Yogi.

This is the photo of the yoginis. Some of you must be knowing. You can see Rustom's wife on the left-hand side of Shri Mataji. Then there is Chhaya sitting second from the left. I think there is Jane.

Host: This picture was at Delhi, right, uncle? Was this for some puja?

Avdut Shankar: Yes, just after the puja. We were staying together from the 10th to the 16th of February at 10 Ashoka Road. In the morning time, there was a pandal and it was sort of free. In the evening time, around 6:30, we used to have a public program until 11:00 or 11:30 at night. This was in 1979. I just wanted to mention also that the first time Shri Mataji caught me smoking, she said, "Did you smoke?" That was in the year 1976, on the 5th or 6th of February.

Host: Thank you. There are a lot of vibrations in the photographs, uncle. Just sitting with my hands open, I can feel the tremendous flow.

Avdut Shankar: Very true.

Host: Okay, uncle, we'll start with our Q&A session. The last session ended with multiple experiences that you shared. This time, I'll ask certain questions that I had in my mind, and then you can recall and share anything with everyone who's watching. First and foremost, I wanted to ask you if Mother was able to tell or judge if something was going on in your mind without you even telling her.

Avdut Shankar: Yes. Two very strong instances happened. In '78, I told you I was in Nirambar, and I used to take care of the money for shopping and newspapers. I used to go with the cook to buy vegetables and all those things. At that time, we had some yogis from abroad, and Shri Mataji told me, because I was fully available, to take them to different places like museums, Elephanta Caves, and to see some films, so that they would not be bored. I took them everywhere, and there were something like eight or ten of them. It was rather hot, at least for the foreign Sahaja Yogis, and they used to feel thirsty and go to restaurants to drink Limca.

For some reason, some of them thought that everything was free. While going out, they never had the habit of paying for their Limca. The restaurant fellow used to tell me, "These two people have not paid." At that time, Limca was 50 paise. I used to pay from my pocket; I was a student and just had my pocket money. Then I told my father that all my pocket money was going on this Limca. He said, "No, no, no, you should not ask them for money. Let them not pay. They are like guests, they are our gods." So I shelled out quite a lot of money from my pocket.

In '79, when the Sahaja Yogis from abroad came, everybody had some other role to play, and nothing was given to me. I was quite surprised. Then I realized that the leader at that time had spread some rumors or something, saying that I had pocketed some collective money or had not kept the accounts properly. I felt like laughing. In fact, the reality was just the opposite.

Then there was a public program in Borivali. Shri Mataji told us to go to Marve beach, where we saw the photo. She said, "Avdut and some other Sahaja Yogi will take care of you." And then she said, "Avdut, you should not spend anything from your pocket money." She told them, "Avdut has spent a lot of money from his pocket. Don't allow him to spend money from his pocket. They've got a lot of money; they will pay for their expenses." It was like she was giving a clean slate to me, saying that it was just the opposite. So many people were there. From that time, I knew that whatever you do, if it's clean, at some other time, it will certainly come out.

The second time was at Mahakali Puja in '82, in Lonavala. My father was taking care of all the financial aspects, and I was helping him. There was a bag with all the money inside. My father said, "Go and count how much we got." I think the puja was on, but I was doing that. When the puja finished and we came back, the bag of money was gone. I was really disturbed. My father, one uncle from Bombay, and I went to inform Shri Mataji. She was in another bungalow, sleeping, and somebody was massaging her feet. We didn't want to disturb her, so we just stood in front of her door, prayed to her, and came back. Everybody was quite surprised about who could have taken the money. My father said, "No, we have told Shri Mataji, and she will take care of it."

I could not sleep very much, but anyway, we slept. In the morning when I got up, I saw that the money was back there. It seems that some yogi had some ill ideas and then he gave back the money. So just to tell you, even if you tell her in front of the photo, it's as effective as when we tell her physically. Sometimes when we tell her physically, our connection with her is not there.

Host: I wanted to know if there is any instance that you would like to share wherein Mother would show her love for her children.

Avdut Shankar: Oh, so many times. Last time I told you about meeting Shri Mataji in the lift and my head being hot. But one instance I remember very much; it's so hard to forget. In Bombay, we used to get milk from Aarey Milk Colony. Once they were on strike, and I had to go to Shri Mataji's house to give some things. At about 10 o'clock, they had somehow gotten some milk from a private source where they had cows or buffaloes. It was a very small amount.

About 10 o'clock, they were drinking their first tea. It was a small cup, I don't know if it was even half full. I was just sitting on the ground, and Shri Mataji put half of it in the cup saucer and gave it to me. I cannot tell you what I felt. I was not very fond of tea and said, "No, Shri Mataji, I don't want it." She said, "No, no, take it," and she gave me half of that. It showed how much she really loved us from her heart. I mean, she loved all of us, not just me. She gave love exactly the same to all of us.

Secondly, I once wanted to learn judo. I bought the kimono, the dress they wear. I was with Shri Mataji and said I wanted to go to my judo classes. She said, "Judo classes? No, no, no. Judo spoils the chakras. No judo." I said, "But I've got this kimono." She used to say, "Throw that kimono in the sea." She said, "You can do exercises if you want, but no judo." These are very small instances where Shri Mataji helped us to understand many things.

Host: How she corrects her children... you hear about drinking and smoking, but judo is a new thing. Is there anything else she said no to?

Avdut Shankar: You mean physical exercises?

Host: Yes, anything she said no to, like gymming? I'm just asking for guidance.

Avdut Shankar: I told her I was doing gym, because you must be knowing in Bombay there was Samarth Vyayam Mandir, a very famous gymnasium in Dadar. She said a gym you can do, but judo, no. For other things, like for my mother, she had told her to walk barefoot on the ground every morning. There is also another talk I recently saw where Mataji says walking is good for Sahaja Yogis. But to my knowledge, judo, karate, and all these violent things could really affect our chakras.

Host: Moving ahead, uncle, is there any specific example you would like to quote where Mother corrected a yogi or any of her children?

Avdut Shankar: Yes. In '78 or '79, I don't remember the year, we were on a tour, and a yogi from Australia had joined us. He did not know anything about Sahaja Yoga, so I used to sit in the car and tell him all the mantras and everything. Shri Mataji told us she would give public programs in Maharashtra, so we were rather close. When he went back, he returned with 40 Sahaja Yogis from Australia, which had never happened before. He went north, south, east, and west to spread Sahaja Yoga in Australia. He was very close to us and had taken a liking to our family, coming to our house and all that.

The next time he came, he asked what he should bring for us. We told him to bring a "head" for the tape recorder—the main part on which the tape moves. When the tape moves a long time, the head gets less efficient, and we did not get that part in Bombay. So we had to get it from abroad. My father also had a camera and did not have a flash, which was separate at that time. So he said, "Bring me a flash." When the yogi came, he brought the flash, cassettes, the head, and all those things. When we asked how much we had to pay, he said, "No, no, no, this is a present from me." We really didn't want to take it as a present.

I told Shri Mataji, "Please tell him to take the money." Shri Mataji asked, "What did he bring?" I told her all the things. I still remember we were coming back from Bordi, and he was on the train. Shri Mataji was so angry with me. She pulled my ears, literally, and said, "You're doing business in Sahaja Yoga? It's not a business. Sahaja Yoga is not a business. Throw everything in the sea." That time, I pulled my own ears in front of Shri Mataji and said, "Shri Mataji, you can throw everything, but this head, we don't get it in Bombay." She said, "Okay, you can keep the head, but don't keep the other things. Give them back to him." And we gave them back. Sahaja Yoga is not a business. This is something she really told us.

Host: A lot of times we hear that deities tend to work for Mother. Is there any specific example where you experienced this yourself?

Avdut Shankar: Yes. There was one Mr. Iyengar, a civil engineer in the US. When he came to India, he gave some cards to Sahaja Yogis. On the card was his name and then his rates, like "giving realization $1," "curing something $2," something like that. People felt it was a bit bizarre and started having a headache.

I don't know if they told Shri Mataji or not, but we were in Prabhadevi, on the fourth floor of Kalpana Devi's apartment. We were all sitting there, and people were trying their level best for him to go with Shri Mataji to Delhi. Anyway, he was there, and we were talking. Suddenly he said, "Shri Mataji, it's so difficult to get you on the telephone. It's easier to contact Indira Gandhi than to contact you." It was insulting.

Suddenly, the atmosphere became very tense. Mody uncle, who is six feet tall, got up and said to this Mr. Iyengar, "One more word from you and I'll throw you out of the window." Shri Mataji was there in front, and he said it in such a tone that I think he meant it. We were on the fourth floor. So this Mr. Iyengar just got up, said, "Bye-bye, madam," to Shri Mataji, and went away.

The atmosphere became less tense, and Shri Mataji said that Shri Hanuman had spoken through Mr. Mody. This fellow, Iyengar, went to some place in the jungles of Orissa. As I told you last time, the real yogis in the jungles all know Shri Mataji. He met one of them, a real one, and told him the story. This yogi said, "Do you know whom you insulted? You insulted Adi Shakti. Go and ask for forgiveness." So he felt so repentant, cut all his hair, became bald, and came to say sorry to Shri Mataji.

The first time he tried to meet her at the airport, there was a taxi strike, and he could not arrive at the correct time. The second time, which never happens, Shri Mataji went inside just five or ten minutes before he arrived. Just when she entered, he came, so he missed her. The third time also, something happened. And then Shri Mataji said, "Because he insulted me, Hanumana will see to it that he will never come in front of me." This is something which is difficult to understand, but it happened.

Host: So you were not able to meet Shri Mataji where the deities essentially worked towards rooting out someone negative. Is there any specific example where the deities actually worked to get someone to meet Shri Mataji?

Avdut Shankar: Yes. On June 9, 2003, Shri Mataji was in Cabella. My wife had a good opportunity to be in Shri Mataji's company for some time. One day at two or three o'clock in the morning, Shri Mataji wanted to contact me, but somehow they could not. So the next weekend I went there on Friday and said, "In case Shri Mataji wants me, I am here till Monday."

That night, I had gone out for some castle work with an elderly Sahaja Yogini. We came back about 10:30 at night. It was pitch dark, but in front of the castle, it was very light. I told this elderly lady, "You sit here and I will open the big door from inside." I knew how to go. I went through the big staircases and was about to go up when I heard some music, some Bhimsen Joshi. When I peeped a little bit, I saw Shri Mataji and Sir C.P. on the right-hand side, listening to this music. Shri Mataji was busily listening, but when she saw me, she looked at me. I just came out and thought, "At least you should do Namaskar." So I did Namaskar.

Shri Mataji called me. I went there, and she appreciated some things. At that time, somehow, words came out of me: "Mother, please get well." In Marathi, we say, "Shri Mataji, bare vha." Shri Mataji replied, "Mi barich ahe," which means, "I am well." I said, "Mag harkat nahi," which means, "Then it is okay."

Then, we were in the kitchen, and Shri Mataji sent a word through a yogi. She said, "Tell the yogis not to worry about my health. I am working out something." This is a very important thing you have to remember: "I am working out something." All those things which happened, you have to see from that light. Who can come in front of Shri Mataji? What can we offer to her? Nothing is by chance. Everything is being planned right from the beginning. I always say, do not believe what you see. Shri Mataji is much, much more than what you physically see.

Host: Mother would often talk about her presence in the collective. Any specific example where you felt her presence?

Avdut Shankar: We were in Rahuri, just four of us: Shri Mataji, Rustom's wife, one yogi, and myself. This would have been in '78 or '79. There were some 30 or 40 yogis from abroad who were staying about 25-30 kilometers away. In the evening, Shri Mataji said to the yogi who was organizing, "Bring them here. Bring all of them here. Don't keep them far away." I heard Shri Mataji ask him at least three times. Somehow, he did not bring them.

The next day, we realized that they thought Shri Mataji was coming there for a sakar puja. They had prepared everything. Shri Mataji was with us, physically. Because Shri Mataji did not come, and at that time there was no mobile phone or anything, they did a nirakar puja. Then I realized that Shri Mataji, though physically with us, was spiritually with them, with the collective. So, whenever we are meeting collectively, Shri Mataji is there.

Host: Mother would often say that she would work upon the chakras of yogis during public programs. Any specific instance?

Avdut Shankar: Yes, when Shri Mataji used to do public programs, many times she said, "I take you all on my Kundalini and raise my Kundalini." Once in Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, she told me to put my hand on her Agnya, behind, to take out the vibrations. When I put my hand, it was like a big generator moving. At one point, I could hardly keep my hand there; the vibrations were just flowing out with a tremendous speed. So, Shri Mataji really works with her chakras on our Kundalinis to give us realization.

Host: Mother would often talk about attention, that her attention is pure attention. Any specific instance where you saw this working?

Avdut Shankar: Yes, her attention is very different from ours. At the Mahakali Puja, Shri Mataji said, "You should value your attention as I value my attention. You should value your attention much more than me because I can work out many things with my attention." On this point, I would say to yogis: don't put your attention on useless things, wasting time, like all those new things which have come up—I don't even know the names—Twitter, Instagram, FaceTime, WasteTime. All those things really take our attention away.

A small thing about her attention: we were in Delhi in 1979 at Ashoka Road. Once, Shri Mataji had a lot of pain in her left ear. She called me and another gentleman inside. Rustom's wife was putting oil. She was literally in pain; you could feel it was very painful. At that time, the public program was to start at 6:30. At 6:25, somebody came and said, "Shri Mataji, people have come out in the pandal." Shri Mataji told us both to go out.

Literally five minutes later, she came out fully ready for the public program. I was quite perplexed. I thought, "Did Shri Mataji have the pain? Or did the pain go away just like that?" It worked in my head for two years. In '81, I still remember we were on a train somewhere near Rahuri, and I asked her this question. She said, "Yes, my pain was there." During the public program for three or four hours, there was not a single sign of pain on her face or anywhere. She said, "When I go to the public program, when I give realization, my attention is not on my pain. It is on the people. So if my attention is not there, that thing does not exist for me." This is something which is difficult to understand, but it really helps.

Wherever she puts her attention, it works. When I was passing my B.Sc., I was trying to get a first-class degree. Out of 600, first class is 360, and I got 339. Twenty-one marks were missing. I was in the NCC, for which I could get 10 marks, and 8 marks were grace marks, so I could get 18 marks. Basically, I missed my first class by three marks. I wrote a lot of letters to Shri Mataji at that time, and I told her I just missed it. Shri Mataji closed her eyes and said, "Why didn't he get his first class?" I didn't even get my 10 marks from NCC.

So I went to this gentleman at Bombay University. I was the head of NCC in my college. To make the story short, on the fourth day, he said, "You will get your first class because there is some rule in which you fit exactly." He went to the vice-chancellor himself and got my first class. I got that handwritten mark sheet. So just to tell you how Shri Mataji works. When she came back, she told me that she had put her attention on it. In many villages, she used to tell me to share this incident with others.

Since that time, I perfectly believe that whenever we have something which is not allowing us to be in our thoughtless state, we should write it on a letter, put it at Shri Mataji's feet, and just keep it there. After 10 days, I would bury it or send it to the sea or river.

Host: I wanted to touch upon two slightly emotional topics, uncle. I just wanted to know, when your worldly mother passed away, how did Shri Mataji help you?

Avdut Shankar: My worldly mother passed away in May '84. In '83, my sister was with Shri Mataji, taking care of her bags. Myself and my father were on the tour buses. But Shri Mataji told my mother, "You should not come on the tour. You be at home." Then in January '84, suddenly one night, two Sahaja Yogis came from the tour and said, "Shri Mataji wants Mr. and Mrs. Pai on the tour the very next day." So both of them went. Shri Mataji said to them, especially to my mother, "You can come on the tour, but never come in front of me physically."

This was in February. At the Shivaratri Puja, my mother came in front of Shri Mataji, and Shri Mataji really did not like it and scolded her very much. My mother felt very bad. I told her, "Don't worry, something Shri Mataji is cleaning."

This happened in February. On March 21st, for Shri Mataji's birthday, I went to her house to ask if my mother and father could go to the UK because my sister was expecting, and they wanted the grandparents to come. When I asked Shri Mataji, she suddenly said, "Oh, your mother is not well." But my mother was well. On the 4th or 5th of April, my mother could not sleep; she was having breathing trouble. On the 12th of May, we took her to the hospital for an x-ray, and they found that her ventricle had some problem.

The same night, Shri Mataji came in the dream of my mother in the form of Shri Lakshmi and said to her, "Remember one thing: leave everything at my lotus feet. Do not worry about anything—your children, your husband. Just leave it to me. I will take care of all of them." My mother was so happy. Then she had a good sleep, and we thought that in a few days, she'll come back home.

The next night, a Tuesday night, Shri Mataji again came in the same form as Lakshmi and told my mother, "Now, do you remember what I told you? Don't you forget?" My mother said she remembered. My mother told us this story; she was so happy. That Tuesday night, she passed away.

Shri Mataji later on sent a very beautiful, private letter to my father, which I still have, in which she said, "I tried to tell you in Rahuri, but God's will is God's will. You cannot go against His will." Later on, I realized that Shri Mataji prepared her for the last journey. Shri Mataji later said, "No, no, she went up very well, no problem." That's how Shri Mataji would see it before, she prepared her.

Host: I also wanted to ask you about a similar experience you had when your father passed away. He was a fairly well-known Sahaja Yogi.

Avdut Shankar: Yes, he passed away on the 23rd of May, 1994. In February, he wrote a will, and in the will, he gave everything to Sahaja Yoga. He had written that he had a lot of cassettes, books, and everything for a Sahaja Yoga library. Then he mentioned two things: one was the Urmila flat in Andheri, and the other was land we had in Karjat. He said the land in Karjat was for his brother, and the Andheri flat should be for Sahaja Yoga. He said that these two things should not be changed.

I took this will to Shri Mataji in Cabella. As she was reading, tears were coming out of her eyes. She said in Marathi, "He has given everything and has freed himself." She said he was very astute as far as money was concerned. He was a right-hand man of Shri Babamama, who was the chartered accountant, so he took care of all his accounts and was very, very strict. She said that he could feel his death coming, that's why he wrote this will in February.

What happened was, till 1999, nothing was done about this flat. I went again to Shri Mataji, and she was not very happy with the executor of the will. She changed the executor and nominated Mr. Hari Jalan to execute the will of Pai uncle. In one or two years, this flat was in Sahaja Yoga's name.

In 2003, I had an opportunity to go in front of Shri Mataji, and she said, "Your father served me so much when he was alive, and after going, he even gave this house for Sahaja Yoga." She said it again and again. It is quite moving because when I relate it to you, I can literally see all those moments when I was in Cabella, Shri Mataji reading that letter, the tears coming out of her eyes.

Host: Very moving experience, to say the least. With this question, uncle, I think I would like to end today's session. With Mother's permission, if we can just go for a small meditation session.

Avdut Shankar: Yes, yes.

Meditation

We can all put our right hand on the Sahasrara and massage it. Put our head slightly bent in front.

A prayer to Shri Mataji: "Shri Mataji, you came upon this earth to uplift mankind. Some of us, out of all the human beings existing on this earth, are to be your instruments. Let me just be a beautiful instrument. Let me be in your company. Let me enter your kingdom of doubtless awareness. The door is called thoughtless awareness. Just let me feel the joy of Sahasrara, Nirananda."

Slightly raise your hand and feel the cool breeze coming out of your Sahasrara. Take your hand down. Let's just be in silent meditation for some time. Full humility. Gratitude for our Divine Mother.

Let's just sing the three Mahamantras.

Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Mahalakshmi Mahasaraswati Mahakali Trigunatmika Kundalini Sakshat Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namo Namaha. (x3)

Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Kalki Sakshat Shri Sahasrara Swamini Moksha Pradayini Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namo Namaha. (x3)

Tvameva Sakshat Shri Nirmala Devi Namo Namaha.

Host: Yes, Shri Mataji, uncle. It was a wonderful session and meditation. By Mother's grace, I think everybody listening would have felt the love, affection, and dedication that you have for Mother. To everyone listening, this is the second episode in the series. You will find the link for the first session in the description of this video. We'll be doing another session, the details of which will be sent across shortly. In case you have any questions, you can post them in the YouTube chat section, and we'll try and answer them in the next session. Jai Shri Mataji to everyone.

Avdut Shankar: Yes, just one thing, if I may say. First of all, thank you very much to the organizers for giving us this opportunity to be instruments. There's one word which you used. Before, we were sort of emotionally attached to Shri Mataji. Now, we have to be spiritually attached to Shri Mataji, and that is possible only through meditation. Next session, we'll see why we should meditate, how we should meditate, and what are the essential parameters we have to take into consideration. I hope it will be useful for you.

Jai Shri Mataji. Bye-bye.

Host: Jai Shri Mataji, uncle. With Mother's permission, we will end today's session here.

Avdut Shankar: Enjoy yourself. Like Shri Mataji used to say always at the airport, "Anandat raha," which means, "enjoy yourself." I always remember that. Anandat raha. Just enjoy yourself.

Host: Done, uncle. Jai Shri Mataji. Thank you so much, everyone, for coming.
