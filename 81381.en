 (England)
Thank you for joining us again today, Dr. Suresh Nigam. It's not a very sunny day here; it's a little overcast but quite pleasant. Still spring in England. Thank you for joining us from Delhi. I guess it's pretty hot there.

It's very hot, yes.

So, it’s nice to be in the cool and also to talk about cooler things. You're going to share with us today Shri Mataji's advice on our spiritual journey. I know you've shared in your previous interviews how you got your realization and your times with Shri Mataji. Today, we are going to focus on the spiritual journey and how Shri Mataji correlated the beautiful—absolutely beautiful, I mean, beautiful isn't an adequate word—scriptures and works like Amritanubhav with our Sahaj journey. Would you please start with that?

Yes. That is a book that actually confirmed for me that Shri Mataji is Adi Shakti. Through that book, what she had been saying... my problem was this: being a medical man and a very egoistic person, I wanted to know everything outright, nothing in between. So when I used to develop any doubt, I immediately started thinking, "Why should I doubt her when she's improving me? I'm getting better day by day. No problems." So that thing came in between. On one side, I doubted to begin with, and on the other side, I used to feel changes in myself. My health improved. I was improving.

So it took some time. But then, being with her, I did not know, but she was—now I can say—that she was all the time working. In fact, she was not doing anything, yet still working on everybody collectively. Whosoever came near her was benefited, though he did not know that he was being benefited. This was the state of mind. I used to really enjoy being with her, but I did not know why it so happened to begin with.

Gradually, now... you just told me about Amritanubhav. So I opened the book just about two hours back. I read it for ten minutes, and the same old days came back into my... It's an extraordinary book. If one can understand this book, nothing else is needed.

Did you ever get the chance to actually take the book in your hands and talk to Shri Mataji about it?

No, I did not take the book in my hand. But you can say now, though I was not a very good student, once I start reading these spiritual books, I would not leave them. This book, particularly, I will suggest everybody should read this, everybody. In fact, in the West, there are Sahaja Yogis who have translated Amritanubhav into English.

With the video, we'll provide the link to Amritanubhav. They are available. In fact, I told you the story that in one of the Ganpatipule programs, this book was presented to all the leaders. It is a book... I don't think anybody else... Mother has said so many times, "How could he write all these things at such a young age?" And that particular time when I was reading about duality... she said they are not two. Then she gave the example: "You have got two eyes, but you see one object. You have got two ears, but you hear one word. You have got two lips, but you utter one word. If you hit two sticks, they will make one sound." So all these things she told, and this is all in Amritanubhav.

Shri Mataji told you these examples to help understand that Shri Shiva and Shri Adi Shakti aren't separate. They are one.

They are one. Yes.

It's such a nice way to actually understand because as human beings, we have a very limited understanding and a very limited mind to understand things of this divine nature, which is beyond everything that we know of.

So many things. He has written about Moksha. Everybody in Sahaja Yoga, I remember after about ten years of coming into Sahaja Yoga, all these persons—Greg, Guido, David Sparrow, and all these persons—they would always ask Shri Mataji, "When would we get Moksha?" She used to smile and say, "You have already got it. You have got it." We could not understand.

But today, I was going through this Amritanubhav, and in that it is written: till you have got the real knowledge, the true knowledge, Moksha is a very big thing. But the moment you get the pure knowledge of Atman, it has no value. Moksha has no value. Because you have become, in this living life, you have got your Moksha. The moment you have got the pure knowledge, you have no desire of getting Moksha. You know it. You don't think about it. This is what Shri Mataji used to tell us.

Tell us some more memories with Shri Mataji on your spiritual journey about how you strengthened your vibratory knowledge, the Sahaj knowledge. How was that pure knowledge imbibed in your subtle being? Being in the presence of Shri Mataji, of course, must have been a vast help.

It was automatically being done, I believe so. Because once, there was a lady, and Mother, me, and that lady, we were only three persons. Mother asked, "What is it?" I said, "Shri Mataji, it's Swadhisthana." I was feeling so much pain in my left Swadhisthana. I said, "Shri Mataji, it is Left Swadhisthana."

"No, no, it's not Left Swadhisthana."

I said, "Why?" It was paining so much, my Left Swadhisthana. I said again, "Shri Mataji, Left Swadhisthana." And then she said, "Yes, yes, Left Swadhisthana." These are the ways one learns. Many a time, she judges you, how you react. That is very important. I was lucky that way; she never told me anything specific. But yes, I did get many informations.

Are there any particular ones you'd like to share with us?

I told you that example when she was sick. She came back from England and was staying in Qutab Ashram. She had a very high fever, all of a sudden. So she tried to work on herself. Then she said, "Bring a photograph." A photograph was in her room, and we gave that photograph to her. She said, "This photograph does not have vibrations." We kept quiet. We were three persons, including myself, with Shri Mataji in her apartment in Qutab Ashram.

And then I was lost. I just started praying to her. After some time, she felt better. But these are the things which we never discussed. The point was this thing was for us. She was teaching us. Every act of hers was to tell us, teach us, "Do this thing this way, that thing that way." This is what she used to do.

She always said one thing: "Meditate, meditate." Two things she always said: forgiveness and detachment. Do you know, I read a book in which some boy asked his guru, "What is forgiveness?" The answer was, "Forgiveness is that sweet fragrance of a flower, which, when it is being crushed, emits the fragrance." The flower is being crushed, and still it is giving fragrance for others. This is forgiveness, that you are killing the flower, and it is still forgiving you and giving you fragrance.

Just before we proceed, remind us please, when was this incident where Shri Mataji tested you? The photograph she said didn't have vibrations, and then you and the other two Sahaja Yogis prayed to Shri Mataji quietly, and then the vibrations came.

I don't remember the year. It must be around '94.

Okay. Please continue. Is there another experience you would like to share with us?

So many. I don't remember which I have told you and which I have not.

In the beginning, I am being very honest with you on this point, we used to feel vibrations on both hands and be very happy. Someday it used to come on one hand and not on the other hand. Then we were not very happy. But the moment they came on both hands, we were very happy. Later on, we started feeling Agnya and Vishuddhi and Nabhi and all these things, gradually. Because in Maharashtra, when you traveled to Maharashtra, they were all very, very well-advanced Sahaja Yogis. The moment they saw anybody, they knew, "This is caught, that is caught." That thing came later on.

One day, somebody came and Shri Mataji said to me, without spreading her hand, she told me, "I could feel on my body." That was the first day I saw her just telling. Before that, she used to normally open her hand.

So when you met this yogi from Maharashtra who had such an advanced knowledge about vibratory awareness, one is assuming you were inspired to...

I'm sorry to say this, I don't think they were very great Sahaja Yogis. No. It was all Agnya.

Okay. Tell us some more experiences with Shri Mataji.

Did I tell you what type of food we used to get in Ganpatipule?

No, please tell us about it.

In Ganpatipule, which started in 1985, we from Delhi used to go in quite a large number. The payment used to be 1200-1300 rupees. At that time, it was big money. And we egoistic people from Delhi used to think that we paid so much and they are giving this food. Really unbelievable. We could not eat that food. So there was a feeling that this is very bad, the food is very bad. It went on like this for two years, '85-'86.

In '87, really, I'm telling you, that food... that was a great thing that she made us eat that food. That was also a tapa. You have to eat this type of food. You have to sleep on the floor. All these things she taught us in Ganpatipule. So everybody was very happy because the atmosphere was very good, but as far as food was concerned, people were not very happy.

So what happened one day, a lady from Maharashtra—she was a smart type of a lady—prepared a thali for Shri Mataji for the bhog. She put a cloth over it, covered it, and she took that thali towards Shri Mataji's room. I was standing just outside the room. This lady was holding the thali and Mother asked, "What is it? What is it?"

"Shri Mataji, it's a complete thali."

"Show me." As soon as Mother saw it, she said, "You're feeding these people this food?" Then she scolded her a lot. Then she said to us, "This food is not very good here. It's better if you order from Delhi."

So we had a man who used to work as a caterer. His name was Nikku. We used to take him from Delhi in a truck full of stuff, and we used to eat there. Then things became much better. The main purpose of all these things is that she taught you how to live in every condition. She taught you how to eat it, stay with it, don't get tired, and still enjoy it. This was the thing. And we really enjoyed Ganpatipule the most.

It's a fantastic place. What a festive atmosphere it used to be. When Shri Mataji used to come to Ratnagiri Station, the whole bogey... oh wow. We used to greet her with fireworks as her car would go to MTDC.

I traveled with her from Mumbai to Ratnagiri by helicopter. Wow. In the beginning, she came one or two years by car, and it was tiring. Rajesh Shah organized a helicopter. For 16 years, only leaders were allowed to travel with Shri Mataji. So twice, we traveled with Shri Mataji. I think it was '94 or '95. I have got the photograph; I will send it to you.

It's just imprinted on the memory. Such lovely times.

Actually, she taught us everything personally. I remember, I always tell everybody now that she taught us how to sit, how to walk, how to eat, how much to eat, what not to eat, what type of clothes you should wear, how to keep yourself clean, all these things. Brush your teeth twice a day. Throw out the brush after six months. All these things she said. Everything she told, actually. If you see all her videos, she has explained about everything.

Any miracles that come to your attention that you would like to share?

Oh, miracles. There are so many. Have you heard the name of Mr. Bajaj? Rahul Bajaj. He had a heart problem. So these VIP people, he showed himself in the best hospital in Bombay. They referred him to the USA. He went to the USA and they suggested open heart surgery. He said, "Alright, after 15 days, I'll do it."

So Rahul Bajaj came back to India and then he met Shri Mataji, I think it was through Rajesh Shah. Shri Mataji worked on him and told him, "Now you are alright." Mr. Bajaj could not believe this thing. He went to his Bombay doctor, who said, "Yes, there is no need of any operation." But still, he could not believe it. Then he went to America, and there again they said, "You don't need a bypass surgery. Your aorta has been opened up. There is no need for the operation." I have got the video of his; if you want, I can send it to you.

Yes, please share it. That would be awesome.

It reminds me of this story. At India Today in Connaught Place in Delhi in those days, I had a boss, a director, the late Mr. N.P. Singh. He used to see the little photo of Shri Mataji on my desk. So he asked, "Oh, how do you know her?" I said, "Yes, she is my guru." And then he shared a story that Shri Mataji was at a dinner party, and he was one of the guests. He was sitting somewhere close to Shri Mataji, but he was in excruciating pain in his back. Nobody else knew, and because it was a formal party, he was carrying on as usual.

But Shri Mataji, out of her compassion, she asked, "You are in pain. I can treat you." And he was like, "Wow, you can?" So Shri Mataji took him into the other room and put her foot on his back, and his pain went. It disappeared. He couldn't believe it. But the Maya is such... he was very appreciative and thankful about it. He told me the story, but he wasn't a Sahaja Yogi. He was a very nice person. But you see the Maya of the Adi Shakti, that you're so close, you benefit from being close to her physically, and yet, you get lost in the Maya, isn't it?

There are so many cases. Even our ex-president... I remember very well, whenever Shri Mataji would come to Delhi, Mr. Advani was a regular visitor to her. He used to talk to Shri Mataji for hours. Advani Ji was one of the guests at Shri Mataji's 75th birthday felicitations, wasn't he? And I remember in Chhindwara, we celebrated her birthday. Two or three leaders came. There were ministers; they came to attend that program. A person like Balasaheb Thackeray, who never cared for anybody, he came to attend Advani Ji's daughter's wedding and he was sitting with Shri Mataji for about an hour or more than that, during the marriage ceremonies. So, she had something different. And that we know, at least. We are lucky for that.

Very fortunate, you're right. Very fortunate. Really thankful to Shri Mataji. A person like me, who really didn't want to live, she made me live and gave me that honor which I never deserved. Now, I can talk to people, I can interact with them. This is a great blessing because of her only.

Absolutely. Tell us something about the house in Lucknow. I know in one of the previous interviews, you shared with us how reluctant Shri Mataji was to visit Lucknow because of how the people of Uttar Pradesh had treated Sita Ji so many thousands of years ago. And then Shri Mataji built that house in Nirala Nagar. Can you share some memories from that time?

Actually, that was the time when Sir C.P. was in his job. I am from Kanpur, and I was very eager to see Shri Mataji come to Lucknow or Kanpur. She immediately said nothing to me. But later on, she agreed. Last time, you were asking the name of that village. Sendua is the name of that village where the whole village is Sahaja Yogi. There is no hall. They all sit under a very big tree. They bring their own charpais on Sunday, and it's a gathering of the whole village. Sendua is the place near Sitapur. I had been there.

It would be nice to visit there at some point.

Whenever you go to Lucknow, we will tell you. Sahaja Yoga is spreading very fast, even now. But some people have their own interests and selfishness. But it's spreading like anything.

Would you remember anything about Shri Mataji saying to you about her house in Lucknow?

Yes, I told you the whole story of how she built it. She used to travel on a rickshaw and a tonga to bring things because she never wanted to take the car of Sir C.P. because he was in a government job. She didn't want to use that. She herself told this thing in a lecture. She has talked about it at the Shri Kartikeya Puja in Germany.

And we'll put the link with this video so everyone can watch how Shri Mataji described how she got that house in Nirala Nagar constructed. Is there anything else that you would remember from those times?

Lucknow house, I don't remember because I just saw it once. That too when Shri Mataji sent me to open a center in Lucknow. Regarding that, I went to Lucknow to find out a place. At that time, I think somebody took me and showed me Shri Mataji's house from the outside. This was in '82 or '83.

Okay, is there any other memory you would like to share with us before we conclude?

Next time, I will note them down.

Okay. Thank you so much, Dr. Suresh Nigam, for joining us. It's beautiful to talk to you and to relive the memories.

I will still suggest you go through this book, Amritanubhav. Tell everybody to go through it. It is available, and I think it should be available in the market.

Also, some Sahaja Yogis have written it, and it's available on the net. So, we'll provide the link with the video so they can also enjoy and benefit from it. Okay. Thank you so much for joining us today. Jai Shri Mataji. And Shri Mataji, thank you so much for everything.

Jai Shri Mataji. Jai Shri Mataji.
