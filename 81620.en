Hello, everybody. It's very nice to be with you all again and to share memorable moments with Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji recognized me because of my accent. And yes, I have a French accent because I'm French. I'm aware that some yogis are sometimes annoyed by this accent. Once, one of them was present when I was speaking to Shri Mataji. Shri Mataji looked at him and said, "Oh, her English is quite good." But at other times, she was just laughing, laughing a lot, repeating the words I was twisting. She was just having fun with my French English. So you too, don't be annoyed and just have fun.

In one ashram, some flowers once came for Shri Mataji from a yogi living abroad. One yogi said, "We cannot give these flowers to Shri Mataji because this guy is very, very strange and funny." Another yogi said, "No, we can't do that. We have to inform Shri Mataji, and she will decide." In fact, Shri Mataji accepted the flowers and said, "Even the foolish ones have the right to worship God."

If we are in Sahaja Yoga, it is because each one of us was found worthy by Shri Mataji to be a cell of her cosmic body. This is our role in this big divine play of transformation, of evolution. In our big Sahaj family, there is only one to be put on a pedestal and only one to be worshipped, and this is our Divine Mother. She confirmed this in Poland after I told her, "Shri Mataji, people are comparing us with the disciples of Christ."

Shri Mataji said, "You see, when people see me, they know, they feel that I'm someone special, that I'm someone higher. And they put me on a pedestal. But when these people see you, human beings like they are, this gives them the confidence to also be able to achieve what they see in us. You are my advertisement."

Shri Mataji came to Mulhouse in '83 to give a program and meet the yogis. One German yogi, Thomas, showed Shri Mataji on a map that not far away from our place, in the Vosges mountains, there is a huge military cemetery. During the First World War, about 30,000 German and French soldiers were killed there, and more than twice that were injured. Shri Mataji asked for a coconut. She took the coconut and spoke some mantras into it, and then she asked us to put this coconut under the earth in the cemetery, which we did the same day.

This was in '83. In 2014, I read that the German president, Mr. Gauck, and the French president, Mr. Hollande, laid the first stone in this place for a French-German museum as a symbol of reconciliation.

When our little group from Mulhouse offered Shri Mataji a present before she left—it was a silk scarf painted by one of us—she said, "But you already offered me the best present yesterday with all these people who got their realization."

I must say that the first times after my realization, I was just lifted up. Everything was going very well. I was happy, life was beautiful, wonderful. I developed a kind of arrogance because when I saw brothers and sisters having problems, I couldn't understand. I thought, "They have their Kundalini awakened. Then why do they have problems?" This continued until I myself was put in a problematic situation. Then I could look at myself and say, "No, Christine, you have the Kundalini awakened. Then why do you have these problems?" I knew at this point that the real Sahaj work of purification and transformation was starting.

During one meditation, I saw a bird flying in the sky, very straight. Suddenly, this bird fell down. After some time, the bird was flying to the sky again, but very smoothly, very gently, not straight away. And I knew it was me.

When Shri Mataji came to Strasbourg in '85, she spoke about my problematic situation, which was over by this time. She said, "You see, I could have told something to Christine, but I wanted her to see by herself."

What I remember about Strasbourg is that my sister and I prepared a garland of flowers to welcome Shri Mataji. The flowers, the colors, were an exact match with the sari that she wore at that time. I also remember we were maybe two or three ladies in the bedroom with Shri Mataji, and I felt she was preparing me for marriage. She was telling us how miserable the life of a man who is alone is. How miserable. "When you see his house, there is one broken chair in a corner, broken cups on the table. And if this man is lucky, he has a dog to whom he can give his love." She was also mentioning how her husband, Sir C.P., spends ten times more at the market than she does when she is buying.

But there were also some yogis criticizing me because I dared to be in the flat where Shri Mataji was staying after my problematic situation, which was already over. Before leaving Strasbourg, Shri Mataji gave some presents to some yogis. She called me, and she had a necklace of pearls for me. She wanted to put this necklace around my neck, but she couldn't open it. With great humor, she said, "You see, I can manage the whole world, but I'm not able to open a necklace." Someone helped her, and she put it around my neck.

I was not the only one to be moved. Even one of the criticizers came to see me afterwards and said, "Christine, you see, when I felt the love of Shri Mataji, I just couldn't stop crying." And Warren, who was sitting there, was telling him, "Stop crying. You are a man."

With such a gesture, Shri Mataji showed us, "I know everything about you. I know what you had to go through." And she, the only one with the authority to judge our ill-doings, didn't criticize, didn't judge. But with great, great patience, she helped us to recognize what is wrong in us so that we could correct it and improve on our spiritual path. She never, ever put someone down. No. She elevated everybody. And this is the magic of divine motherly love, compassion, Saandra Karuna, protection, guidance, intelligence, diplomacy.

Another story to be shared with you. It was in India, after a Birthday Puja or Shiva Puja, I don't remember. It was in a big stadium. Everything after the puja was fine, but suddenly I saw some people and I reacted completely against them inside me. It was so frustrating because I could see, clearly, that even after a puja, these people had the power to put me out of my balance. I was not strong enough to go beyond. Inside myself, I just said, "Shri Mataji, what should I do?" The answer came immediately. I jumped, because what I heard was such a strong thunder, as if the whole sky was shouting a big, loud voice, telling one word: "Forgive."

And a story from Vienna, which shows how to avoid doing something without hurting somebody. A Sahaja Yogini came into the hotel with blueberries to make a dessert for Shri Mataji. We tasted the blueberries and they were too sour. We told her, "Shri Mataji doesn't like sour foods. We cannot offer them to her." Very self-confidently, she said, "No, no, no. You will see, with sugar it will be very good. Excellent." We couldn't do anything to change her mind. We gave up.

After shopping, Shri Mataji came into the hotel. But this time, she didn't go immediately to the salon. She came through the kitchen. She went to the kitchen and saw the blueberries. She said, "Oh, blueberries. Must be very sour." And this Sahaja Yogini said, "No, no, Shri Mataji. With sugar, it will be excellent." Shri Mataji said, "Alright. You prepare these blueberries, but I will give you the recipe. You take a red paprika. You cut it into small cubes. You mix it with the blueberries. You put some salt. And you eat this dessert." So this lady did it. Shri Mataji vibrated the dessert, and then she said to the lady, "And now you distribute this dessert to everybody who is here, because this dessert is very good for the liver of everybody." So Shri Mataji didn't eat one of them. And we just enjoyed our prasad, good for our liver.

About our center in the center of Vienna, on Postgasse. It was during a seminar. One brother that a lot of you know, Steve Jones, expressed the desire to have a drop-in center in Vienna. We had four or five people meeting for this project. What was beautiful in this group was that nobody wanted to dominate the others; we just listened to each other. We all agreed, if it has to be, it will come. We don't push anything. We also agreed for the center to be used only for meditation and giving realization, to maintain the level of vibrations.

We found one place. The evening of the day we found it, during the meditation, our son, who was ten years old at the time, chose a cassette by chance. In this cassette, Shri Mataji was telling how she found Ganapatipule. She also said, "When the desire is pure, all the deities, all the angels, all the Ganas will help you. Paramchaitanya too. And your dreams become true."

When my husband, Herman, was in the financial committee, which took place in our house, he informed the people that we had found a place for a center. He didn't have to speak a lot because, without him asking, the vibrations suddenly flew so strongly. I was not part of this financial committee; I was in the kitchen. But at the same time, I also felt this strong flow of vibrations, just like the others. Even one of the yogis said, "But it's like a puja." So we didn't have to argue. We didn't have to explain anything. It just worked out.

The center, since 2006, has been open without interruption, except during the time of the pandemic when, because of the government, we had to close it. Otherwise, from Monday till Friday, we have an evening program—music programs, programs in German, in English, in Russian, in Ukrainian. We have meditation at 6 o'clock in the morning. We have workshops during the weekend. I think there are about 50 or 60 people involved in the center.

To see how each one of us, with our proper qualities and abilities, is helping in this center, it reminds me of the words Shri Mataji said in '85 in Strasbourg: "There will be a state without government where everybody will know what he has to do and will be respected for what he is doing."

In Vienna in 2009... yes, it was very painful to see her in the state she was at this time. In a wheelchair. No more speaking to yogis, no more interfering with yogis. As if indifferent to all that was happening around her. We knew that she would not be able to come to the center on Postgasse. So we prepared an album with pictures of the center to show her and to express our thankfulness, our gratitude. We were able to go and present this album to Shri Mataji, giving information about the center. And in the moment where he said, "And Shri Mataji, the center is mostly run by ladies," in that moment, Shri Mataji looked at me. She smiled at me. She nodded her head. She gave her blessing to the center.

You see, we cannot reduce this big incarnation to the human form she had. She is Mahamaya. She is beyond our understanding. She is beyond our concepts. And when she left her body in 2011, she didn't leave us, her children. She didn't abandon us. She is still alive in us and outside of us. And her divine magic is going on.

In this world full of aggressiveness, of hatred, each one of us is so precious to be an instrument for her love—this love fighting the negativity that wants to destroy her creation. It's not a question of how long we are in Sahaja Yoga, but how strong our connection and faith in the divine is. How intense is our desire to transform ourselves into nobler personalities.

We saw in her lifetime how hard she worked for the emancipation of mankind, how much suffering she took upon herself. As she said, "Christ was crucified once. I am crucified every day."

So we, her children, if in our daily life, we desire with determination, with sincerity, with humility, not to cease from mental fight—like William Blake said in his wonderful poem, "Jerusalem"—if we decide, wherever we are, whatever we are doing, to train our attention to be at her lotus feet; if we desire to develop in us more and more the divine weapons, like thoughtless awareness, introspection, forgiving, witnessing, surrendering; then we do justice to the trust she placed in us. So that, as a proud mother, she can say about us, "These are my children. I love them. I chose them. And they do not deceive me."
