 (England)
I cannot tell him myself. So, in a sense, it means that she cared about England, that she loved the English, and that's why she was so much older. Well, it's a bit like the older children have to take responsibility. But also, they didn't mind taking it. They didn't mind actually hearing it. They didn't mind because they probably didn't notice.

Oh, well, I don't know... No, no, no. Pat and Maureen, okay, they had the core training. They had to notice.

But I noticed at Cabella, we worked there for months, seven days a week, and got blasted one day into the next. Then one person does a little dance in front of Shri Mataji at the theater and gets praised. And there were times when you... well, that's what they could take. But it was tough. Tough.

One day, we were coming back from Ratnagiri by boat. Shri Mataji was whisked away in a car with Rajesh—he was, of course, very jealous—and I ended up in another car with Paul Winter and Bala Kanayasam. These are two remarkable characters. Paul and Bala started fighting. Paul had rented the car, and he wanted to offload Bala in the middle of nowhere. We were on the road to boarding, and I was saying, "No, Paul, you cannot do this. This guy's going to get lost." I was trying to make peace between two strong personalities.

We arrived, the three of us, before Shri Mataji, completely caught up. And Shri Mataji started in on me. And that's when She just completely... so I walked away. Then Rajesh asked Shri Mataji, "Mother, why did you scold Gregoire when it was the two others who were fighting?"

And Shri Mataji told him, "Because Gregoire was the only one who could take it."

Yes, that happened. A dubious privilege. It happens a lot. But the next morning, She gave me a little statue of Shri Kartikeya, which I don't know what it means, but... I still have it on my altar.

It's true. It happened many times to many people, I think. There's a difference between the training and the knowledge.
