 (England)
It was green. All the seeds were green and a bit plush and plump. And we used to... Were you with Mother here? Yeah, we used to come sometimes when we were catching the train. We used to sometimes go back and forth with Mother. We'd have cucumber sandwiches and tea. Cucumber sandwiches and... Well, I don't think we came back often. It's just so strong in my mind, even if it was once.

Yeah, yeah. I don't remember being with Shri Mataji. I remember being with Her in McDonald's, just on the other side, because I had some sort of moment where I was saying, "Wow, God is drinking Coca-Cola." I had the same thing. The same sort of vision as you at Ashley Gardens. That Mother was moving in to Ashley Gardens, and She sent the lad out for a McDonald's. Yeah, yeah, that's right. We all had that.

And Mother was so unconventional because, you know how She thinks about alcohol, right? I remember there was this worker, an English worker who worked with her, and She gave him a bottle of Black Chivas Regal, which is a rather good brand of whiskey. She gave it to him because that's what was going to make him happy at that point.

When She left Oxted Green, there were a load of guys doing removal stuff for her. And when they left with the stuff they were taking away, on the table, there were about eight or ten bottles of either Chivas Regal or some other Scotch whiskey for them to have one each. She gave them one each. And when the boss found out, he was horrified. He could already hear singing coming from the back of the truck. Yeah, because that was supposed to be gifts for diplomats, no? And Mother... Yeah, yeah. Or when She gave the cigars to the lady, also. She called us all to come and help. She was inviting all the ladies from the surrounding houses. We were coming to be the English people. And one of them asked if she could smoke. So Mother offered her a really good Habana cigar. And you could see this woman was torn between wanting to look cool and accept it, but knowing that there's no way she could smoke a cigar. So Mother just called her bluff completely. And she sort of said, "No, thank you, that's fine."

Well, Gus told me that, because he was present at one of their diplomatic get-togethers at the house, he said neither Sir C.P. nor Mother seemed to have any concept of what alcohol did to people, because they just kept filling people's glasses as fast as they could. They seemed to have no idea, especially Sir C.P.

Well, you know, it happened in diplomatic circles. I saw it in China, because in China, they have a very strong alcohol, and they make you drink. Because at some point you can't handle it, and then you are more vulnerable. No, I mean, I remember that's one time where I was full of sympathy for Pat. That was one of the tests in your life. Because I think at some point, Shri Mataji told you to pour the bottles of... I still remember that, because I thought, "Gee, this is going to be tough for us." He was brave. But he was brave from the moment when Mother told the people in Gavin's home, "You should drop drugs." The feeling in the group was, "No way." And then Pat said, "Okay, I'll do it." And I remember that. I remember that.

That was the only time I saw you, I think, until we went to India. To Kathmandu, yeah. Well, we met in Mumbai first, and then we went off. That was the only time, because you stayed with Mother, and we didn't see you. This is when I had this ridiculous white suit, or not? I don't remember that. I just remember you sort of on your knees in front of Mother saying, "Forgive them, they know not what they do," or something. No, it was true. I know, it was very dramatic. I saw it. None of the others were.

Yeah, but I remember when he said, "I will stop," it was like time stopped. Because the group was really not... they were not taking the message.

I was telling friends about this white suit because Shri Mataji told me, "We're going to see the yogis." I came from the U.S. I had an American army jacket and jeans, and that's the way I knocked at the door, and the American army jacket was torn. So I said, "Oh my God, we're going to meet the yogis." So I went and I bought a sort of Elvis Presley white suit, and on top of it—I must have been out of my mind—a red bow. And I arrived. We climbed the stairs, and I looked in the room, so I took my bow out. I couldn't take the suit off, obviously. But they made fun of me for this for quite some time. The yogis... "We're going to meet the yogis, my God, the yogis." They were a very wild bunch. There was only one or two there that were... even those were very new. But the whole room was full of the whole local crowd. I saw them all, and I thought, "Oh my God, I don't know what's going to happen here," because they were quite a bunch.

It was only about the second or third time. It was my second or third time. Was that during the trip you came over from America in the first place? To meet Mother? No, because you met her earlier. Was that a second trip to see her, or was it the first trip?

No, that's not the first trip. It must be the second one. I think it's around the 20th of August 1975.

Yeah. It was the 15th of September when we first came.

Oh, so it must have been the second. Oh, you came after me? Yes. Oh, I didn't know that. I thought you came before. So that meeting is after that. Yeah, so that was my third.

I got lost, you remember? I stopped then, and then I missed... I was trying to help this wretched Ignatius to come to Mother's house, and he didn't turn up, and I failed to make it. I got lost. So I went off the wagon spectacularly that weekend. I remember going round there and you were singing, "What a difference a day makes." That was it for you, but I was in such a state. I know. But the thing was, it meant so much to you to miss it.

What is sweet is we pretty soon had a feeling of brothers and sisters. I remember my feeling towards Marie Rouget a bit later. Sir C.P. had just arrived, and I was always anxious that we behave correctly. I remember Marie was sort of crying on the shoulder of Shri Mataji, and I was feeling so embarrassed, but I was feeling embarrassed as if it was my own sister who doesn't know. My embarrassment was, "My own sister doesn't know, it's not time to do this before the husband of Shri Mataji." So we gelled together pretty fast, I feel. We were such an odd mixture. I just couldn't believe it. I know. It was the hope of the world, this kind of strange people.

In Oxted Green, I remember Shri Mataji putting all Her shoes on the table. Or many shoes on the table. You don't remember? You must have been there. Shri Mataji put I don't know how many pairs of shoes on the table, and we were around with our hands because we asked her to put our hands towards Her shoes. Do you remember? And we were looking so stoned. And I was looking at the scene and I said, "Right, now we have to change the world with this bunch." A dozen pairs of shoes and taking vibrations... we didn't actually know what it was to take vibrations from.

Well, Pat was saying that She had tried speaking to a politician. Well, lots of them. She tried in her own circles and got nowhere. It was William Whitelaw, wasn't it? She was speaking to him at a dinner party and was talking to him about how we must change society. And he literally turned around and said, "Well, why? What's wrong with it?" Well, now we would have the answer. But even so, you see, if you're rich and okay, in his view, his life was fine. It was other people's problem. So, that's when Mother said She had to start looking at other people, because She tried with the people that didn't have the huge deficit that we had.

So, at some point, we were in Dehradun, and we gave realization to a gentleman who was, at that time, we called Joshi, and he was the chief of staff of the Indian Army. Look at the top, solid. We were there and at some point, he didn't really feel the vibration. And then I asked him to ask Shri Mataji, "Are you Shri Durga?" because Durga is the goddess of the warriors, right? And he asked the picture. Tears started coming out of his eyes. And then I said, "Gee, what is the difference?" This is the General-in-Chief of the army. And here, you would be a... but it's not only England, okay? It's the West. All the guys who are somewhere up the ladder in our country just have too much ego. So, we were very happy to have a few doctors when they showed up.

Bob Dan had given up being a doctor. He was working in a factory. He'd lost confidence in being a doctor. I remember him telling you, "Actually, no, I'm not doing that anymore." He'd spent too long in Goa on the beach. But to him, he could see it was a complete waste of time. He wrote his book for all the stoneheads of the world.

Yeah, well, I'll have to try and find a few now. Did you notice I spelled the first word in the book wrong? Foreword. Yeah, it was spelled "forward," as in forward march. He cringes every time you remember. It should be "foreword," the word before. Yeah, yeah. But I spelled it "forward," as in going forward. And the proofreader missed it. Everyone missed it. So, there's no way I could promote it with that, because it would just be ridiculed by anyone who wasn't involved.

But, you know, when I read, because your parents were administrators in Hong Kong, and this was a generation of doers. They were a solid generation. It's like the father of Brian was a Wing Commander in the Royal Air Force. I read a book when I was in the U.S. that inspired Newt Gingrich and Al Gore, Generations. And what they say, and I think it applies to you, is that because the generation of our parents were such solid people—that generation who defeated Hitler, who built the Bretton Woods institutions, engineers, no-nonsense, solid people—because of them, we had the guts to seek. And today, people who throw stones in Brixton or wherever, they don't seek, because the parents didn't give them any start.

Yeah. You know, we took our mum to Cabella two weeks ago. Your mum? She's 92. And she's so quiet. And do you know what she said? "This place is another world." She's been a Catholic all her life, but she said, "It's amazing. It's so peaceful." So she's got her blessings.

Is your dad still alive? No, he passed away. He had a hard time because of his drinking, you know. But he recognized Mother. He did, but you know what happened.
