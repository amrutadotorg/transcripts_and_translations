 (England)
Thank you, Maureen. Pat, Jamel from France. Maureen and Pat from the north of England, thank you. Thank you all for joining us for another session of Golden Memories, and Jamel, for bringing us all together.

Maureen and Pat, just to take from where we left off in part one of the interview, Maureen and Jamel were talking about the golden memories with Shri Mataji in 1977 when you, Jamel, got your self-realization. You were a student studying aeronautics then, and now you are a retired aeronautical engineer. Maureen is running her own accountancy firm, and Patrick... so thank you all for joining us this evening. And Jamel is still working, doesn't have the leisure to retire just yet. Thank you so much for joining us this evening to share your golden memories with Shri Mataji in those days when there were very, very few of you around.

So, would you like to start, Maureen, from where we left off? I'll share some photos and we can talk through the different times and the different moments you had, just to give an atmosphere of how those times were. Because this is the late 70s we are talking about, when there was no internet, there was no TV like we have now, 24/7. There was media you can access, social media somewhere or the other, or television. It was a time when there was a quality of life. Life was slow and more relaxed, let's say.

And no mobile phones either. There was just a landline. That's right, yes. And no Sahaja Yoga speakers with Shri Mataji in the West. This is a photo of Shri Mataji in Oxford, at a beautiful home. Would you like to talk us through this, please, in those early days?

Well, Pat and I obviously, we came together on the same day, which was the 15th of September 1975, and we got the opportunity after meeting Shri Mataji at a person's house in London to actually go to her house in Oxford, where this picture was taken. Pat didn't get to come the first time, but the second time he was there. Shri Mataji invited the seekers, who were a completely mixed bunch—mainly hippies, although there were some people like Gavin and Jane who worked and had their businesses. But we had given up all work and anything in order to seek.

So when we met Shri Mataji and she invited us to her house, we went along, and it was for a weekend, so you actually stayed there. This was from her front room, and she had many beautiful statues of deities from India. You can't see them all there, but there's one small one there on one side. Shri Mataji gave talks, she gave us food, and she basically... I mean, that room there was quite a big room. You remember, Pat? It was absolutely full of us. There were lots of us, weren't there?

We had afternoon sleeps. There was one picture of people all sleeping on the floor in there. An afternoon nap, if I remember rightly. We used to do that. It was so homely and comforting to be in Mother's presence. What a privilege. We had no idea of protocol, no idea of anything really, except what we felt from Mother, which was this incredible vision of her as a deity. And whatever she said to us at the time, just everything, was just pearls of wisdom.

Everything she said, what I can remember that first time I met her, was feeling that she had basically, at that second, decided which finger related to which chakra, and if she felt like it, she could swap it around. It was all her knowledge. There was never a moment that you felt that this was anything other than coming entirely from the source. Amazing. And she looked after us literally like a mother, in terms of absolutely everything.

It was completely otherworldly. It was completely... I mean, that was where I had that vision of Shri Mataji as Mother Mary when she was working on me. And somehow, it didn't seem unusual. Everything seemed entirely normal. It was the outside world that seemed unreal.

Here’s a photo of all of you who are on the panel today, just to give a sense of where you were and how you were. In the present, we are in a different phase of life, but those were times when you were just students, studying, trying to figure out the purpose and meaning of life.

Pat is there behind the lady stood up with the red sari on, who's called Marie. Unfortunately, you can't see his face. Jamel is beside Pat there, and I'm knelt down behind the little boy, who's my nephew, Pat's son, Kevin. I'm on Shri Mataji's right, so the left of the photograph. That sari that I'm wearing was one that Shri Mataji gave me, and the same with Marie and with Christine, the other lady sat the other side of Kevin.

As you can see, Shri Mataji is wearing a garland of sandalwood, because we didn't know about garlands or how to do them or how to make them. If you can imagine, it was completely outside our sphere. We were learning literally everything, and Shri Mataji had to guide us. Satpal, the gentleman stood up on Shri Mataji's right, on the far right, he was a pujari who helped us go through pujas and things.

When the time came for the arti, we used to get a record out, a movie about this Indian lady who went to America and got caught up in everything. She realized her roots came from India and came out of it. On the cover of the record was this Indian girl in a miniskirt holding a glass of champagne and a cigarette, and we used to play the original version of the arti. It was the Shri Ganesha arti, wasn't it? The original version.

Mr. Satpal did everything because we didn't know anything. He didn't just conduct the puja; he used to give us a little talk beforehand, like a sort of little Shri Mataji. I remember once he was giving one of his talks, and I was really bored. I looked at Shri Mataji and she gave me this smile as if she was quite bored too, waiting for him to finish. But he was a very sweet guy.

Here you can see Pat, even though he's looking down.

I was upset. I was upset with Kevin. That's why I didn't want to be photographed.

This is Jane on the left, on Shri Mataji's right, stood up.

Sadly, I think Satpal most probably is no more. Gavin, of course, is gone a few months ago, and Douglas left last year. In fact, of all these people, I think the last men standing are you, Pat, and me.

Jamel, we could ask, what did you make of it? Was this your first puja with Shri Mataji?

It must have been the second puja, because the first one was the Guru Puja on the first of July, outside India. Remember when Mother said we should put the tape recorder on to get her talk? I said, "Why? We're all here." And I remember giving those flowers to Mother, and I said, "Be careful, because there are thorns in them." She said, "I have to take the thorns as well as the flowers."

This is a bit like... it looks like yesterday, because I remember this so clearly. This was in North Gower Street in London, near Euston. It's where we went for our second meeting with Mother after we met her in the flats the time before. All subsequent meetings were at Gavin and Jane's, and Shri Mataji used to sleep on that sofa. It became a sofa bed. We'd all take vibrations. It was amazing. It was thanks to Gavin, actually, that we were having all those programs.

Is there any particular anecdote you remember from that occasion?

Yes. I remember we had a puja, and I even remember something because I was having difficulties stopping smoking. I remember in the morning, when we slept in Shri Mataji's house, Douglas woke up and said, "It's amazing. I feel like I have a smoker's throat." I didn't say anything, but I knew it was from me. There's such collective consciousness that you could feel anything that's happening around you. There was such a sensitivity. We were such a small group, and Shri Mataji's attention—this is something that we don't realize now, but when you look back—Shri Mataji's attention was on a very small group of people. She was aware. If you did a puja, the next day she would talk to you. She’d say, "Oh, I had my attention on you," and you'd say, "Sorry, I was doing a small puja, I was working and worshipping you," or something like that. Beautiful.

I remember that was when Kevin was there with Shri Mataji. It was that time Mother was working on him and asked him to put his finger on his Agnya. Then she was asking him, "What can you see? Can you see anything?" And he said, "I can see a man and a donkey." I thought he was messing around and I got annoyed with him. Then Mother said, "Yes, and is anyone sitting on the donkey?" And he said, "Yes, there's a lady sitting on the donkey." Then she said, "Can you recognize who that lady is?" And he said, "A great big dragon has come and eaten up the picture." And Mother said, "That's a Catholic conditioning stopping him from recognizing me."

And you thought he was mocking you when he said, "I can see a man and a donkey."

I thought, oh no, he's messing around. But this was like 18 months or two years after our first visits to Mother's house, so it had sort of jumped forward quite a lot. We'd learned quite a lot by then. By then, we'd already been to India, and we learned a lot there. That really shook us up because we had no idea about protocol at all, except this natural reverence we felt for and love for Shri Mataji. We had no idea of rules and regulations or what you should and shouldn't do.

How was it for you, Jamel? Because you came from a different background. Do you remember that time?

I remember you showed me around Mother's house. I show you all the deities. I had no idea. You took me around, and I knew you liked that Shiva statue, the white one on the mantelpiece. Then you took me upstairs and showed me the Ganesha statue, and the vibrations. So I put my hands towards it, diffidently, of course, and I felt lots of cool air. That's the start of it. I was very lucky, actually; I had Pat with me because he taught me a lot of things. He sort of pushed me out of my stupid conditionings. I wasn't aware of them. That might resonate with seekers now and in the future.

Douglas, in the lounge downstairs where the little statue of Shiva was, there was a big bay window. He had painted the bottom ledge of the bay window in white, and he said if you move your hands over it, all the way from one end to the other, you'll feel cool. And it's true, it was so cool. That was painted by Shiva energy. Of course, there was another statue which was very impressive: the Kartikeya statue, which was in the other drawing room. The whole house just vibrated with so much peace and so much fragrance. It's like when you go to India sometimes and you go to a place which is full of marble and perfume; it reminds you a bit of Shri Mataji's house.

The other thing that I loved was the fact that we were like kids, just moving around and following Mother wherever she went. I was 23 then, but we were just like kids with Shri Mataji. She was explaining everything, and what was amazing was that she never used a mug. She always gave tea to her guests in a cup and saucer. She always asked a servant to bring some pakoras, some snacks. Shri Mataji had a very sort of princely way of receiving people. It was just amazing, and we came from really very modest backgrounds. We were just university students. Gregoire used to say we were all barefooted students.

Shri Mataji and CP, they funded and they financed so much, even the trips. Even when we went to a seminar, Shri Mataji paid for everything. She transported us. I think we didn't have any travel budget or anything like that. That started later, maybe a year or two. We didn't even think about it.

We went to St Albans, we had that seminar. We did go and visit Shri Mataji when CP was abroad. We went to meet her in Hersham Green and stayed with her. During one of these evenings, we were around that dining table and Shri Mataji was talking. At some point she said, "You know, down the road," that road that leads to her house, "there are deities guarding my house, and they're checking that no one comes." She said they're really guardians of her house. Then she immediately said, "You know that house in St Albans where we had the seminar? The deities weren't there before. They came to the seminar, visited the house, made sure that everything was okay." And then she said, "Of course, the deities do stay there for a few more days before leaving." That's probably why when Shri Mataji leaves a place, it's like a train she leaves behind her, and you feel those vibrations for quite a few days and feel her fragrance, which I thought was quite amazing.

The other thing that I always remember, I tell my wife about it, is when Pat came to St Albans with Kevin. They were all playing with water guns. Typical. I remember Pat saying, "We went to this place and we started shooting at these ducks, giving them self-realization." The funny thing was, there was one colleague of mine who came around, and he was going somewhere else. He saw Pat and Kevin running about and he said, "This is not normal." I was laughing because I thought it was so great that a father and son were just running around and playing like kids. He was a bit surprised. But it was an amazing time that we had in St Albans and all the other stays we had with Shri Mataji.

We went into the cathedral with Mother then, at St Albans.

Exactly. We went in and Shri Mataji knelt down in respect and reverence to St Alban, whom she said was a guru, a Roman soldier who was beheaded by the Romans for his Christian belief.

Tell us more about the cloth of Gagangiri Maharaj that he gifted to Shri Mataji, and then you...

Shri Mataji was all the time, most of the time, working on my Nabhi, which is not surprising for someone coming from a Muslim background. I think I suffered from a bout of black magic when I was a kid, and at least that's what she confirmed. What happened was, she wanted to tie a dhoti around my body. So she said, "Go to my cupboard and get a sari." I went to the cupboard and I picked up one sari haphazardly. When she saw it, she said, "Okay, that's Gagangiri Maharaj's." So she tied it, and I was a bit shy. I said, "Shri Mataji..." I had to take my trousers off. She said, "I won't look, don't worry. I'll put the sari on without looking." I was so embarrassed, but she put the sari on, she tied it, and there's a picture of that. I have to send it to you all. I think it was taken by Maureen.

I think one of the things is that Shri Mataji literally chose us from different backgrounds, and she said that we each represented something that she had to work out in mankind. So we all had very different sorts of things, either problems or backgrounds. I mean, Pat and I are brother and sister, but we still had quite different problems, if you like. We'd been through different things. We'd both been through broken marriages before coming to Sahaja Yoga. Pat had his son, and we were examples of people who were seeking in a certain way, I suppose. And then Gavin and Jane, and Jamel, and Douglas—a very intelligent man, but he'd suffered greatly. Tony, Greg, very different again. It was an interesting thing. Marie from France, and Gregoire. All sort of levels of society and backgrounds. Although Pat and I were in squats as hippies when she met us, we came from a reasonable background. Our parents had been abroad and worked in the civil service. So it was just all sorts.

Could you explain briefly what hippies and squats are for audiences who are not familiar with the term?

Well, at that time, I mean, it started really in the 60s, didn't it, Pat, the hippie movement. It was young people generally, although not always so young, who had gotten really fed up with the material world and they felt the zeitgeist. They were misled by people with drugs, as that was the way to seek, if you like. The drugs opened them up to the idea that God existed as an experience in everything. But they went into it completely unprepared and without any real knowledge, just opening up all their subtleties willy-nilly to all kinds of things around them. We were trying to live outside of society while being in squats, which is in society. It was pretty much on the edge of society. We were using other people's properties, other people's electricity. It didn't occur to us. We saw everything as belonging to everyone, so nobody had any right to charge anything for it.

Have you read Gregoire's book about the world before everything went into dissolution? All the higher beings and all the seekers and how they lived this perfect existence, and then they came down to be born. To me, it always felt like he was describing them being machine-gunned. They came down in all innocence to be here for Mother's coming and just got absolutely caught like spiders in a web. We were seeking and we didn't imagine it was bad. We didn't know there were any dangers. You just were giving everything up to find yourself. Working was a distraction, money was a distraction. It was on the right lines, but it was all twisted. It's a bit like Mother says that things come from the unconscious, but if you're not straight, they come via the subconscious and the superconscious, so they get twisted. You see the thing, but it's like in a distorted mirror, so you take the wrong choice.

But also, the scene was set by the divine for seekers to be able to have that much freedom, to think they could just give up their jobs and go around. Can you imagine the 50s? People went to work and that was it. There was absolutely no question. Mother said when she first came to England, everything was black and white: bowler hats, suits, umbrellas. And then suddenly, it's like the color came, but with it came this sort of "anything goes." What was it Mother said? People said, "So what? What's it matter?" And that's what came in. People had that sort of "Why can't you do what you like?" I went off to try and go to India before I met Mother. Luckily, I got saved and came back and met her here. But a lot of seekers were damaged. And then, of course, you've got the false gurus turn up. If Shri Mataji had come instead of the false gurus, there would have been no problem. But of course, the false gurus always know when she's going to come, and so they come before and ruin the seekers.

Let's look at this photo at Finchley Ashram. There's the Shri Ganesha statue.

Yes, that's the famous Shri Ganesha statue that you felt the vibrations from. This is the front room where we always met Mother. It seemed huge because it was always full of people, but it wasn't that big. It was our meditation room in the ashram.

Oh, that's a nice picture. We used to look through the candle at her. So we're all looking at Mother's Agnya on her forehead through that flame to clear our Agnya. I think that's in Mother's house because you've got the tea set.

That's the pose that Mother would take at the end of the puja, just as she did later. For the benefit of people just coming into Sahaja Yoga, what is that mudra with her hands?

She's giving blessings. Her hand held up is protection. "I will support you." The left hand is giving nourishment and the right hand is protecting. She always took that pose at the end of the puja just for the vibrations.

You forget, but everything that happened was like a new book, like we were reading a story for the first time. As Pat said, there was no one to tell us. We didn't know any mantras. There were no mantras.

I noticed her little finger is separated from the other fingers.

Yes, quite often Mother would do that.

This was Bath, wasn't it? I kept... I couldn't understand how the artist could study Mother's face to draw her and not be absolutely... he couldn't, could he? He complained. He said that her face was so subtle that he was having difficulties fixing it.

It was on the way back from the seminar. That was the time we went to Avebury, wasn't it?

Did she comment on the stones?

She was saying, "This stone is Shri Ganesha. Feel the vibrations of this one, and this is joined to that one," and stuff like that. I don't remember the details. She said to Gregoire, she gave him her lipstick and said, "Draw a swastika on that stone on the right-hand side when we went in."

It's perhaps important to remind the viewers that the auspicious symbol here is the swastika. It's a very sacred, auspicious symbol from ancient times that was stolen by the Nazis and used in reverse for evil. In more recent times it's associated with Nazis, but it couldn't be more wrong.

This is right before or after Saraswati Puja in Finchley Ashram, apparently from what the photograph is telling us. All of you seem to be in this state of joy. There are so many smiling faces there.

This is Mother turning someone's Agnya with her Agnya finger there. She used to do that, put her finger on the Agnya and then turn it.

That was the giant candle that Tony got, that blackened the ceiling. There it is! A great big church candle, and it covered the carpet in wax. It took us ages to get it out afterwards.

Do you remember what the owner of Finchley said when we were about to move out? He looked at the meditation room and said, "God, it's all black!" That candle made everything—the curtains, everything, the ceiling—all black. The first day we moved in, it was the same thing. The guy you knew called the fire brigade because of the potatoes in the oven, and the fire brigade turned up. The landlord came and the whole place was full of smoke from clearing the place with ajwain. All sorts of things went crazy.

I think Mother must have talked him around every time.

Well, it was Mother that found the ashram and paid the first three months rent. This was the third ashram in effect, then? Well, we lived at Gavin and Jane's for a while, but that wasn't exactly an ashram. Acton Lane was the first one, and then Regents Park Road. It was here that Gregoire stayed and wrote The Advent for Shri Mataji to revise. That's where I typed The Advent. We used to go every morning to Ashley Gardens, and I had to re-type it every day.

Oh, thank you for joining us again. We took a little pause because our guest Jamel had to leave, and we have Pat's dear wife, Greshna. Greshna, thank you for joining us. Maureen, thank you for staying with us. And Pat, let's listen to the story you were just talking about, one of the yogis in the picture, Gus, who was found by Shri Mataji. I think he was one of the first people that she rescued from the streets in London. Could you please paint the picture for us?

Well, he was ill. Mother took him back home and kept him there for six weeks at her own house. Her husband was horrified. He said, "This man is going to die in my house!" The CP came back and found him wearing his suit. He was speechless because Mother said that it would confuse the bhoots if she changed his clothes. It's a fact. She made us all wear smart clothes to get rid of our hippie bhoots, because the hippie bhoots wouldn't recognize us.

Jamel was saying how much work we all did in the early days. It was great fun and we wouldn't have missed it for the world. Some 10 years later, Shri Mataji was talking to me in Brompton Square and she said, "You know, you've done really well in Sahaja Yoga." I kind of thought, "Oh, done really well." Then she said, "Yes, you're still in it." She also said she put all the rough stones in the foundations. She said, "The foundation stones, they won't see them. There were some pretty flowers coming along in the future, but the foundation stones have to go below the ground and they have to be solid." And she also said they put all the rubbish as hardcore.

It was incredible to be there at that time and to hang on. We watched people come and go, and we weren't, I'd say, the best specimens, but we hung on.

I remember the first time I got really caught up, I caught two lots of flu, one after the other. Mother said, "You've gotten all caught up again and you're affecting other people in the ashram. I think you really ought to be sent away from Sahaja Yoga for a while, or it's going to cause problems." Then she said, "But I can't do it because I'm worried you'll get lost out there." I said, "No, no, I promise I won't get lost. You can send me out. Don't worry about it. I promise I'll be back." I got a bedsit a couple of streets away.

So you did actually remove yourself?

Oh yes. I threw myself out and worked on myself.

She put me out as well. I can remember standing there in her flat and she said, "Yes, I think you need to leave the ashram." Obviously, I looked devastated, so she came and stood next to me and whispered in my ear, "I have to say it like this." Then she came and stood in front of me again and said, "Yes, you must leave the ashram." So I felt completely okay because I knew that the two sides of her were there: the one that was sorting me out and the one that was looking after me regardless.

Quite often, she was saying that people improve when they are out of the collective for a while. Instead of putting their attention on other people, they put their attention on the connection with the divine, and so the negativity stops focusing on you.

In those days, Mother was still in contact, because everything was so small. It was also so intense, all that power focused on six or seven people. It was extraordinary. You're swimming in vibrations and all kinds of extraordinary things would be going on. I remember once Mother was talking to me and Gus, and she was just playing with her hands, and I could see this ball of energy between her hands, as if she was throwing it from one hand to the other. Another time she was talking and she seemed to be floating off the ground like a genie. It was just amazing, all of it. We just took it all for granted. Mother would ring up and say, "CP is going away for a few days, you can all come." We'd rush over to her house and have these really intense weekends.

It got harder later on, once the collective got bigger. Like Jamel was saying, when you had pujas, Mother would know exactly what was going on. Each one of you would have to come up to Mother's feet, put your head on her feet, and she would check your vibrations quite publicly. Everybody else would be putting in their two cents. I can remember being quite relieved in some ways when the collective got big enough to hide in. We didn't have to do that anymore.

When more seekers came in, especially the people from TM, their problems were really heavy. They were just howling like animals when Mother worked on them. Screaming, shouting. We had to turn the volume up in the ashram to drown all the screams from the neighbors. When we tried to say the mantras to clear their chakras, they'd scream literally like animals and roar and writhe in agony. It was really... it's like there was a big spotlight showing exactly what evil was. We'd never seen anything like it. In fact, Mother stopped it after a while, I think it was too much. But there was no doubt after that that it was evil.

You know, you can't really fully realize it. Sometimes when you're deep in meditation and you come close to realizing what was really going on, it just kind of shocks you. You're just stunned. You can't believe it. The power and the vastness of it all. The reality of being with God. It was so real, you couldn't not feel it. It was more the unreality of normal life that was hard to sort of... like that time Mother was in floods of tears over Christ's death, sort of reliving it. It was unbearable. It was so intense and so visceral. The fact that this was the divine talking about things that had just changed the whole world, and we were just there, like these little kids witnessing it. It was extraordinary.

So when was it, Greshna, that you got your realization? We were talking about you the other day, and it was mentioned how you were the first person from Poland, from behind the Iron Curtain, who got realization in England.

Yes, well, I came to England in 1977. I had difficulties leaving the country because I was on the blacklist, so I was not allowed to leave. I couldn't get my passport for seven years. In the end, in a miraculous way, I managed to get my passport. I came to England and I started to seek. Interestingly, on the second day of my arrival in London, I went to Westminster Abbey, next to the apartment where Shri Mataji lived. So I was actually there. Somebody took me there, and there was a mass. I went there because it was a mass for all the Eastern Europeans. I remember praying in the little chapel for the experience that I had in Poland. Maybe I can find something which would continue the experience, because I had this experience of being one with nature and the universe, in a way. I just disappeared.

If Mother had looked out of the window then, she would have been able to see you.

I am sure she must have heard my prayers. Because I was there. Then I stayed in the hostel in Holland Park—that's yet another place where, later on, there was a Sahaja Yoga program. I was seeking, going to different groups, doing meditation, Hatha Yoga, quite a lot of Hatha Yoga. Just before I was going to become a teacher, somebody told me about Shri Mataji, and I came to the program. I had a very strong experience. My seeking was finished. It was completely obvious. That's when I arrived. In 1980, I got my realization and haven't really looked back.

After my realization, I came to Shri Mataji's feet, because that's what was happening in Caxton Hall. I was looking up at Shri Mataji, and she said, "Your problem is Vishuddhi. Do you catch colds?" I said, "Yes." She said, "It will be okay soon." Still working on it, but yes. Soon is relative. Everybody looked after me. It was amazing.

What, in 1980? How many of you would have been there?

Well, what happened was that when we did the first public program, we jumped from seven people to about 70. That number remained fairly constant for quite a while, except the people used to change. Some people stuck on, and other people... but we were about 60 or 70. Mother did a program at Caxton Hall every Monday, if you can imagine. Every Monday. And once a month, we had the Great Hall.

The first time I came to the ashram, I walked straight into a full puja.

Yes, that was also interesting because Douglas was looking after the recording equipment. At the second meeting, Shri Mataji wasn't there. So I asked him, "Is there an ashram?" Because I was used to ashrams, you see. He said, "Well, yes." I said, "What is the address?" And he said, "Wow, I am not sure." He checked my kundalini and said, "Okay, I suppose I can give you the address." This was Dollis Hill Ashram.

So I came to the ashram. It was on the 5th of May, shortly after I got my realization. I walk in, and there were all these lemons in the garden. I was thinking they are cultivating lemons. Anyway, I walked in and everybody was waiting for something. It was Sahasrara Puja. I had no idea. Shri Mataji called me to do the puja, and the first thing I had to do was to draw a swastika on her feet. For a Polish person, I couldn't... but to me, after that, whatever Shri Mataji would ask me to do, I would just do without question.

So I did that. Then, I was asked to sit in the havan, and that was a thousand names with the translation. It took four hours. I had no idea how long it would take, but I was quite used to sitting on the floor at the time, so it was okay for me. Then there was a music program, so it all finished late at night. But I must say, I was floating after the puja, havan, and everything. For me, it was such a great introduction to Sahaja Yoga. The ultimate introduction.

Shri Mataji looked at me at the second or third meeting and she said to me, "Why are you sitting down? You have to give realization to people." From that moment, I never stopped. I just felt that's what I'm supposed to do. Probably nothing more important.

Tomorrow, you start the online "Let's Meditate" 21 Days program, and then the Ideal Home Show is coming up soon, on Shri Mataji's birthday, the 21st of March.

What I can't seem to get across to some yogis is what an amazing experience it is. It's like going to India. It's like a mini tour. You're there with yogis, and you're just giving realization, and you get better through the day. When we first did it, we were absolutely done in. After two hours, we had to go out and sit about. It's just mother's hands. It's an instrument of Shri Mataji. You can't express it unless it's done. Some people feel shy. They say, "What if I can't explain? What if I can't feel?" You just somehow got to get across to people that it's not you. It's absolutely not you.

We used to quite often have the shows during the puja time. We felt it was like a puja because the vibrations were incredibly strong. So we preferred to do that during the puja time, because it was like giving Mother something that she really wanted us to do.

You just get taken to another realm doing it. We have to save the world, so we have to hurry up.

So we did the Finchley Ashram, and then there was a mention of Dollis Hill Ashram. What's the next ashram then?

Chelsham Road. Chelsham Road was when Mark and I got married. We took the keys and opened it. That was the 25th of July, 1980, when Linda bought it. Pat and Greshna were married there. So that's Pat and Greshna, that's our wedding at Chelsham Road. It was the same year. We were building the meditation room at that time. We're standing in the meditation room, but it doesn't have a roof. It had plastic and balloons.

This is Chelsham Road. Who's that? It looks like Dawn in a wedding gown.

It might have been Dawn and Tony's. They were married before us. That might be Hester's flat. So that's before Chelsham Road.

I'm at the back in front of the window with a suit on. That's Mark with the red shirt on.

So we have Mark, Maureen's husband, joining us now. Thank you, Mark. Would you please tell us the story of the turban?

Right. Well, there was another wedding going on at the time in Paris, and the groom was a young Indian boy. In true Indian style, he looked like a Maharaja, the most gorgeous princeling you've ever seen. The family were there and they all looked fantastic, very well turned out. His costume was absolutely sumptuous. And I was stood there, a very skinny 21-year-old in a white cotton kurta and pyjama. And Mother said to me, "Where is your turban?"

And I'm thinking, "What do I say? I haven't got a turban, Mother." So Mother looked at me. "Here, take this." And she handed me one of her saris. I'd met Mother in 1979, so this was 1980. I stood there like this with Mother's sari in my hands. I was thinking, "What do I do with this?" And Mother obviously knew that, so she said, "Oh, give it to me." She put the turban on me.

As you can see, that's Mother's sari. She stood back a little, looked at me, and said, "Where's your brooch?" I'm thinking, "I haven't got a brooch." "Oh, use this." So she took the brooch from her sari. So that's Mother's sari brooch on the turban.

The ceremony was going on. Mother had found a pundit to do the ceremony, and he had the brightest, most electric orange clothes you have ever seen. It looked like he was plugged into the mains. He was talking, and I've never heard anyone speak so fast. It was like a hummingbird. You couldn't hear words. Just about everything he said, Mother said, "No, don't say that. Say this." She corrected him on just about everything.

We were tied together with garlands and a scarf, and we were walking around the fire. Every time we went around, we would kick a pile of rice away. As we were walking, I was probably sweating a lot. It was very warm in there. This turban starts going like that... another step... like that. I'm thinking, "This is my wedding, and everyone's going to remember my wedding for Mother's sari falling into the fire." I was like this. Another step. Mother said, "Stop." Everything stopped. She came and stood behind me, and that's the picture where she's putting my turban right so that it didn't end up in the fire.

After the ceremony, we were still tied together. The other couple, the groom was a young Indian boy, and there was like a fleet of Mercedes ready to whisk them away to a big reception somewhere. Mother said to Maureen and I, "What are you doing?" "Oh, we don't know, Mother." "Oh, come with me," she said. And so we were sat in the back of Mother's Mercedes, still tied together. We went to Mother's apartment in Ashley Gardens, right beside Westminster Cathedral. She showed us to one of the guest bedrooms. So Maureen and I just sat like this, like a pair of lemons, still tied together, still with all the gear on.

Either Mother came in to see us or we went out. She untied us. "No need for that anymore." Then she was watching a film on the telly, and she said, "Oh, come and watch it. She's really good." It was a film with Bette Davis. So we had tea with Mother and we went to bed.

The next morning, CP was at home. We had breakfast with Mother and CP, and he was absolutely lovely. In his official life, he was a top UN diplomat, but he was so nice to us. He said, "Thank you for staying your wedding night with us. It's so auspicious." We were just like, "Really? Thank you very much." We thought he was just being polite, but he was so genuine and so lovely about it.

Mother took a phone call from Linda Pierce, telling her that she'd signed all the papers for Chelsham Road. So Mother said, "Oh, you should go and pick the keys up. It's very auspicious for newlyweds to open the new house." So we went and got the keys, and we were the first yogis into Chelsham Road. We were the first occupants. And bizarrely, there was still someone in there. It was so weird. We walked in and there was a little old lady sat in an armchair in one of the upstairs bedrooms. Her father, I think, had started Cow & Gate, the baby food company. She was lovely. She was just waiting to be picked up by her son. It was just so strange. And that's the end of the wedding story and the turban story.

Thank you, Pat, Maureen, Greshna, for coming to this session of Golden Memories and taking us through the years to the beginning of Chelsham Road and the stories that you've shared with us. Thank you so much. We've got this meditation, the "Let's Meditate" program starting tomorrow, so we have an online meditation soon, plus we have some dinner to fix before that. It is so very sweet of you to join us and share your stories. Thank you so much.

No, it's great. Thank you so much for organizing this. It's amazing. Thank you for your time and for your efforts over the years, and for the photos you shared as well.

Jai Shri Mataji.

Jai Shri Mataji. Bye.
