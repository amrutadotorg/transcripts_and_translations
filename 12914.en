Where is Robbert? Robbert, where is he?
[Marathi]
Gavin? Hello, just a minute, just a minute. Jane and Gavin should be the parents of mister Malcom. So you go and sit with him. All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah...
Come along, come along you have to come here;
[Marathi]
Danya, you come and we’ll be there. [Marathi]
Now you have to look after her sari. You have to look after her things, whatever she needs. You are the bridesmaid. [Marathi].
You are her brother and you are the aunt. You see, it means her brother's wife. All right.
[Marathi].

[9:46]
Now the first ceremony is, she is the Gauri and she is the Kanya, she is the virgin, you see. And so she worships Me as a virgin, which is called as Gauri Puja, is done in every Vedic marriage, that Gauri is first worshipped as a virgin, because she should give her blessings to the bride of her chastity. And also the blessings that she will remain always loyal to her husband. And she prays at the feet of the Gauri that, "Make all the marriage ceremony nicely and everything should be done very well". This is the essence of it, that, "Let it pass my married life be all right". Because Gauri herself worshipped Shiva like this.

[Marriage ceremony starts with the maha mantra]

To Danya: Make her get up. You have to look after her now. All right? Get her, lift her up, lift her. I don't know. [Marathi].
Now you go and stand at her back. If she needs anything, your sari or anything.
You see, you should go [Marathi].

To someone: You go and stand on the other side now.

Now you all have to bring him along. This side is all girls' side. And the girl is not supposed to see the boy before wedding, though he is so tall, I don't know how we can do it!
[Laughter]
Now, may God bless you. Now stand here. Now, you have to stand there.

To Sahaja Yogis: Now whatever you have in your hand, you see, these are to be thrown seven times. So don't throw them at the same time. And when they say, ‘saava dhan’, then you have to put it. All right? And... This is called as Mangalashtakas. [Marathi].
So seven times they will be saying, and seven times you have to put little bit of this on them. You see, and then the girl will garland the boy so that she accepts him, then he can marry her. Not without her acceptance.
To Ophelia: You sit down here. Come along. Now what about you having something in your hand? Now sit down, sit down, sit down. Be careful. Now be careful. Now see the bride. Did you see the bride? Ah, see, that's the bride now.

To Sahaja Yogis: This is the most solemn thing. You see, this is ‘Swayamvara’ actually, where the girl chooses the boy, and accepts him as the husband. This is being translated in English. So, Rustom can read it beforehand and then will start singing it. Rustom, where are you? [Marathi].
Ah, Rustom, have you got it?
Rustom: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Come here. Yes. [Marathi].
Bhajji means the priest, you see, and we make a fun of that. So these two budgies are there, your third one. Ah, what's the name? First let me say in English. Are you telling English? What? And now this is the first one.
Rustom: This is a very special solemn thing to be written from ancient days [unclear] to Sahaja Yogis. And it’s called the Mangalashtaka. You have to vow Shri Maraji [unclear].
Shri Mataji: Now with both the hands like this.
Rustom: [Unclear]. The Kundalini is anxious to meet Shri Sadashiva and now the time has come to establish the Maha Yoga. To Sahu Kamakshi: your parents have consented to this marriage and your brother give you this present to spread your faith amongst the Sahaja Yogis. Shri Mataji is also there, to settle your marriage and to bring it to a great success. Our holy Shri Mataji also desires to convert this into a great family of Sahaja Yogis.
To Malcolm: due to your great good fortune, you have succeeded in getting such a gracious and lovely lady in Kamankshi as your wife, who will support your fame and spread it. We all Sahaja Yogis expect you both to spread Sahaja Yoga through your efforts, wherever you may reside. All the Sahaja Yogis from the world have guaranteed to witness your marriage. Such a marriage you need to be observed in this age. I wonder whether all the deities will come down from heaven to witness this wonderful marriage, and to receive the blessings in this age of the great Yoga. Jai Shri Mataji.

[Applause]

Shri Mataji: So, may God bless you both for a very happy and prosperous life.
To Danya: Just look after her.
You can put one foot down on the ground. Stay.
[Marathi].

To Ophelia: See the bride? Now, we'll see what are they doing. We'll see them. Just go and see. Be careful. Slowly, get down.

To Sahaja Yogis: Now, come and sit down here. All of you are from the boys' side, so you have to sit that side.

[The marriage proceeds...]

[56:30: Applause]
You have to give the blessings to the bride that she will always remain a married woman, because it's regarded as the biggest blessing to a woman to be married to one man all her life, till she lives.

Now you have to do the last part, all right? [Marathi]. You are not to leave her hand. All right? You can't walk off with leaving her hand. They are actually tied together with a knot. And every time they move out, they have to be careful about each other.
To Dany: You sit next to her.

1:08:45

You better take it. To suggest, you see, the brother of the bride has to pull the ears of the husband to say that, "Please take care of my sister". You see, so he has to just screw the ear a little. [Laughter] He's done it.

1:10:08

Saptapadi. Now they have to walk together seven steps,it’s called as saptapadi. Seven steps as the promises are. Sahaja Yoga [Marathi] promises.

Warren, have you got those seven conditions of marriage in English? Warren, have you got them? Can you bring them? It is better to say them in English. All right. [Marathi]

Come along, you read them one by one. You stand there.

Malcome has to be teached. [Marathi]

To Rustom: Then you stand there and tell the bride to say this. Repeat it. [Marathi]

1:13:06

First, how many are for the girls who have put in? Three. First three, she leads. You will come at the bride.

In Sahaja Yoga, we have given equal importance to husband and wife. So first the wife leads the husband and then the husband has to lead the wife, all her life. All right.

Rustom: These are the seven rounds that we present to all Sahaja Yoga marriages. The first three are led by the bride, the second three are led by the groom and the final one is set by both of them. So for the first step the bride should repeat after me:

"I will help you keep your Mooladhara chakra in order. You hand over all milk which is in your possession. I will take care of those things. You should only eat the food that is cooked by me or your brothers and sisters. And if taken outside the room, you will vibrate it. I will be loyal to you and you will be loyal to me".

Shri Mataji: This is the first promise between them.

Now you stand behind Her.

The bride: "[Unclear] I will bring you love and affection. I will obey you, you should help me with my work.  And I will help you in the work of Sahaja Yoga.

[A senior Sahaja Yogi gives a gift to the couple]
Shri Mataji: You must open and see that, what is in there. He is the most senior Sahaja Yogi that we have in the whole of the world. Senior most, senior most, son of mine.
[Presents are given to the couple]
[Shri Mataji is laughing]
Very good idea. Sit down.
[Presents are given to the couple]

1:39:10
To Danya: You should be with the bride. You should be with her, stand here. Just look after her shawl.

Rustom: Raulbai 
Shri Mataji: That is to the- you see, she is the sister in Sahaja Yoga of Mr. Pile.
Whatever she gives, you give it to him, he will write it down.
To Danya: Just see whatever she is given.
[Presents are given to the couple]
This is the sister’s [gift] to her brother because Raulbai and [unclear] Pile are brother and sister in Sahaja Yoga.
Sahaja Yogi: This bhandan is there for the last ten years.
[Shri Mataji is laughing]
Shri Mataji: Yes. On the bhandan, you see, the day when the brother-sister relation. is established, ten years back, he accepted her as a sister.
1:41:58

All the Sahaja Yogis come and come one by one and congratulate. All of you.
To the couple: And now you have to stand up for a while. Yes, that's the punishment.
He is the boss of Kamakshi.
