Welcome, Akbar, who's going to share with us some of his amazing early experiences in Sahaja Yoga tonight. So just to start, Akbar, how did you come to find Sahaja Yoga in the first place? When was that?

Hello to everyone. Before I start my experiences, I just wanted to thank Caroline and other yogis who are helping to support this beautiful memory of the old Sahaja Yogis. Really, thank you for your love and care and the time you put in for that. Thank you very much.

It's a pleasure and a privilege.

It is a little bit of a long story. When I finished my studies as an architect at Rome University, I started working in Rome for a couple of years, but somehow it was not easy to find a job. Then I searched out of Italy, and I found a job in Zimbabwe. So I said, "Okay, I'm going to Zimbabwe." Then they told me that from London, there are cheap flights to Zimbabwe because it's a colony of Britain. I said, "Okay, I'll go to London and spend some time there." Anyway, after a couple of weeks, I found a job as an architect. I found a beautiful house in Hampstead. It seems everything was just arranged because the house was a five-minute walk to Hampstead Town Hall. And then in front of my house was this Indian store, and behind my house was Hampstead Heath park.

Before that, I was searching for many years. I was traveling from one country to another, one book to another, but somehow I couldn't find anything. So for a couple of years, I was working there, and my seeking was getting stronger. I started having headaches and stomach problems. After work, I used to go to Hampstead Heath park and walk and just complain to the divine. "So what shall I do? I don't know what else to do. I didn't harm anybody. I didn't do anything wrong. All these thoughts, I cannot stop them. This doubt and this kind of unhappiness all the time." Every day I would go for three, four, five hours just walking like mad and talking.

Then one day I was just walking. Suddenly I heard a voice telling me, "The thing you are searching for is within you, it is not outside." I just couldn't move. I don't know, maybe a little movement of the Kundalini was there. I was so happy, so happy that, okay, if it's inside me, I will find it. I'm so tired of searching outside. I don't know, for maybe one hour, I couldn't move. But for the first time, I felt my feet were on the ground. It was a different kind of feeling I had never had before.

So from the next day, I would go walk and put my attention inside. What is inside? What is the search? Just talking to myself. And then I remembered the Sufis saying, "God is within you." So I was saying, "Oh God, where are you? What can I do? How can I contact you?" I didn't know what to do, just talking to myself all the time.

This went on for a couple of months. I went to the library and got all the sacred books: the Bible, the Quran, and books on yoga, and I studied those a little bit. Then I said, "Okay, if I have to start finding God, maybe it's through religion." Until I was 15 years old, my mother was doing this namaz, this Islamic prayer. My father was doing it, so I was doing it also. But one day I did the namaz and I saw that before namaz and after namaz, I was the same. Nothing was changing. So I left it. After all these years had passed, now I said, "Okay, I have to do this namaz."

I started doing namaz. And somehow you bend and you put your forehead on your knees and say some prayer. And I felt my Void was full of vibration. Something was happening there, and I didn't want to get up. I wanted to stay there. During my namaz, which would last for an hour, I felt lots of vibration happening.

For a couple of months, it was like that. Then one day, I was feeling so thirsty to worship God. I was feeling alone. I said, "Where can I go? There is a mosque and a church." I said, "I know this place is not the right place, but I was so thirsty." I said, "Okay, I'll go to the church." I went to the first church in Hampstead, and the door was closed. Oh God. All my life I see these doors are open, and now that I want to go, it's closed. I went to a second church, and the door was closed. I said, "Okay. God doesn't want me to go to the church."

So I came back to the house. In the afternoon I was going shopping. I knew the owner of the Indian store; he was a young chap and we were friends. As soon as I put my foot in the shop, I saw a small picture of Shri Mataji on the wall. For two years, this photo was there, but since I was not ready, like a chick in an egg for 21 days, I hadn't seen it.

So, I asked him, "Who is she?" He said, "Oh, she's curing." He didn't know exactly what was happening, but he said, "I can take you. Every Thursday they have a program there." I said, "Yes, please."

So I went there. At that time, there was this little guy, John, who was doing the introduction. And he was talking about what's inside. I was so happy. At least I could understand there are these channels, there are chakras, because I didn't know anything about it. I was so happy. When we finished, I just jumped up and hugged him. I said, "Thank you. It seems I have found whatever I was searching for for many years."

Then they put on Shri Mataji's talk. And her talk... it seemed all the cells of my brain were rusted, and her talk was just clearing them. It's like that. This is it. So, I was so, so happy. Every week, I was the first person with a flower going there, sitting next to the cassette player because I was interested in Shri Mataji's talk. I was trying to learn a few phrases and practice them from the beginning. She was saying, for example, "Go and watch the trees and see how long you can watch without thinking." So, I was practicing, going to the garden and watching. Or when I was walking to the shops, looking at the nice clothes and things in the windows, I was practicing to see if I could be thoughtless while watching.

Anyway, three months passed. Every time I went, one of the people working on me was Fergie. Every time, he asked, "Do you feel this cool breeze?" I was saying, "What do you want? What is this cool breeze? I'm so happy I have found it." I was saying, "No, I don't feel it, but I'm so happy I found it."

After three months, one time I came back from the program. I went home and had my dinner. At 10:30 or 11 o'clock, I went to sleep. As soon as I put my head down, my eyes closed. And then, suddenly I felt like a cool drop of water on my Sahasrara, in the fontanelle bone area. My eyes were closed, I was so relaxed, and my thought process had stopped. My attention was exactly there. What's happening? I was not moving at all. So, this drop of water, like a heartbeat, became larger and larger and larger. After some time, my entire Sahasrara cooled down, but the rest of my body became hotter. I could feel very vividly this coolness coming down.

It came down, down, down. All my head was cool. I didn't feel the weight of my body, and I was just enjoying this. It came down to my heart. Suddenly, like when you put the TV on and the image comes, I saw my heart in the palm of both hands. My eyes were closed, but I could see. This is my heart. It's palpitating. It's full of light. And I could see all the veins. I was so full of doubt about this being my heart. I said, "Let me see if the palpitation is the same to make sure." I listened to my heart's palpitation and saw it was the same. This coolness stayed for a long time in my heart.

When the heart had cooled down, as soon as the coolness went down further, the image went away. It came down, down, down, until it reached my toes. All my body was cool. And as soon as my body got cooled down, then I felt the chakras palpitating, jetting out heat. I felt better and better. I could feel exactly where the chakras were. This was going on and on. After some time, I just opened one eye and saw the sunlight coming from the window. I said, "No, it's not possible." I opened my eyes. It was 3 o'clock the day after. So, it took 17 hours. It was still working, but I had to go to work.

I came down from the bed and suddenly, I remembered in the Bible it was written about baptism, that you have a second birth. And it was exactly like that because I was feeling like a newborn. Like a baby without any of my problems, thinking, doubt, nothing, no thoughts. I was babbling with joy. For four days, it was like this. Day and night, these seven chakras were palpitating, clearing up. And I was just in the realm of joy.

Then after one month, Shri Mataji came. The first program was in...

Akbar, what year was that? What year was that?

This was '82. 1982. Then, after the program, the Sahaja Yogis went to Shri Mataji. They said, "Shri Mataji, we found a Muslim." Shri Mataji was laughing. She said, "Come here." I sat there. With her hand, she massaged my Sahasrara. She said, "Oh, he's okay."

After four days, I was in the train with Shri Mataji and two other yogis. We were four people going to Brighton for the Buddha Puja. I was only four months in Sahaja Yoga. I was so happy with myself because it was a totally new life, and Shri Mataji was sitting in front of me. We went to Brighton. For five days, we were with her, doing puja, going shopping with her. After that, I said, "I have to go around the world to bring this message because I know everybody has problems," because I was traveling a lot.

So, I said, "Let's start from Italy. I have to go back to Italy because I knew many people there, friends and things." From there, we started. Shri Mataji wanted to make a school, so we had to find the ashram, the first ashram in Rome. And after that, she wanted me to buy an ashram. So, this was the story of my self-realization.

What other experiences did you have with Shri Mataji that you can tell us about, Akbar?

My experience was when I first sat with her in Hampstead Hall. She said, "What are you doing?" I said, "I'm an architect." She said, "Oh, one day you have to build a house for me." Years passed. Nothing happened. Pakistan was built. Then we started Sahaja Yoga in Istanbul. At the first program, there were many people. After three weeks, there were about 50 people still coming for follow-up. We said someone has to stay and take care of them. So, I said that as it's a Muslim country, maybe I have to stay. For nine months, we rented an apartment and I was doing the programs.

After nine months, we invited Shri Mataji to come there. When she came, she was very happy about the new seekers. She said, "Oh, you have to come to India and build a house for me." She never forgot anything. So, I went to India. And this was amazing because there was another architect in India, so we were two architects. We went to measure the plot and came to her. We put a small little table for her with a pen and paper. We put the measurements of the plot in front of her. We told each other, "We don't suggest anything. Whatever she says, 'Ji, ji.'"

She started planning. "Okay. Bedrooms are here. These are windows. The stairs are here. And the bathrooms are here." For four or five hours, she planned this five-story building. But you could see somehow the staircase didn't go there. But she was asking, "It's okay, the staircase here?" "Ji, ji." So, we came and put it on the plan. The next day, we went there. "The staircase is not here, it's here. The bedroom is not there, it's here." She changed everything. For five hours. So, we came back and put it on the plan and went back there. Every day, we went there until little by little, you could see, "Oh, this is a great idea." She made a way to get the light into the center of that building. The building is in Noida. It was a private house for her.

Anyway, after 16 days, it was nearly done. Everything was nicely done without us saying anything. She did everything. At the end, when we finished, she said, "Ah, these architects, they have some concept in their head. The staircase should be there. The bathroom should be there. But building a house is like a woman who wants to have a child. It takes nine months until the baby is completed. So, the building is the same. I have to put the bedroom there first, then the staircase there, then see how it's coming, then change it. I have to create. Otherwise, these architects have concepts in their heads." That was amazing. She also did the engineering part, which kind of rebar to put in. It was amazing.

After that, I was there for two years until the structure of the building was finished. And after two years, she said, "Okay, come to Milan. I want to buy a castle." So, I came. We went to Milan every day. We went to see different castles. We found one real castle on two floors, high ceilings, all painted. Very nice, with nice old furniture and 90 bedrooms. It was really a castle. So, she asked us, "You like it?" "Yes, Shri Mataji, we like it." "Okay. Bargain. Buy." This would take a few days for the practical things to happen. In the meantime, she said, "Let's go to see other places."

Then we ended up in Cabella. Her car was this Lincoln, and it couldn't go up that road. She said, "Okay, I'll sit here in the car. You guys go and see." I stayed with her while the others went up there. They came back with their faces all down. "So, how is it?" "Shri Mataji, it's all broken and small compared to the other one." She didn't say anything. My experience is that she knew every single thing; she was just playing with her children and enjoying. She didn't say anything.

So, she said, "Okay, let's go buy some furniture." She still hadn't bought anything, and we were going to buy furniture. We found a huge five-story building. One floor was beds. One floor was dining rooms and chairs. One floor was cupboards. She just didn't stop walking. We were writing: four single beds, two double beds, chairs, tables, a big list. For two or three hours, we were just going up and down.

Now, Guru Puja was coming. She wanted to do the Puja in the garden of the castle. It happened for some reason that we couldn't buy that big castle. So, quickly she said, "Let's go to Cabella." She came there. The mayor of Cabella had a jeep, so we went up. In one hour, she bought Cabella. And then for the Puja, somehow we organized everything there by the river. Not exactly all those furnishings she bought, but we can see Cabella is just right for today. This was another episode.

Akbar, before you continue, I seem to remember a little Ganesha Puja on the lawn at the back of the castle, even before Guru Puja. Do you remember that?

This was after. The first one was on the river. We rented a place, put up a tent, and it was there. Then we did a Puja in the back of the castle. A little one just on that lawn outside, yes.

Another story was buying the Rome ashram. She was in Rome, and I was the driver. The day before she was coming, I thought I would go and buy a new suit. So, I would have a new suit when I went to the airport. I went to one road close to my house, from one shop to another, but nothing was my size. I couldn't find anything. And this was at 8 o'clock when the shops were closing. I reached the end of the road. Then I said, "Okay, maybe Mother doesn't want me to buy a suit." I went home, toward the car. The road was a bit dark because all the shops were closed. When I reached my car, I saw a plastic bag hanging from my door handle. I said, "Somebody made a mistake. Shall I wait and see if somebody comes?" I waited 10 minutes. Nobody came and nobody was on the road. I just went there and looked a little bit in the bag. It was some clothes. Again, I waited another 5 minutes and nobody came. So, I took it home. It was three suits in my size. Because my legs are short, I always have to shorten my pants, but these fit perfectly.

After the airport, we brought her to Rome. She was there for about one week, and at that time, we had 100 children, two or three years old. On the departure day, she had a flight, I think, at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. Usually, she would get up at 7 or 8, have tea, and talk to people. She'd have a shower, then breakfast, then she'd be ready. So now, it's 9 o'clock, 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock, and she's still not moving. She still hadn't had breakfast or a shower. Then somehow, she went for a shower and had breakfast.

Now, we had an hour and a half. A hundred children were waiting outside with flowers. We were shaking. The flight time was coming. So, we came out, she was hugging the children, taking flowers. By the time she sat in the car, we had one hour. She went to sleep. We were going 180, 190 kilometers an hour. Ten kilometers from the airport, there was an accident, so all the cars had stopped. In Italy, there is always a lane for police and emergency vehicles, so we put the car there, with all the lights on, and we were going 100 kilometers an hour.

We just reached the airport and we saw all the yogis were outside. I felt that something had happened because usually, most of the people are inside. As soon as I braked, she just woke up. She said, "What's happening?" Someone rolled the window down, and they said, "Shri Mataji, the flight is cancelled." "Okay. Let's go have lunch." So, we went to a fish restaurant. Very nice. We had lunch, and there, we saw an advertisement for the Rome ashram. It was a big project. We went inside. We asked her, "Shri Mataji, shall we go see this place?" She said, "Yes."

We went to the ashram. She sat in the car. She said, "Oh, I have already seen it. You go and see." So, we went to see, and it was perfect. It had many rooms, a big hall, and all these Roman arches. Very nice. And a big land also. So, we came out. "Shri Mataji, it's perfect." Then she said, "Go see the other building." There were two buildings. The owner couldn't sell it because it was too huge, so he divided it in two. She said, "Go see the other one also." We did. She said, "Okay, bargain." So, then somehow we got the ashram. These are a few episodes and stories with her. She knew exactly what was happening.

Do you have any special miracle stories to tell us, Akbar?

My miracle stories are a lot. I'll just say a few of them. This was when I was living in Cabella, and she was going to Los Angeles. I was at the airport, and 50 or 60 leaders were there also after the puja. Before her departure, she called me and said, "When we come to Los Angeles, I want to talk to you about Iran." Now, I'm living in Cabella, I see her often, but no. I knew because there are many Iranians there also. Anyway, I went much earlier, did programs, and had an interview on TV. It was a big program, very nice.

I went to see her in the house. She had asked me to go and see her, but I didn't want to trouble her. I didn't have anything that I had to see her about. But a fellow went up there and said, "Akbar is here." She just said, "Oh, Akbar the king. Tell him to come up." And this was in 2003, exactly the time when her health was coming back. I'll never forget that. She was so happy, amazing. The C.P. was there, and she was saying, "Oh, he's doing so much for Sahaja Yoga." I said, "Please, Shri Mataji. This message, you brought it for us. This love is so great, you cannot hold it in."

At the end, she said, "These Iranians are very dharmic people, open-hearted. So, lots of seekers are there. We have to try to save as many as we can." I said, "I promise you, I will do my best." From that time, I used to go to Los Angeles, stay for three months, come back for two or three weeks, then go back for three months. For two years, I did a lot of programs in different cities.

Then one time in immigration, they caught hold of me. They put me in one room, and they didn't tell me what was happening. But I knew. They go into the computer, they see I've been there for two years. "What is he doing?" These are a few experiences I had that really taught me about surrendering, what it means to surrender.

I arrived there at 6 o'clock in the evening. Now it's 10 o'clock at night. They didn't tell me anything. It's 12 o'clock. I felt that the next day they were going to send me back. It's 1 o'clock. I just said, "Okay, let me meditate." In that kind of vibration, there were police, very serious stuff. I just, I don't know, for 5 or 10 minutes I was meditating. The Kundalini was so strong. And suddenly, I felt my heart was full of joy. My body had joy. I felt, okay, if they want to send me back, it's good. Because my family is there. Here, I have to run here and there. It works. A kind of real surrender. Because until 1 o'clock, my attention was, "Oh, I came all this way. What is happening?" You know, this ego.

But in that moment... now you see how the divine plays. I opened my eyes and I saw all these police officers had changed. When did they change? I don't know. It was 5 minutes of meditation. And this African-American lady, a police officer, was sitting there. So, I just jumped up to her. I said, "You know, we are teaching meditation and this energy will awaken, and you enter this state of thoughtless awareness." She said, "What? Thoughtless? How can I be thoughtless? I'm getting crazy. I have so many thoughts. I don't know what to do." I said, "It's so easy. You want to try?" She said, "Yes." Okay. Now, all these police officers are watching me. I said, "Open your hands and close your eyes." So, I worked on her. Her Agnya was very bad. So, I opened her Agnya and pushed. The Agnya opened, and she just went. I said, "Stay as long as you want. Enjoy." For nearly 20 minutes, she was in that state. She opened her eyes. "What did you do? There's no thought." I said, "This is what I'm doing." "So, this is my business card. We have a hall in Los Angeles. You can go there. It's free of charge." She said, "Why are you here then?" I said, "That's why we are here. I don't know what they think. I'm coming here just to teach meditation." She said, "Wait. I'll go and see what they have written for you." After 5 minutes, she came back. She said, "Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry from the immigration department. You are free. You want a car? We can give you a car. You want a telephone? This is the telephone. I'm very sorry." Five times she said she was sorry.

So, I had a few episodes that showed me what surrendering really means. Then you are in the realm of the divine, and She can do anything. She is God Almighty. She can change everything.

Another episode was about London. I was living in Los Angeles while my children were in the Rome ashram, studying there. Three months before Christmas, I said, "Okay, I'll come for Christmas time and spend time with you." My children were happy. I got my ticket, and two weeks before my departure, my son called me. He said, "Oh, there is a Yuva Shakti seminar in London. Shall we go there?" I said, "I'm coming there to spend time with you. Are you going there?" But then I said, "Yes. You will enjoy it more there with me." Anyway, I said I would come to London first.

Our flight arrived in London, and the captain announced, "There is so much fog, they don't allow any plane to land. But they told us we will circle for 10 minutes, maybe something will happen." Already, I was feeling, "Oh, London. The children are coming there. Christmas time." I was happy within myself. And after 10 minutes, the captain said, "Okay, they gave permission only to us because we are coming from far away, from America." So, the plane landed. I entered the airport, and it was full of people. Everybody was angry. All the flights were cancelled. I'm so happy. I went to see what was happening. They said that for five days, this fog would be there. All the flights were cancelled for five days. "So, here is a voucher for a five-star hotel. This is money for your traveling. This is for eating." So, for five days, we were there. We went to the seminar and we spent Christmas time with them.

Do you have more of these stories?

Yes, please. Yes, please.

Another time was an India tour. Whenever I went on the tour, they used to give me a bus. There were so many buses: Krishna bus, Ganesha bus. This was the Akbar bus. It was famous. In this bus, there was no eating, no sleeping, only bhajans. All these musicians, joyful people, they were there. Really, it was particular.

This one year, it was a very nice tour, and everybody told me, "Come on, you have to go." I said, "There's no money. I cannot." This was two months before. Time to time, they would call, but nothing happened. This is another example of surrendering. Two days before the tour started, I just surrendered. I said, "Oh, two days, not possible anymore." Because always the desire was, "Mother, some miracle, one thing..."

I was clearing up my office, papers, and things. In those days, they used to give you a booklet from the bank, showing how much you have, how much you spend. And whenever I changed my residence, I didn't close my account; I just opened another account next to my place. Somehow, four or five of these booklets came down into my hand. I opened one. Five euro, ten euro, five euro, ten euro... three thousand euro. Three thousand euro! In those days, if I had three thousand euro, I could not forget. Somehow, I said, "Okay, if three thousand euro is there..."

But I had an Iranian passport. To get the Indian visa usually took three or four days in those times. I said, "If this is happening, let's go see what's happening." So I went to the Indian embassy. I asked, "Is it a bit urgent?" He said, "When do you want it?" I said, "Tomorrow." He said, "Come this afternoon, it will be ready." This three thousand was exactly the right amount to enjoy shopping and paying for the tour. Still, I don't know from where this three thousand came. And the bank didn't complain.

Another one. So many. I was on an India tour. Something happened, and I had to come back to Italy one week early. Everybody was saying, "No, we cannot change your ticket. It's too difficult. Don't go." I said, "No, I have to go. I know something will happen." I went to the Delhi airport for an Air France flight. I went there and said, "There's something urgent. I have to go back." He said, "It's impossible. People have been waiting for 24 hours." I said, "I have to go." He said, "There is no possibility." I said, "Can I talk to your manager?" The manager came. I said, "Look, I have to go. It's a real emergency for me." "No, it's not possible. Wait until the end and see what's happening."

At the end, before they closed the door, he came and said, "Oh, there is one place." So he gave me the ticket. I went there and sat down. A lady was sitting there. I mean, can you believe how it's possible? It never happens. They gave one seat to two people. I saw the number she had and I had was the same. So the stewardess came and said, "What's happening?" She checked it out. "OK, you come with me." She took me to first class. I sat there. First time. From India. It was the most joyful flight of my life.

Do you have any more miracle stories or do you want to just share some of the experiences that helped you go deeper, Akbar?

I think we'll go to that because it's getting closer to ending.

I don't think anybody is bored by your stories.

Thank you. The most important thing in my life is studying. I saw that when I was listening to her, after two or three days, I wouldn't remember anything. I couldn't absorb it. The divine came with all this pure knowledge of God Almighty. She chose us as employees. So our job, which I understood, is that I go to her talks and find all these phrases, all these words which are the pure knowledge of the divine. And I read them again and again, 50 times, 100 times, 200 times. Then I absorb those vibrations.

What happens? First of all, I feel the joy, because all these words, all these phrases of hers, give you joy. And also, the Sahasrara is open. So whatever I learn, from my Sahasrara, goes to the ether and goes all over. Now the human beings who are ready, they can absorb it, they can grasp it, even if they don't come to Sahaja Yoga. They grow with my growth. All human beings can grow. This first thing has really helped me a lot throughout these 40 years of my Sahaja Yoga life.

Another thing I learned is that Shri Mataji is also in our sacrum bone. She's there. All the deities are within ourselves. So I learned that as much as possible, I just bring my attention within myself. Every day in the morning, I close my eyes, put my hand on my sacrum bone, and talk to her. "Shri Mataji, thank you for giving us this big blessing. Are you happy? Are you okay?" Just talking with her. Then to the Swadishthana, Brahmadeva and Saraswati. Just like that, I can feel those vibrations which are within me.

Then, little by little, as I grow in Sahaja Yoga, I can really feel that this Akbar really cannot do anything. Because from childhood, my ego and superego are like a tape recorder. I record, "I like this," and "This is the sun," "This is the color blue." It is a tape recorder; it doesn't have any power. So, what I'm doing during the day, whatever I do, I remind myself, "You are not doing it." Then, suddenly, you become thoughtless. Then, I make this Mother Kundalini work. In reality, she is doing everything. She is digesting my food. She is breathing for me. She is running my heart. She is taking care of my liver, my kidney, 300 billion cells working within me. Akbar cannot do anything, cannot move my finger. All is done by her.

When I cook, I just say, "Shri Mataji, you are going to cook." When I eat, I say, "I have to give food to all these deities which Shri Mataji has placed within me." Then, this feeling of respecting yourself, loving yourself, develops within us. And this is always within me. So, wherever I go, I feel good. I feel so peaceful and joyful. This kind of altar is there, but that altar we have to build within ourselves, I learned. And whenever we go, it is with us. This is also a beautiful play, when we can just watch through this thoughtless awareness, and maybe a little bit in doubtless awareness. Then you don't have any doubt about yourself, that you don't do any single thing. Then you surrender. When I surrender, then I feel so much blessed. She's doing everything. Whatever is good for my life, for my growth, is happening. Because then you become a citizen of her kingdom. When you are a citizen of the Divine, then She will take care of everything. And I really don't know how to thank her. Every walk of my life, I just bow within myself. I just say, "Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you for giving us this beautiful life." Somehow, you don't have any desire. You don't want anything because She's fulfilling you totally.

And you're still going around the world giving realization to Iranians, mainly, isn't it?

Yes, mainly Iranians. Recently, for three months, we went to Europe: from Germany, Holland, Belgium, then Scandinavia, to different cities. We went 10,000 kilometers with a car because now Iranians are everywhere. That's why Shri Mataji knew at that time. She told me, "Take care of the Iranians." Then we came back, then we went again to Los Angeles. And again I went around and did so many projects. Now, I'm coming to London in June. We have some programs in Hampstead. And I have to go to Paris. There are thousands and thousands of Iranians in these places. So, as long as I can walk, I can talk, I just try to give this message, which is amazing.

I can see it wherever I do programs. When you see the eyes of these people... I don't know, these Iranians are so particular. As soon as I talk to them, "As this energy will awaken, you feel this coolness," I can see the Kundalini in their eyes. Many. I never saw it anywhere else. I don't know. Maybe Iran is in the map of the Divine in a special place. I don't know. But she always, whenever she saw us, she talked about Iran. It was the first place she gave collective self-realization in 1970.

I did not know that.

Yeah. The first place she gave self-realization was there because her brother, Baba Mama, was there. In 1970, she went to visit him. And Baba Mama had a friend, a colleague. So one day they made everyone gather there. They wanted to know about this meditation, and she gave self-realization. A couple of times she asked me, "Are those people still coming?" I don't know. I'm not there.

So, somehow we still just have a few minutes left. Does anybody have a question for Akbar?

I think everybody's just blown away by your stories, Akbar.

Maybe for a couple of minutes we can meditate?

Yeah, sure, please.

So, we just close our eyes. Let's put both our hands on the sacrum bone. Just bring our attention to our sacrum bone. We just thank Shri Adi Shakti, Shri Mataji, for choosing us as Her children, as Her disciples, as Her employees. And try to feel this amazing power of Hers. See if we can feel it rising so nicely, so smoothly. You have to make Her work. In reality, She is doing all the work. But if we make Her work, then we will develop Her. We will develop our Kundalini. Otherwise, we are developing our ego.

Now, we put our hand on our heart and try to feel the Spirit, which is always Shri Mataji Herself. If we can feel the joy come out of our heart. We thank Her.

Now, we bring our right hand, with the palm, on our Sahasrara. Just try to massage Her Lotus Feet in our Sahasrara. Just feel She is sitting in our Sahasrara. And also, She is sitting in the Sahasrara of all these human beings. The human beings, they think they are doing this, they are doing that. This one is the President of America, the other one makes a war, this and that. But they don't know they cannot move one finger. It is such a lila, such a drama, such a play. It is amazing.

Now, we can bring our hand down. And for a few moments, let's become one with this silence which prevails throughout the whole universe. This is the power of our Divine Mother. Become one with this. Let's get lost.

This last step to our evolution, She chose us as instruments. At the Big Bang, the Adi Shakti separated from Sadashiva. Now, when we raise our Kundalini, we raise the Adi Shakti. We make Them meet with Sadashiva. It means one cycle of our evolution is ending when our Kundalini is established in our Sahasrara. Such a responsibility. Such a beautiful play. We are so important for the Divine. We have to make Them meet as much as possible.

Thank you, everyone. Thank you for listening.

You can raise our Kundalini. It is knowledge that we are meeting the Adi Shakti with Sadashiva. Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you, Akbar. I should be listening to this talk again, especially to your tips on going deeper. I found I need to take those in again. Definitely. Thank you so much.

Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody.

Thank you, Akbar.

Thank you.
