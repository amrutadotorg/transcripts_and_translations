Hello, Jai Shri Mataji again. We took a short break, so we'll continue with your stories of some dreams. We'll continue on, and you were about to tell us about something special at Kurukshetra.

Yes. I'm pretty sure it was the 1993 India tour. It could have been the 1997 India tour. Either way, on the tour of these immeasurably significant spiritual sites, we went to Kurukshetra, which I understand is in Haryana, north of Delhi. This is the site... you're going to tell us why this is special?

Well, it features in the Mahabharata. That's where the Battle of Mahabharata took place, which was a big battle of ballistic proportions between tens of thousands of opposing armies: the Pandavas, supported by Sri Krishna playing the role of charioteer for Arjuna, opposing the Kauravas, who were the baddies, you could say. The Adharmic cousins.

That's an incredibly simplistic way to put it. But I just wanted to touch on where I was talking about the divine pitching it at the middle classes—which you're absolutely right, it's available to everyone, I really must stress that. But it would seem that at that particular time, the people that were coming in internationally were from a middle-class background, as a generalization.

What I wanted to say now is, Shri Mataji gave a public program in Kurukshetra on that India tour, and it was evening time. There were a lot of sadhus about, a lot of sannyasis. Sadhus and sannyasis are ascetics who've given up household, regular life, and they've taken to just meditation and seeking. They'd renounced the material world and their families. There were quite a lot of them there, and I could only imagine that there was some particular occasion to be celebrated as to why they were there. But then, of course, Shri Mataji was going to be there. So whether they consciously or unconsciously knew that, I don't know.

It was an evening program in a pandal. It was dusk, and there were a lot of Sahaja Yogis on the tour there from all different countries. Shri Mataji hadn't quite arrived yet. I was inside the pandal, and I looked back at the entrance. There were a couple of sadhus standing to one side, and I could see that they were deliberating on whether they should enter the pandal for Shri Mataji's public program or not. I could see them hesitating.

I went over to them. I said—my Hindi's rubbish—I said, "Come on, come in, come in. You can come in." Because there weren't any sadhus in there. Everyone was nicely turned out Hindus, Indians, and the Western yogis on the tour. And they would have appeared out of place; that's why they were hesitant. I said, "No, no, no, it's free. Come on, come in." So I encouraged them. These were sadhus dressed with their hair up in top knots, ashes on their face, very simple clothing, and an ochre garment. They had their orange cloth, so not in regular clothes.

They came in, a couple of them, two or three of them. Everyone sat down. Shri Mataji came. She talked, she went through the affirmations, and she raised everybody's Kundalini. I don't know how many were there, maybe a thousand people, two thousand, I'm not sure. I can't remember. And at the end of it, she actually cured a lady of blindness. I remember that.

But at the end of the affirmations and raising the Kundalini, you keep your eyes closed and you put your hand up to see if you can feel your Kundalini coming out the top of your head. Then you open your eyes. After the affirmations, when I opened my eyes, I could see these sadhus. They weren't that far away from me. They were sitting bolt upright in the lotus position, completely in meditation. As I opened my eyes and looked at them, and then I looked around at everyone else in the crowd, I saw—it was a vision—that everybody was equal in the eyes of God. It doesn't matter who you were: sadhu, rich, poor, well-to-do, middle class, government servant, businessman, householder. They're all one.

I could see it in my enlightened attention. It was like a little vision. You could feel it from within, the sense of oneness that we were all... what a beautiful feeling. To feel that, because you're feeling part of the humanity that God loves. All of them. And of course, that would be a big thing for the sadhus, because that's what they're looking for. That's what they're seeking.

They just sat there for ages afterwards, like statues in meditation. I didn't disturb them. I just let them be. Everyone else was milling around, and they were just sitting there, bolt upright. Their attention must have been so strong. It was really good.

I'll just recount a couple of dreams, and then I've got a little Sri Hanumana experience on an India tour. From 1993 right up to 2001, I was going to Cabella a lot for the puja season, every summer from late May to August. I got myself various jobs. I was looking quite respectable, quite normal, really. Bought some new clothes. I was living in South London, just going to the center every Saturday night to see the collective and whatnot.

And I had a few dreams. One of them was, I was on some stone steps, quite deep-tread, quite wide steps. And I was sitting on one of the treads. Then Shri Mataji was sitting below me, a couple of steps down. I thought, "Hello, I can't sit higher than her." So I shuffled down to the step below her. Then she shuffled down to the step below me. And then I shuffled down to a couple of steps below her, and she shuffled down to below me. In the end, we ended up lying around on the floor, just cracked up laughing. We were just laughing, laughing, laughing at ourselves. So it was just a bit of humour there to show that the divine is everywhere.

Sometimes we have dreams with Shri Mataji in them, and sometimes you have an "off" dream, and you feel like this actually isn't Shri Mataji. But when it is her in the dream, you really know that it is her, because when you wake up, you feel like Mother's blessed you in your being. This was one of those dreams where Mother was sharing humour with you.

She was very humorous. People don't see that because mostly we watch the public programs or the pujas. In the early pujas, you can see Mother's sense of humour because she could crack a joke or say something or be playful, as was needed in the room at that time. What a sweet thing that she's sharing with you.

When you dream in the deep sleep, in the Sushupti sleep, then very often you'll dream of the divine. That's when you're in the present, in the dream state, in the present. Whereas if you're dreaming about the past or what was going to happen in the future, you're on either side. You're not in the center, in the Sushupti, in the deep sleep.

I just wanted to flip to... I was on the tube. I was teaching English at an English language school on Oxford Street in the mid-90s. The only good thing about it was I was earning money and I had an opportunity to give self-realization in the English classes. But other than that, I hated the job, because I was going into Oxford Street from South London on the bus and the tube. And I'm not a city person, to be honest. I mean, I should be able to cope with any environment, but I don't really do cities particularly well. Must be because of living on the road.

Anyway, so I'm on the tube every morning, on the underground. Of course, it's all very close-hearted. Nobody's talking to each other. Nobody wants to go to work. Commuter misery. And I'm reading a Penguin translation of the Quran because I thought I really ought to get my head around some of the scriptures and the holy books. I was really enjoying it. The Quran is all about the chosen ones and being blessed with eternal life in heaven, in gardens fed by running streams and bathed in glorious light, in God's realm and in God's heaven. The land of milk and honey and being surrounded by celestial virgins and all this. It's all about the rewards if you devote your life to Allah.

So I'm reading it in the mornings. Then one night I got this dream that I'm in this beautiful valley, a Himalayan... it was Kashmir. It was bathed in this golden light. Nearby was this big house, a typical Kashmiri structure with pitched roofs, big stone slate roof coverings, a jetted first floor, rock and cob and timbers. Classic Northwest Indian, Himalayan, Pakistani architecture. Beautiful. Big house, beautiful condition, just a beautiful walled garden with beautifully laid out flower beds, all lovely done in the Islamic way. Manicured trees, beautiful flowing rivers and streams. Lovely.

And then I was living in this bit of a shambles of a place. Similar architecture, but a lot smaller. Very dirty. Not nice. I was living in that in the dream. And what it was, some realized souls—I'd imagine they were yogis—had come to visit. So I took them for a tour around the valley, bathed in golden light. We stepped into this transparent... it was a pushpak basically, into this transparent aerial vehicle. You could step into it, and it was transparent. You could see the stream of eternal life, freshly bubbling water, behind where it was parked because you could see the stream through the structure of the aerial chariot.

We got in it, and I was driving. I mean, I didn't really have to drive, but we got in, my visitors, my guests. And off we shot. We flew around this beautiful... you just wanted it to fly, and it just took off. It just kind of went wherever you wanted it to go, really. And then it gently landed, and we all disembarked. And the dream ended.

What it was, was basically it had all been triggered by reading the Quran about the promised land, the land of milk and honey, Kashmir, and all that. And it translated into this aerial chariot and this beautiful golden light that just surrounded us. I was floating after that dream for quite some days. I felt like I'd actually been there, in the promised land. And of course, Kashmir is the promised land. That's where Moses ended up, although he never got to enter it. He died at the border of it. That's where he was taking the people to, the promised land of Kashmir. Mother Mary was buried there. It is in what's called the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir region. Oh, interesting. But it is there in Murree, in the village of Murree, which is where Mother Mary lived.

It's amazing. As yogis, we can have these extremely vivid, enlightening dreams. It's incredible that your mother is just transporting you there.

This is the 1997 India tour, what could be considered the last India tour with Shri Mataji. And she didn't spend a lot of time with us at the individual locations, but we had Havan and Puja at every location to clear any negativities of those particular places that we visited, working very intensely on the subtle level. What she did, this beauty of India, she'd hired trains. She'd hired a train.

So this time you traveled on trains, not buses. Not rickety, bumpy buses. She'd either hired an entire train or she'd hired a few compartments. I can't remember, but it was just classic India. Anything's possible in India if you've got the right intention. It'll work for you. That's how the divine runs the country.

Actually, having said that, Dr. Nagam did mention hiring trains because of some relative who had that connection.

So it was always international yogis with some Indian yogis, Yuva Shakti, helping us out, looking after us. Such lovely hosts. Basically, we're on this railway station platform, and there was a lot of luggage. Each Western yogi, probably the men were traveling a bit lighter, but the yoginis probably had a couple of big suitcases each. It was a three-week tour around India. You've got to look smart for public programs, with the saris and whatnot. There was a lot of luggage, and they actually had a whole truck just for the suitcases. They might even have had two trucks. And of course, the men helped the Indian yogi men load them up, and at the same time, we were helping to load and unload the train carriages.

Anyway, we were in this station, I don't know where it was, and there was some confusion. We had to change platforms, and we didn't have a lot of time. So, rather than take each case down that platform, over the pedestrian bridge, and onto the other platform opposite, we decided to do a chain across the railway tracks and manhandle the cases from man to man along the chain onto the other platform. A relay of luggage.

That in itself was very ambitious. And of course, the railway track and the ballast between the rails wasn't the cleanest, being a station. It was pretty dirty. Anyway, the men managed to handle the cases onto the opposite platform remarkably, in time. It was like, wow. Then we all got onto that platform and we realised that the cases were going to be in the wrong place. We had to then move the cases up to the other end of the platform. And we never thought of this. I'm thinking, "Blimey, the clock's ticking here. That train's coming in in a minute."

There's no way we were going to get that pile of cases. It was a big pile of suitcases, got to be 30, 40 cases, big ones, heavy. How are the men going to walk all them cases up to the other end of that platform? I just didn't know how we were going to do it. In those days, we didn't really have wheels on the cases. We tried to engage some porters with barrows, but you get into the haggling and all that. So the men decided to take two cases each and walk them up the other end of the platform, which was busy anyway with Indian citizens.

We were really struggling. We'd drop the cases off and go back to pick up some more. And as this was going on, I'm thinking, "We ain't going to do this." As I dumped my cases off and was going back for more, with more men coming up along the platform, weaving in and out of the Indians, I'm thinking, "We're not going to get this done."

And as I was thinking that, I was aware of this whooshing above my head, above us, this whooshing sound in the air, in the ether. I was aware of it. Towards the end of this task, I got to the end where the pile of suitcases was, and there was nothing there. All them cases that were still left... he'd taken them up, above our heads, because you couldn't see him, but I could feel him whooshing along.

Then I walked back because the pile wasn't there anymore. I walked back to where the new pile was. I looked at it. I just went, "That's not possible. There's no way those men could have done that." And it was him, in that manner above us. And that's when I first met, well, on that tour, I met Baba Mama. I'd seen him before hosting pujas, but there was one station and Baba Mama was just behind me. He was talking to some other yogis and I was just minding my own business. I heard his voice, and as I heard his voice, I just felt elevated. I felt this big rush of vibrations. I mean, I didn't take off or anything, but I went whoosh, a big whoosh. And I looked behind and it was him. Later on in the tour, I did have a few words with him. It was some lovely magic. It was real magic on those tours.

I always felt that when I came into Sahaja Yoga, that after you get your realisation, there are things you couldn't have imagined you could feel. Especially in India, I felt that you touch these depths... I just can't put it into words, but you touch the world of the spirit, beyond words. And I realised that the world of the spirit is vast. It's like we're in this small plane, pushed down by our agyas and our thoughts, and then you go beyond that and there's this whole different world that gives you these really deep experiences, where anything is possible because you're in the realm of the spirit. That's a lovely story to share. Thank you.

Well, I'm waiting for the one about your wife.

Okay. So here we go into the next one. A very quick one now, because I can't go into the detail. It's not appropriate. I'm getting close to the year 2000. I'm in my back garden in South London, and I'm digging over my potato patch. It's a nice sunny afternoon. And I'm on my own in the house. I'm digging the potatoes over, I get up, stretch my back. It drops into my head that I'm going to marry an Indian woman. And I'm thinking, "What's this? I'm already married." I was married for seven years then. I thought, "I'm already married. Why am I going to marry an Indian woman?"

Anyway, very shortly, the marriage broke down. I won't go into the details, but the marriage broke down. I left that house in South London and went to stay with some Sahaja Yogis in Norbury. It was a collective house there. I'd rented a little box room. I'd got my car, filled it up with my carpentry tools, I'd got my two dogs, and I was staying there. It was when the two towers got hit by Osama bin Laden. 2001. September 11th, 2001.

Yes, I was staying there with some young yogis, some lovely people. And I had a dream. I had a dream that I was sitting down on this red, arid, rocky ground in India. I was in white kurta pajamas, no holes. There were a couple of other European yogis with me in similar attire, and we were sitting down cross-legged on the ground chatting. When I woke up, I knew where I was. I was in Ganapatipule at the back of the beach, for the Sahaja Yoga International Seminar. I wasn't on that India tour, but I went anyway to Ganapatipule.

So I had this dream. I was sitting down, and there was a lovely blue sky. There were three of us sitting down, three men. Then out of the blue, out of the blueness, appeared this beautiful young woman wearing a blue sari with a gold border. She had this beautiful smile, and this light was just radiating from her. She appeared by magic. She came out of the blue with her hands like this, a beautiful smile. As she got closer to me, she bent over and offered me this silver plate with beautiful food.

Sitting down with the lads. As she does this, I do Namaskar to her feet. And as I'm coming up from Namaskar, which is bowing down, she then recedes. This beautiful smile, this beautiful sort of waving hand gesture and poof, disappears. I wake up in the morning, thinking, "Who the hell was that?" I'm thinking it can't be a deity. She hadn't got enough pairs of hands. She wasn't dressed like a deity. She was radiating beautiful light, but she didn't have the ornamentation of a deity. I thought, "Oh, she must be some kind of celestial being or something." I was quite taken aback by that whole thing. And that was the end of that.

I knew where I was when I woke up. I knew I was in Ganapatipule because I recognised the red rock. I'd been to Ganapatipule before in 1993. Lo and behold, because my previous marriage had ended quite suddenly, and although I hadn't been divorced, I was a free man. We'd separated.

There's another little story behind this. On my first marriage, I was staying at Chelsea Road whilst working at Ealing, and Chris was there. He was very wise because I had this real desire to get married. He said, "Shankar, you be careful what you desire. You don't want to get married. Believe me, you don't want to get married. Best thing is to be desireless. Go beyond, be detached." But I totally ignored him. I was a young man, all fired up. I wanted to get married. I wanted to get into family life. I didn't want to live on my own in a horse box anymore.

That was in 1993. And of course, that led to my first marriage, which didn't work out. What I should have done, in hindsight, was listen to what Chris was telling me.

So that first marriage broke down. I was staying in Norbury on the rebound. I had the dream. I knew it was Ganapatipule. I was a driven man. I thought, "Right, that's it. I'm going to Ganapatipule. I'm going to put my name down on the marriage list." The breakup happened in autumn. By December, I was on the plane. I'd scrambled some money together from somewhere. I was like a one-track mind. It was like Mother's calling you. She's saying, "Okay, come on. Get yourself sorted out." It was almost as if she said, "Oh, don't worry. I'll sort you out with a nice girl." Not that my first marriage wasn't nice, but it broke down.

So I'm there in the men's dorm, and we're all sprucing ourselves up for the announcements as to who's going to marry who. It's all at Shri Mataji's discretion, her vibratory and enlightened attention. She knows us all, all our past lives, all our horoscopes, how high we've come. She knows everything, and you've got to have that faith.

So I'm getting spruced up. I heard they're saying, "Everyone come to the pandal at Ganapatipule. It's going to be the marriage announcement." So I'm thinking, "No, I'll just stay back in the men's dorm. I'll get myself prepared, take my Shri Ganesha mantra, get detached. Then I'll go." I turned up just as they were starting to announce. I don't usually sit up the front, but this time, I don't know what it was, I had to gravitate towards the front of the stage. Within about three minutes of me sitting down, they announced our names.

Sushmita Singh from Delhi, she goes up. Shankar from UK, he goes up. We come up from either side of the stage. Shri Mataji is not there, but the Indian Sahaja Yogis... we did namaskar to her throne. Then you've got the organisers doing the announcements. We did namaskar. It's got lovely vibrations. As we walk off together to the side of the stage, one of the organisers beckons us over and says, "Shankar, Mother said you can't get married until your divorce comes through." So I clocked it. Then we went off together as a couple, sat in the audience, and then the rest of the announcements happened. There was a lovely music program and all that.

A couple of days went on. The question in all our minds is, did you recognise Sushmita from your dream? Not at the time. This is interesting.

So we're sitting there listening to the music, and then Sushmita turns to me and says, "Shall we go for a walk?" I'm thinking, "Bloody hell. Already, go for a walk together? I don't think we should do that, should we?" But of course, we were matched; the divine had matched us. It was like an engagement. Shri Mataji always gave you a bit of time to decide whether you wanted to go ahead with it. So we went off, went down to have a cup of tea at the entrance of the Ganapatipule camp, and chat and have an omelette and all that to get to know each other.

I wanted to say that how the matches were announced... we were going just by vibrations. Because in India, divorce, even at that time, was really rare and looked down upon. So for your father to let you marry a divorced man...

Yeah, and both my parents were with me at Ganapatipule. So this was a very, very special, very significant trip. None of us were actually expecting any outcome so far as marriage is concerned, least of all.

Even though your name was down?

Yes, you weren't expecting a match because there were many, many young Indian women, much more than could be matched. It was pretty far out and very special that my father and mother were with me. My brother couldn't come because of work, but we all used to attend pujas of Shri Mataji at Nirmal Dham together. So yes, to give that background as well, because in India, it was a big no-no at that time, but because it was Shri Mataji who had matched us, the vibrations meant everything. The next step to cross was that I wouldn't have married him if he didn't get the approval of my parents. As an Indian girl, it's just something that has to happen.

So we had a cup of tea, an omelette, a chat. I think that night we were out till about midnight. Working in Delhi with news magazines, I had a modern head on me. I wasn't the typical traditional Indian woman. I thought I was very with it and I wanted to know if I wanted to spend the rest of my life with this person who I had no clue about, apart from the vibrations.

And I was looking quite tidy. I had smartened myself up.

Anyway, it was pretty much midnight. I had to get her back to her guest house down in the village. Luckily, we got an auto-rickshaw. I went back to the camp, and then over a couple of days, we went to the Swayambhu. Like all the couples, you go and make your offerings to Shri Ganesh. There's a Shri Ganesh Mandir on the back of the beach where the divine manifests in the Mother Earth. You can go there and see Shri Ganesh's head. It's probably about two meters by a meter and a half in a rocky relief. You can clearly see his head, his ears, his trunk. And of course, the Indians cover the Swayambhu in an orangey-red paint of respect and offer flowers and incense. The Swayambhu is giving off vibrations, and even if an Indian is not realized, they still know that that's a very auspicious place.

So we did that, the typical sort of engaged couple thing. And evening comes. It's time for my interview with my prospective father-in-law. It's half-light. There's the artificial lighting of the camp and thousands of yogis there. I'm on the main drag from the entrance of the camp up to the Pandal, and there's a whole throng of yogis going backwards and forwards. A yogini gets hold of me and says, "Oh, Shankar, Sushmita is waiting for you up there on the rise, off to the side on the hill with her dad." She recognized me in the throng, picked me out, said, "You better get up there."

I'm going, "Right. Okay." So I'm smoothing my hair down. I go up the slightly rocky path. It's a bit dark, but you've got artificial lights coming from the main drag. I approach Sushmita and her dad, and they're sitting down on the ground in the half-light. Sushmita is sitting furthest from me, beside her dad. I knew from being to India before that you shouldn't look at a father's daughter directly. You've got to avert your eyes a bit, keep them down. So I just focused on my future father-in-law, Dr. Singh, from North India, from Ayodhya, and didn't look at his daughter.

I sat down next to him. And the interview starts. So he asked about my education. I passed that one with my geography degree. I didn't tell him what grade I got, which wasn't very good. Then he's saying, "What's your profession?" And I said, "Carpenter." There was a moment's pause. Of course, if you're a carpenter in India, you're earning peanuts and maybe not so well respected. So I said, "Carpenter." Then he said, "What's your income?" I quickly threw in "16 grand a year," and I bumped it up a bit to give a good impression because I wasn't earning that. He took that, I ticked that box.

Then there was an awkward pause. My eyes went to Sushmita's feet. She's sitting with her knees tucked up, her arms around her knees, and her toes were pointing out from her sari. I looked at her toes and then I noticed the sari she was wearing was a blue sari with the gold border. And then I looked up at her face, and I remembered the dream, and it was her. Sushmita means "the one with the beautiful smile." In the dream, she had a beautiful smile. It was a spiritual form. She was radiating love and golden light.

I remembered the dream in a flash. And I told my future father-in-law the dream. He said, "Okay, you can marry. No problem." That was it.

Oh, beautiful. See how Mother sets you up. Because she knows if there's going to be difficulties or problems, and when it's meant to be, she just knocks down all the barriers like that. And you remembered it at the right time. That was the moment to remember it.

That's the divine for you.

We got married in 2002, so it'll be 20 years. After his divorce papers had come through, we got married the next year. We had an engagement in Cabella. We had a nine-month engagement, which was nice because it gave us time... phones had just come in. We would message from his Nokia. And in my meetings, because I was still working with India Today then, I'd be quickly, surreptitiously looking at the text messages.

So 23 years, or nearly 23 years. Two children and family life. From how I was when I was seeking as a young man in Devon, when I was going to top myself, to what God's done for me... I just wanted to convey to any viewers, yogis, non-yogis, realized souls in the future, 10, 15, 20, a hundred years in the future, and to my friends from Plymouth Poly and to my family who bear with me—they've got a lot of patience, my family. I'm so glad for this opportunity to tell the truth because I don't think I'm going to get it together to write a book. I'm so glad for modern technology and Zoom, for the collective, and eternally for humanity and God Almighty.

If we don't do this, we're not doing the divine any justice. We're not doing our own birth any justice if we don't share. And it's not easy. It's very difficult to convey that to non-realized people. Like Mother did with us, it's about just giving them their self-realization, and they ease themselves into it. They evolve into it. That's the way to do it. All of these lovely online programs and public programs Sahaja Yogis are giving across the world, they're just passing it on. Hopefully one day we'll all be living in a lovely, beautiful, peaceful world with beautiful divine vibrations, how the divine wants it to be.

One thing that I took very recently from a talk... because like all of us, we get a bit worried about world affairs. And there's a talk I heard where Mother said, "Do you really think God Almighty is going to stand by and let human beings destroy His creation?" I thought, "There you go." He's stepping in, you know, and has stepped in.

So lovely. Thank you so much, Shankarji. And it's been such a pleasure to talk to you both and to actually be a part of a story that is all thanks to Shri Mataji, really, for making it happen. And this beautiful world that she has created for all of us. Jai Shri Mataji. Thank you.
