I am very happy that you have come and I would request Mataji to [serve] you.

Shri Mataji: Now you ask Me questions..

Questions: Can we feel these experiences? There are words that I would like to learn. And I am very happy that you have come and I would request Mataji..

Shri Mataji: What? Yes, yes. You should. You should be. Why not? Especially you. You want to feel it first before asking questions? That's the best. I mean if you are a seeker you should ask for that.  What's the use of asking questions? I am not a political leader, not seeking votes. Best thing is that. Yes why not, and especially you. Firstly because you are Indian and you come from Kerala where Ravi Shankarachaia was born.  Why was he born great powers. You can. Why not? Just put your hands towards Me you can. If you want to ask Me questions. You can ask. You see it’s a question of what you want. Not only that you can feel it but you can see with your naked eyes the rising of the kundalini. You can see the pulsation on the triangular bone. You can see the pulsation on the triangular bone. You can see  rising very clearly. Absolutely with the stethoscope. Now we have Doctor Borgi with us luckily, he’s here. You can see it rise.

Question. I receive it first?

Shri Mataji: Yes, that’s the best. All right. You ask the questions first of all that’s the way you like, then you move forward It’s a question of just a split of a second the kundalini rises. But there is a little part of the kundalini  sometimes is blocked by your physical, mental, emotional disturbances which are these different chakras which we have to nourish a little bit.

I can. Thousands of them will get it, in the villages especially. That’s why I say I am more interested in the villages that in this five star hotel. It’s very easy to give realisation to in the villages. [with most of them.] It’s a very difficult task to work in London but in an Indian village, just like this how? Just like that. You become. Definitely this is a yoga. You have to be become. But we have to know what our catches are. We have to know how to meditate. You have to know all the negativity.

Question At what stage...

Myself I ask you see if you ask Me this question I’ll have to ask you one question so that will explain. If I ask what state did you realise you are a human being? You won’t be able to say.

Question Pardon?

No training is needed for Me. You see you are a human being. It is inbuilt. It’s all inbuilt you see. So supposing you are a human being, so your capacity as a human being is inbuilt within you is it? You don’t have to be told that you are a human being.  In the same way it has happened.

Question: Unclear.

Shri Mataji: Yes you are quite aware. Then you can see what will make it happen. You know you are a human being in the same way you know you are this.

You know it like a child first of all. Still you know gradually. A dog knows he’s a dog. A human child knows he’s a human child, that he’s not a dog.

Question: What is the difference of between philosophy and the philosophy of mind?

Shri Mataji: Oh tremendous, absolutely tremendous. Now I would say one thing more again you see because I’m your Mother and you must guard My estate about it because you see the government has sponsored this and all this and all this is the first time I have yielded to a thing like that. So, I don’t want to fall into a controversy but it’s just the opposite of Mine. I get it. Absolutely just the opposite. You just think of something like you give somebody a name. I mean why do you need a guru to give a name? When you give a name there’s a big chakra. If you come to Sahaja Yoga you will know what different deities are on different chakras. Then which chakra is wrong with you. Accordingly, you have to be told that name of that deity at that particular centre. Then the Kundalini moves from that centre to another centre. So you have to be told that. There is no talk of kundalini or chakras or anything. You just give somebody a name you see. It is like saying that uh take this toothbrush and brush your teeth and you’ll have a leg. Before and after sort of, it’s all an advertising thing. Moreover, it’s much deeper. I’ve seen people who go to transcendental meditation are very difficult to get realisation, very difficult. We have got here three people from transcendental meditation. They had tremendous headaches. They suffered a lot. When they came to see Me they were just rattling like this.

Now you might say that I may be wrong too. You see I may be wrong but now how do you determine this way? That if you bring a mad person, a lunatic person he also a trembles before Me. If you bring a possessed person he also trembles before Me. In the same way they tremble before Me and rather difficult to give self realisation. They take time.

Question:[unclear]

I do not take, I’m sorry. I do, they do. You see. These people are not Me. That is a different thing. This is the way it always the human mind is from the other side and the mine is from the other side.  Why should I claim? Does the son claim that I’m [unclear:Christ ]?  Why should I claim? If you are a rakshesa do you claim that you are a human being to anyone? Why should you. Do you claim that you are a human being to anyone? You see this Omkara it is a divine. Now first of all do you believe in God? To begin with. Do you?

Questioner: Yes.

Shri Mataji:  All right if you believe in God? God has to take you say from amoeba stage to human. How does He do it? How does He guide you? He has to have some way of guiding you. So one of these aspects which is known as the Vishnu aspect you can say the evolutionary aspect, takes different forms at different stages, comes on this earth and tries transform to that. Like a fish wanting to come out of this. So a fish of that. Like that all the Omkaras are nothing but guiding leaders which came from divine. There is another psychological way that they describe as Jung has said. Jung who was a disciple of God, he said through our unconscious in our dreams they got the divine power guides us, the all-pervading power guides. But dreams when the time we are awakened out of dreams we forget most of it so the guidance is not perfect. After all somebody has to tell you about the divine. I have to tell you where are your chakras. I have to tell you how you catch them. I have to tell you what are these fingers for. You will see all that we have done very elaborate. And these fingers what these chakras are. Actually I studied your medicine just to talk to doctors. I studied also a little bit of psychology to talk to the psychologists because God does not have language.

Question: Your disciples claim that you are the second coming of Christ?

Shri Mataji: No. I am not Christ. Christ has to come. But when He will come He will not spare anyone. That's what it is. I am just preparing for that time because I am a Mother. He will chastise [unclear] He will come but He is not going to come to give you realisation and to convince you of righteousness or anything no. He is coming for the last sorting out, what we do [unclear:] He is going to come for the last judgement in a very short time so we have to be careful.

Question: Unclear

You see what I do is to, what we do is to – I will tell you something about medical science which is, you know, is quite boring but if you don't mind I will explain to you what's happened. Because you see if you ask Me to put on the [unclear: television] you need press a button. But what did I do, and how it works out? What was the electrical thing, unclear what was the history behind it? Of course there is an organisation so if you want I can explain to you what I did. Actually I don't do anything. It just happens that you have got already built in you the mechanism, the complete mechanism. You can see open the pages and see there is a picture of a human being sitting with a mechanism. [unclear:]

You can see here, see here this one is the picture. This is the subtle energy a subtle instrument within us. This is.  Now of course I mean you can't see here with your naked eyes because this is an energy form. But if it is there or not for that you have to come to Sahaja Yoga and see with your own eyes that this residual energy here, this triangular bone residual energy rises like this and opens out. This is the baptism of what Jesus Christ has told you. He said you have to have to be baptised, but not by the people who [unclear] You cannot regulate it. You have to have it. You have to become a saint.  That means this must open out. Unless and until you are enlightened like a light which is enlightened like a candle. You can enlighten another candle. Now you have to be a candle to begin with and that is the candle you are. You are already made like this. You are an instrument which is already prepared like this. You can say like this tape recorder. You are made like a computer, and you are just to be put to the mains and  the whole thing starts working. It's a fine area.

Now what I do to medically I have explained in My article here which is [university medical people] and this is My first [unclear] Now this one is here. Now what you can understand is that God has made you from amoeba to a human, all right? Now after human being stage what does He does He want you to do? Why did He make you a human ? Why did He make? Have you got your fulfilment? Supposing I make some mushrooms, then you will ask, “Mother why are you making these mushrooms? That instrument must have it's fulfilment or not. So to make mushrooms is fulfilment or not. So you already made like this. It is already made. It is all prepared. I don't have to do anything. Just what I do is explain the kundalini to you because it is a consciousness which knows Me. It just acts automatically.

Question: How do you do it?

Shri Mataji: You see because it is a consciousness which knows. It just acts. How do you make a  fish pie to a bake? What do you do? It has a hunger.

Question:[unclear]

Shri Mataji:  No. It is a residual consciousness. Consciousness has many, many aspects. See we have – in different ways we have consciousness. First of all we have the conscious mind in which you are listening to Me.  All right. You are listening to Me. Now. All experiences and everything that you are listening to Me is going into your past. So we can say that is the sub-conscious.  Then there is a conscious mind because it thinks about the future.  That's the pre conscious mind. Now I am talking about the super conscious mind where you become one with the all-pervading power. So you become collectively conscious. You become that. Now they can see your kundalini. They can   see your chakras. They can see what's wrong.  They are just like you to look at, nothing, no difference. But inside they know and you will also know because it is an actualisation not just up in the brain here, or just a sermon or sitting down reading a program. It is not. It is a happening that happens within you and when it happens you become [ unclear] into a collective consciousness. It happens. You just become that. For example see human beings, they are better than an animal. How?  How do you know a human consciousness is better? For example you take a dog through dirt, filth. It won't mind but human beings will mind. A human being understands the beauty,  the  combination of colours. A dog does not.

This is a different dimension that you have to reach. All of us have to reach. This is the evolutionary jump now where you become conscious of that all-pervading power. [unclear. About which should be here] It is so dynamic you can't imagine. Sitting down here you can feel somebody's vibrations. You can cure a person. It is already built in, you see. Like I come outside and I can push the button the whole mechanism starts working because it's all built in you see. It started from amoeba state or even strongly you can say from the primal state, even earlier when it was just a power which got into many forms and now we have to express it through you. You won't – another level of consciousness is where you become collectively conscious and I must tell you as I was telling Mr Maharaja the other day that first you know yourself. You know God. Without knowing yourself you cannot know God. Like without eyes you cannot see the colours. You cannot know God without being self realised.  If you go to a temple what do you do you do? You just do the mechanical thing.  You have to become that.

Whatever you may do in the name of God, God does not know you because you are not connected. It's Like telephoning to somebody who is not there. Why? You yourself is connected  with God. Then your own property becomes alive again. Now you are the capitalist when you get your self realisation. Then you have to be civil. If you do not be civil you are not happy so you become a real communist. There's no point. Let it go.  You can't sleep. Like the sun you get. The sun is the greatest communist you can say but if it didn't you did not have light. [How can,] And then you do not want any divorce. Nothing. It just emits.  I am talking about that awareness which we have not yet gone into. Shankaracharia has talked about it. Who has bothered about it?  You see our great politicians cannot see this at all. But what I find is they are all Englishmen. They are more English than the English are I can tell you. What we have to project is what we have. So our politicians cannot see that this is the esteem we have got in our country, our spiritual heritage. Let us put this and nourish it. We will lead the whole world one day. We are very clever you have no idea. I mean you have no idea [unclear: what it is] And we are not happy.  You have to learn from them.

They have finished their family life. They have finished their society. They are very unhappy people. [actual number of] And for your information in England every week two children are killed by parents. These are children are killed by their parents, mother or father. Can you think of such a thing? Terrible.  Absolutely animals. Where are we developing ourselves? [unclear] They are extremely unhappy people and we have got such a great gift and I have got it here. You see now in America [because the doctors there [unclear: This is your ] Your heritage. [Unclear ]You should have. I have to teach about Ganesha who is sitting down here.  He knows about Christ, because he is the Christ.

But what about others? Ganesha is the same as Christ is. He’s the same incarnation. It is Christ who is nothing less than Mahvishnu. I can prove it on the kundalini. You can ask any absolute question once you are realised. You get the vibrations and you will know that it is certain. It is an inheritance.Why not short circuit and bring them around also?   refuse to go there because the doctors there will immediately pick it up, You see. This is your thing. Your heritage.  But you see I cannot have. I mean to say that you can’t have cheap popularity. You see if I have a [unclear] you will come here. And how can you charge money for such a thing? It’s incentive isn’t it?  18.27 Even to think like that. You cannot purchase God. And it’s nice. I don’t have to have ashram now. I can always get people to call. You see if you are building an ashram it is a headache. Everything is a headache. They wanted to have ashram in London. I said I will agree to ashram. You collect but I don’t need any money from them. And how can I take money from my children. But I said if you want to have ashram for this just do it, but on one condition it that no black market money is doing off and 70 years they have tried. They cannot have for such wretched sinful people, why should there be ashram? Just not one person has offered us that Mataji  have this place. But they don’t mind giving money to this Mahesh yogi.  This yogi that yogi. All those people they have got loads of them. Now this Rajneesh this is another fellow you must have  I don’t  know if I should mention it under your saint,[estate]  but do you know what sort of a man he is? 

Question:  Can I tell you something about your education? Where you were born?

Shri Mataji: My education? I never had medical education as such but I did medicine. You see once I never needed an education as said, but I did medicine because I wanted to talk to doctors. I also studied under a psychiatry. [unclear]  and she’s also a very well-known doctor and then she’s also was a professor of medicine.  And the lady you have now they are saying, the one whom they know about so much. In London you see her husband was my professor. And he could not believe that this is so. They cannot, the scientists cannot  believe that this is all pervading power. What can scientists do? You see? See  I don’t  blame them because if they see this is red they say this is red. But supposing you have eyes like microscope to which you can see more than this. Then you can prove it to them. So I said, you take your realisation and then you can see this. But they don’t want to take it. Now I cured this no doubt I’ve cured 100%. I’ve cured so many cancer patients, my disciples and cancer cannot be cured by anything else but Sahaja Yoga.  Take it from Me. It was born with Me.

So my background is that my father was a congressman, a very fellow congressman and he also came to Kerala wants to do a lot of canvassing for elections. He was a great speaker and also he was a member of the old central assembly. There were only two from Madar Pradesh and then he was the member of the constituent assembly, then of the parliament. And like that I have a background. I myself, I have been tortured by Britishers and they have really tortured my life because in 1942  I took a very active part and consequently we had to be free it was important before getting free how we tested, but as soon as you got freedom you forgot that you are Indian. You see I have no bitterness about it. You will be amazed  the British today, the younger British, the younger people are very different from their fathers. They are such excellent people that in the foreigners, I would say they are the best. Because they do not have a shifty nature of the Americans. Americans are doing only guru shopping.

You see they’re very solid people. They don’t take to Sahaja Yoga easily. They see first and then they come. You see they are the most blessed people. I don’t know maybe they have got blessings of this country or whatever it is, but they’re the most blessed people. They are the most balanced amongst all of them put together. And that’s how My husband got elected. And that’s how I am here.

So what more background do you want to know? I have got two daughters and four grandchildren. And you know about my husband. Now what more? Now who could be in my room and will tell everyone of you needs to be very frank because through you I have to understand about people. I really don’t understand you and all of these people. So I should say you are My [ unclear: it's amazing] That’s to be.

Question: How old you are? How young?

Shri Mataji: I’m very old. I’m 40. I’m 56. I’m 57 now. Yes. In terms of what.  What? Well quite old. Age has to be accepted. You see. Even God has to be a normal person to talk. I have to become old I have to be just. I have to be just like you. I'm not here to show miracles. You have to be absolutely a normal person. Absolutely a saman just like you. So that you’ll accept Me much more easily.

Question: Unclear [withdraw from worldly life]

Shri Mataji: Not at all. It is just a show. What are you doing? You see you are wearing those dresses just to show that advertising like Amazon. It's just a happening within yourself. It's a happening within yourself. Nothing. On the contrary I bless all the families. Family is the most important. As you know there are some very great souls who want to be born in this country. Now. Why do we have over-population? Have you ever thought of it? We used to pray for fortune. Remember that a few years ago and why people are trying to be born here?

In England there is a recession. In Germany there is a recession. People are given money as an incentive to have children. Why children are not wanted. In Sweden they are borrowing children from India and they are also going to Colombia and  taking children with them or orphan children and all.  Why are children not born there? Why do they  not want them? Why? Because which sensible man will be born in  those horrible conditions. There is no sensible man. You have to bear the load. That's why we have to bear the load.  Don't you be afraid of your bodies.

Question

Yes they are, no doubt, you are correct there but I have seen people still people don't open their hearts eyes. They do not understand because. They do not have the wisdom to see you see because they have a glow around them and they go with a big pomp and show and this and that.  So people are so superficial. They accept it.  Like I was telling about Rane in London only nine people started their show an it's very funny way they started. Basically they had no money so they took out all their clothes, started dancing and shouting.  Some people came round to see them. Now they have thousands. They don't know what to buy. They will buy the whole of London one day. But one simple thing in this respect is this license to. [unclear] Why do we need a guru?  I mean they can teach all of these gurus.

There's no rising of the kundalini or anything. It's all happened it's not vibrations it's pulsation by becoming naked. If people can become realised then I think in Kerala, half of the people will.  You see It's all absurd. You see you are intelligent people with a heritage and  its a silly thing absolutely silly.  [unclear:and he s a car is to insult the baby to insult the laws of chastity . See he is the one who has taught people to be absolutely perverted. We are all  shocked by the kind of people living that way. You have no idea. These people cannot even tell you. I mean you are too innocent to know what sort of people they are. If you don't see it in the paper [unclear: its too much shocking.] [because we think they are very happy]

There's a law in England and all over the western world that a man cannot sleep with his mother, and the daughter cannot sleep with the father. There's a law. Sleep doesnt mean the way we sleep with our mothers. We dont have dont do dirty things. They cannot. But they have a law. Now they are wanting to break that law  and there's a big procession at the parliament I have seen with my own eyes on the BBC television. They are demanding that this law should be broken and they should be allowed to enjoy. Now can you think of anything? With all their advancements. They are silly people, idiots you see, idiots. You see with ego one becomes [unclear: an idiot] they are shown how. So even [ Ramayan. In the Ramayan they are shown how ] but they are all idiots, absolutely idiotic. So even [unclear] can become and idiot. But they are all idiots. Absolutely idiotic. You don't know how to talk to them. Absolute idiots. What have they got?  They haven't got even one cotton roti that you have got. They have only plastic and nylon. Why do we need nylon for this nice planet of ours? God has given us such a beautiful planet.Why do we need so many clothes? We can live in a hut. But they are coming here and living in hut and we have just [unclear]

Now more questions.

You must ask because you see I don't – because intelligence is such you see it always ties us back but this is beyond intelligence. It's a happening. Supposing a seed is to be sprouted, what intelligence are you going to put there?  It's a living process. You cannot do it by thinking. But here especially. But here the people are very well educated in English not in Indian. It's a fact. Look Nirvana. Jessie. Not only he but all his – he is an Englishman. Now we have Phillippa here. She's a  great writer you know. They have sorted it out. Once they found the truth they have sorted it out. All Markendeya, all of them.Shankaracharia [everything nobody in our country is] 

[unclear] How can people respect them? They don't know anything about their own motherhood.  So it is Sahaja Yoga in [part ] only the, you can say the evolutionary process, but by evolution you reach the reality.  And it's evolution complete evolution.

That's why evolution is the reality. It's also a dharmic evolution. That's why for example in the temple – not so much here in the north. What are these pundits doing? Horrible people are rakeshesas. Sitting down and taking money from this person, that person. They want for nothing. They're forcing people. You must have heard about these cults which the people who are singing,  Walking for miles together for one month they walk and go to that temple. And there are these pundits they really shave the heads of people just like a coconut. Actually I tell you, I hear they are using money and they live such a horrid life. In the name of God actually they are mammals They are not human beings. So it's an evolution against them also, to prove what are the mantras, to prove what are the deities, what is the reality. We have to get rid of all these nonsensical things which are sitting on our body and honour just  honour our spirit, and honour our being completely [unclear] who was a brahmin and was a realised soul. Rachman Brahmin was not born and so many. And somebody told Me that in the gita  I think who was he one who has written Gita. He wrote Gita at least.

He was the son of a fisherman. That is amazing. How you write that you can be born as a brahmin, you cannot.  He was the son of a fisher. That is too legitimate. How could you write that you can be born as a grey? You cannot. What we talked of the past was this the aptitude that you are a Brahman by aptitude. That means you are seeking God in the Brahma. But the ones who are, Who are supposed to be chattis are the people who are seeking power for joy. But joy you can only get through this all pervading, through your own being., through your own spirit which is the beginning. Which has to come into play. But when it comes into play these vibrations start flowing which we call a state. They start flowing from like Christ has said. Somebody touched his robe and he said my energy has passed.

What do they know these Christians. What do they know of Christ. Imagine this pope wearing all these big diamonds on top of his body. How many diamonds did Christ have? And in Colombia I  went down and I went to Chile and Argentina. And foolishly they said, if Christ was not born a poor man then he would have been more effective.  How to talk. See if Christ was. He is a rama. Those who hanker after kings. How can they be kings? The king is satisfied so couple you make me sleep. I sleep if you make me sleep there I sleep. Such a person doesn’t need it. How much do you need really?

You see whatever you want to do out of me I’m here and I will see you. And I have told Mr Rajan that I would love to meet the villagers. And I’m here for them. But here I come. It’s a good thing in a way. I must praise your minister very much I met him for the first time but I liked him for one thing. He’s such a rare person. I mean to think that he said that this is the heritage of our family. This is the heritage of the mother. Daruha any languages. This is the heritage of  the Mother. We should project this instead of casinos.  See they they have casinos, they have ballroom dancing much better than you have. Actually nobody comes to India with that idea.  They come here for peace, for peace about which they know of. When they come here and you give them cheap jazz and this and that . They do not want it. You ask all of them. They come here for peace and for relaxation. And he said  that we should project this instead of projecting their sort of nonsense. That’s why perhaps I am coming in India because English can teach us surgeon. We wont learn directly from it. Is it so that we have to learn from English?  If you want to have some experience on anything you can stay on. I would like to see and moreover one more point I would like to see because George has there and there is a village here where people are suffering from the state. [break in sound]

Question:There’s all these things which we have to neutralise it. How do you leave those things?

You have to neutralise it.  You neutralise, otherwise people you are not going to give up one thing to accept another. It's not tangible.

But this is our Sahaja Yoga is so tangible.

Shri Mataji: Yes I know you walk one No,no, no not at all. Then you go from one extreme to another extreme. You see you don’t become politically quiet but you're free within yourself.  Then you do not jump from one to another. 

Question: But then how can you win? I mean people are not going to leave those.

Shri Mataji:  They will. They will. You see it's light we are born into light. They will.

We have to have, we have to have. Who said that. We will get them. There are so.  For example cancer. You cannot cure cancer except through sahaj. You must get your self realization. So if you want to help the people let them come down.

We have a doctor here who is practising Sahaja Yoga and has now cured a doctor's wife of cancer. So freely we have to accept this.  I mean we have so many other ways we can make them understand. The day will come.

Question: Do you have a  class in London because   Like everybody else... now one lady in Teheran.They are all in a bad state. 

Basically they will they things  we can neutralize. We have the power to neutralize them. They will. You see the winning is. You don’t need it You don’t need

Shri Mataji:  So we'll send it over to you. We have given in detail, all the things about this. How the mechanism within you, the subtle mechanism.  How you get connected with the mains you see. How you are made and we've tried to do it in short. I mean in quite a concise way we have given quite good information about it and please have a look at it. What I  think that I would like to meet the people of England who are actually sort of thinking they are in charge. I would like to talk to them about it because these young people, you see, they have no sense.

Q: This is a problem I think because your, your end up going into politics.   Theres  no way  anybody in the western type can do anything without having some [unclear: to do it.] have. Prisoners of the material way of life. English are concerned about their football, television programs. Life is too full. Slowly get things closed down.

Shri Mataji: I would say that your young people are very responsive. You see to get into politics. It's a good idea. I have My attention on that. But I will still say that they have to be something of a higher personality, impress on others. If they have to be defined unlike others. I worked only on six people. They were all hippies and taking drugs, but now they are  [unclear: people] They have given up drugs, they are beautiful and they have had all kinds of experiences. So it is going to work out. But primarily if you ..that some people would be willing to do something because you have to think they will be leaders tomorrow.

Q

You see the trouble is....  yoga today.. all kind of faiths   even what you call the pope, this nonsense and it's horrible. I don't know why they have  to make such a fuss of these horrible people. They are ruining your young people. They have fleeced them completely, made money out of them. Why can't they see. [unclear] From India one has born who wants to be filmed and. She said why are you filming me you have got Mataji the one who has given you all the power to do this? and they said, “No” [unclear] You see its very difficult knowing how to push forward. We have a neighbour who is an MP [unclear]

I have to neutralise. Just give some ideas to these boys how to neutralise their life. I think they will work it out I am sure.

Q. Even somebody like me who may be reaching a point where I will need something very soon. How will anybody get my attention, It's impossible. Very soon I will go back to England. I will be a embracing football and everything else.

Shri Mataji: [unclear] Teheran is westernised,
