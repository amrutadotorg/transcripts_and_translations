[Shri Mataji after Her arrival holds a statue of Shri Ganesha: “May God bless you. For the Portuguese. All right?”.]

So today is a day of celebrating a very different type of thing, is the House of your Mother, which is called as the Mooladhara itself, no doubt. And it’s the Gauri, you see, who has to enter and stay there till you get your Realisation.

To come to England itself was really very well chased up and exciting, because this is the heart, where I had to come and work it out. And at this stage, when we see so many of you who are the cells, cells of this heart, who are awakened, who are so united, who know each other, who understand each other, work together, pump the blood of love, it’s really the most happiness-giving, you can say joy-giving, are the greatest fulfilment of My desire. I see you here working like small children, playing about, joyous, happy, giggling. Helping each other, learning how to be one with each other - I really feel the blessings of God have come down on this earth.

You know that heart is the most important organ in the personality of the universe. And the human beings have to become aware of that point, who live here. That we have to live together, work together. If in the heart, even if there is one muscle who tries to stand out it can create immediately instant death. Instant death. So all of you who are awakened have a very, very special, very, very special responsibility.

Now, I have noticed there are two types of people, as we know that. Left-sided and right-sided. And a third type which are the combination of both. And then a fourth type who are in the center. We have to belong to the fourth type. And here, one sees how on the physical level we combine both the things. One side is too much organizing and too much of thinking. The another side is lethargic, laziness, all these things are there. The net result of both is that you cannot produce any results.

If you plan too much, if you think too much, you end up with it you are so fagged out to do anything. And the left-sided never get up to do it (laughter, Shri Mataji laughs). So ultimate result is that you achieve nothing. Even on the physical, the material, the mundane type day-to-day life. So, when you are in the center you witness, you start witnessing. When you steady yourself in the center. Because some people are such that they start on the left, go to the right, they become so ego-oriented that it’s impossible to deal with them. But if you stay in the center, that’s the fourth side, is staying in the center.

Turya is the fourth dimension. If you could stay on that, then you become a witness. And that’s the point where you start sucking the joy of every moment. Every moment, of every doing, of every work, of every friendship, of every relationship, of every understanding. You will see some people who will be here will develop tremendous respect and friendship with others. Because they’ll discover lot of qualities, lot of talents, lot of beauties in other people. There’s no other way we can find out. I think this is the greatest way one could provide, is to work together and to understand each other, appreciate each other’s work. And this will help us again to work out Sahaja Yoga together. It was like a festival throughout I felt about the whole place here. I felt so blessed with so many children, helping Me here.

The work doing is not so important as yourself steadying in the center. That’s the main point. It’s not what work you do, what work you furnish, that’s not so important. It’s the steadiness within you, with which you do the job or whatever you do. It’s the enjoyment of sharing with each other is the main point, is a training, it’s a training here.

I hope we’ll have another chance again some time, maybe in India when we build our ashrams. Or maybe in England when we build our ashram here, I hope so. Then we’ll have again the same opportunity to work together for joy’s sake. Not for anything else, just for joy, for your steadiness. To be steady in the center. To put the attention in the center. Without steadying it you cannot ascend. Everybody seems to have gained, I felt when I saw them, they are much better now. So we have to give up our misidentifications with our previous styles of life, previous types of living, previous types of executing any work, and we have to understand that we are not to plan. This house is built for Me. I’m the power behind the whole universe, so you don’t have to plan, you just start off.

But once you start planning then you depend on yourselves, which is a very limited thing. You just start planning and you are left behind. You just get to it. When you start thinking of any problems and all that, then you are lagging behind. Just start off and everything will come forward, you’ll find everything, it will be all there just before you, before your eyes.

Like the other day they said we don’t find a wood we need very much of a particular thickness. And they were trying to sort of reduce the thickness by rubbing it with some very, very harsh type of noisy stuff, which nobody could bear. So, I just said, “What, what kind of a thing you want? See ahead of you.” And just in front of them was lying that same type of wood that they wanted. Just ahead of them. It was just there. You see how it’s happening? What’s working out? It’s the Hanumana who works out many things for you. It is the Gauri who is to be adorned. And it’s the duty of Hanumana to help you out. He plays tricks with you. Always, you see, He is the one who makes you think, He makes you plan, He makes you everything and then topples you down. You see, that is His style, always. And He has made this with, made [unclear word] with so many people like that. Is that He made them think, plan, plan, plan, plan, and ultimately they find all plans fail.

So, if you are too organized, you’ll never enjoy. You have to enjoy each other’s company, you have to enjoy all the little, little things there are. If there is everything perfect, or absolutely sort of a machine-like, when you go on tick-tick-tick-tick-finished, there’s no enjoyment. You have to lose your way somewhere. You have to find something out. You have to go about, you have to ask someone. Like making mistakes also is important. Sometimes if you make mistakes - like somebody makes mistakes by putting the thing in an angular way, say, a decoration in an angular way, and it turned out to be a very beautiful thing, you see. So making mistakes is also good. This is what I’m trying to show to all of you. By mistake also, if you are driven to some place you might find something great.

So, our time is never wasted. Wherever we are, we are. We are never lost. We are never lost for anything. Time stops for you. So once, you see, you understand that we are not to worry about these things, which the people worry. We are not to worry about things for which people just give their lives. We are here for joy. And joy will come to us, whatever it is. So we should seek joy, happiness, friendship and this is a very, very good opportunity. Luckily the builder ran away (Laughter), I was very happy. I wanted to have this opportunity, some opportunity where all of us could get together and work together and have some nice time together. It was really very enjoyable.

I enjoyed it thoroughly and I hope we’ll have more chances to do that. But the more you are in collectivity and in the blessing state, the better it would be. Always in your other lives, other things also. Because you are realized souls. You are saints, you are different people from others. You have the help of the Gods, all the angels are helping you, everybody is helping you. But when you depend too much on your understanding, on your planning, then you go off. Then you cannot, then you can never enjoy the planning of God, the help of God, the complete drama. You suddenly find, oh God, it’s there, all done for you. How beautifully it is done, how things working out. It’s very interesting.

This house is a very, very old, old, old, old house, you see. And even if such an old house can be made so beautiful, what about human beings? They can all become very beautiful, glorified and very active in Sahaja Yoga. Very active. The whole thing is the experiencing of the joy of recreating something that He is already doing. Whatever God has created, human beings as such, it’s all in a mess. I feel human beings are in a mess. And they are to be recreated, they are to be improved, they are to be worked out. For that, who is going to work it? It’s you. You are the ones who have to do it. I can create houses, houses, after that way I can create universes, as you know that. But I have to use you. You are the channels, without you I just can’t do it. And that’s why you have to be very, very alert. Very alert and attentive as to how you go about.

Now, today is the first days for the house-warming ceremony. And another is the birth of Christ. I won’t be here, I’ll be in India. We celebrate in India the birth of Christ actually. It should be more celebrated here than in India, but somehow or other you always have snowy Christmas. Which was not there, at the time of Christ when He was born, there was no snow, you see. But in England, it’s a special blessing that you have snowy Christmas. And this time I hope you’ll enjoy all of you a nice Christmas of great warmth and love among yourselves.

And Christ came on this earth with a very, very great message for all of us. And He has done so much, you can see that without His awakening you cannot get Realization. You have to pass through Him, He has made this place. To create the Agnya chakra in that beautiful way and to keep it alive and to give enlightenment is a very difficult thing. It’s a very funny plug into which you have placed Him. Because of the modern kind of life people become against Christ. It develops your ego and it goes against Christ. If you develop your superego, of course it goes against Christ. So both the things, ego or superego, both the things are to be looked after by one person. Both contrasting things are to be looked after by one person. It’s too much. And these both things, those both problems we have. So, then, when we are born, when we are born on this earth, we are born in innocence. Which is also so rare because of the way we live, the way the fashion is, you can say, the way the ideas are.

But you all have to be against it, absolutely against it. Collectively, if you oppose these ideas, you’ll stand for Christ. You must write to all the churches, all the people. What have you done? What have you done to our people, where is the morality behind it? There is no morality, people are so immoral. How can they become saintly? This is not the way, to just have just church buildings and run the Soho land for the church. Church is owning the Soho land. Can you imagine? All these things you must oppose and you should say, “We’d like to know why, why should you, when Christ has judged, ‘Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.’ What about the chastity part of it? When are you going to look after it?” All the Christian nations are just the opposite of Christ’s principles. And so you all have to prepare yourselves, talk about it.

So there should be no more silence. There should be no more silence. Public opinion is a very, very big thing in the modern times. That’s a very, very big thing you have got and silence is to be abhorred. Absolutely. Because people who are doing wrong have a conspiracy of silence. They conspire, and then they keep silent: “All right, doesn’t matter.”

Democracy, as far as Chile is concerned, all right. But as far as Argentina is concerned will be this way. It’s like that. You see, they keep a silent mouth. Whatever is not bad for us is good, that’s how. And then, “don’t say anything, don’t say anything.” Sahaja Yogis have to be extremely bold and extremely outspoken and they have to say that this is all wrong, absurd. It is not for us. Not that they are uncomfortable, but it’s are against life, against Christ, against our emancipation, and this has to be given up.

And today you must vow that now as your house is settled down, your backbone is strengthened, you have to take a vow that you will stand for Christ. And for His great morals, and for the great things He said, that we have to be. And we have to tell people, “What are you doing? This is wrong. You cannot do it.” They are more vocal when it comes to something degrading, like drinking. If you don’t drink they’ll say, “Why don’t you drink?” They will force you. “Why don’t you drink? You must drink, you must have this.” But when it comes to morality, nobody dares anything. We don’t discuss religion, very good. This is the silent conspiracy. We don’t discuss religion, because if we discuss we are not religious. So people have to speak about it. All of you have to speak. Then only your left Vishuddhi will be all right. Now the only guilt that will be working in the Sahaja Yogis will be that for Sahaja Yoga we are not doing anything.

You must speak. You must talk about it. You must give Realization. Move your hands, move your legs. You have to walk across for God’s work, even if you have to beg you have to do that. This is God’s work. And one has to do that, God’s work, with all dedication, with all surrendering and with all love and enjoyment.

So, may God bless you all.

I’m very happy. C.P. is very much thankful to you and he also wants to say a few words to you. He might come after the puja. He said, “I would like to address to them.” He’s so surprised and he said, “These are really transformed people, I can see they are transformed. They are not normal human beings...” (Laughter)

So it’s nice to get a certificate from a person who has not seen. Then he said, “I see now, I have seen them before.” Specially he saw Marcus long time back and today, Marcus, he says, “He is so different, everybody seems to be so much changed and so much different that I’m amazed how human beings can be transformed.” He says it’s visible from their faces how they are happy with each other, how they are satisfied, how they are kind to each other and all that.

He was very much surprised how they are so friendly and how they are so generous and all that. He was really surprised. And how they laugh and enjoy, he was really surprised. He told Me that. At least ten times he has told Me, “That really surprises me how you could transform these people into such beautiful things.” So it’s really a big certificate I think from him (laughter), because he normally doesn’t give certificates like that.

So I was really very much enamoured, and just to make your Mother very happy, he’s bought two saris for me (laughter) today, which you will see later on, he has bought two gold things for Me, just to glorify the Mother of so many children.

May God bless you.

It’s something I’ve thought of The Three Wise Men brought presents for Christ’s Mother.

You see in the same way I felt today, the way he brought saris for Me and gold for Me and all that. Not for anything of his personal but is the way he saw that Sahaja Yoga has worked out. Really surprised.

So may God bless you.

This is her magic ...band (She plays with a child)

Should we have now – so accordingly we should have only Ganesha Puja because is a Bhoomi Puja is what - Ganesha to be established. And it has double process, because it’s the puja of Christ and puja of Ganesha. Just look at this, how sweet it is. So it’s made by some Indians and it’s very good, you know. It is made by hand, you see, that’s what is wrong, I found out.

It’s all made by hand. Because if it is not made by hand you’ll find those joints, you see, somewhere, there are no joints in that.

So, they have made, of course, two different things, but then they have tried to - molds, these are molds, and then they have put it together.

And this is for your ceramic.

All right, so should we have the puja now of Shri Ganesha.

Now. Where is my purse?

He’s got two things for me, they’ll be happy, like this [Shri Mataji shows a necklace]. And this one, even better, I don’t know. From Uruguay he got it, I think. Or from Peru.

[Aside conversation] All right. I’ve discovered some great artists also, among you today. One of them is Dawn, I never knew she is a very great artist and she has done some very good work on daisies, I was surprised.

Beautiful. Then we have got Rosie, is another artist. And Linda is another person who is very good at painting. So many things I have discovered. Then Danny, you see, he has a name which means dynamic (laughter), he is another very responsible person.

Chris is a great person. I mean, one better than the other, you can’t imagine.

The other day I wanted to – (Shri Mataji gets interrupted by a little girl and She bends towards her) Yes, Madam? Alright. Anything, you see, anything that they did, was so remarkable, even the skirting. And everything they did with such precision, this thing. Then I was surprised that Finn and John are such good tilers, and they did paperwork too. I was really amazed. Really amazed.

Pat and Norman have done all these works. I had said this is a factory for you, it’s a factory work, factory work you have done.

And everyone, you see, was doing such good work.

The greatest is Ferguson, because he did all the plastering, all the plastering. And Gavin came and behaved as the guru [unsure], and then Alan... (laughter).

Ian was there, his brother came from France. And I mean, I can’t, I mean, in one lecture I can’t tell you how much I have seen it.

So I’m saying for all of you, those who have worked very hard here, very, very hard, with such good work, such sensible things, and such nice, loving things that’s really surprising, how it has worked out.

And [...] was there, with his practical side of carpenter, and really remarkable to see he’s so responsible, he’s properly working it out.

(Aside) What’s it?

Now Coolie is coming to do some gardening work that I saw him doing there. And he has to combine with other people and work it out. And work it out so that you should develop friendship. That’s the main point. Deep friendship. Not a few, but all of you should be friends, there should be love among yourselves. And then know we have done so much work. And the most thing was, thing that surprised Me was Kay, the way she got, I mean, in a family way, she is sitting down and doing all the cleaning and all that, so sweetly, all the time she comes here. Graham took to it, and Ruth came in, and her husband Chris he was here, and then these two from Portugal, they came – I mean, it’s so, it’s so beautiful you can’t imagine.

Everybody has been so nice and so good. (Shri Mataji bends towards the little girl) And this lady has been the best of all, you see, ... our Melody. (Unsure) (Laughter).

You take one now, Ganesha’s, come along, eat all that. Watch the – how photographic is a laddoo? (Laughter. Shri Mataji picks up the little girl with the laddoo on Her lap to have a picture taken).

They are saying that they ask you, children, you see, they play, they say – “Hello Mister, how do you do?”. They say: “Just like a laddoo one bites too”. (She kisses and puts down the little girl) (Laughter)

Another silent worker is Joga Singh also, who has done such a lot of cleansing, you know, and he made his dedicated work. It’s really worth seeing the way he is dedicated. Very silent, and he is doing the worst work, is to clean the house. It’s very sweet of him, really, to do that way. Very good, and it has done good to him, also.

It’s very surprising how Phil joined it with such understanding, everything. It’s very sweet of him. And we have got Cathy, and Cathy also comes down and she helps you, quite a lot.

And Felicity, she is trying to do something, smoothing out things and everyone is working it out. There are people who have done so much work. And then Malcolm is doing nice paintings, I can see that there’s a nice painting on top.

And Ann has done some papering. She’s very good at papering, I was surprised, you know, she’s very good. And who helped you, first of all, yesterday?

Yogini: Phil, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Eh?

Yogini: Phil.

Shri Mataji: Phil first, and then?

Yogini: Alan.

Shri Mataji: Alan. Phil and Alan, they helped her to put the paper, which is a very, very very sort of a tricky stuff.

And then the energy was brought in by Ray from Brighton (laughter), and our great mister Yugoslav has done my, you see, for my room he has done the – what you call – the loft, you see. That’s very interesting he has done it. And also she painted – what’s her name, Janet – she painted the roof of my room, was interesting.

And David has taken out all the nails, you see. This is all Sahaj Yog, nails to be taken out, imagine, nails, horrible things. We have taken out so many nails like that, you see, when I was here all these things have happened.

And I am seeing [...] has, I am told, has done some patching up. You see, this is how we live.

We have to patch up, we have to take out the nails sometimes, you see, you have to paint, you have to encourage, you have to glorify, you have to do all these things, so much is there. And everybody has worked so much here! Marcus has put some of these, and Danny has put... I mean, there’s... I tell you, one by one everybody has done...

Chris has done the bases, what you call, the bases of this, and Marsha has come to encourage. I mean, quite say all of them have come and the way even people from Hampstead came down to help us in their special dresses... (Shri Mataji laughs, laughter). And it was nice to see them in those raggy dresses, you see, because that’s what it is, we don’t see people in that dress normally. So it’s very very good, very good, I tell you, really. I enjoyed myself.

And Rajendra and Najir, both of them came, Rajendra with his backbone trouble he came, you see. He was also working it out. I mean, it was all that, then we have Kay and Patricia.

You see, Patricia for a change was rhythmically taking out the paper, you see, I could see the musicians working on this rhythm (laughter).

Such a new style, you see. And the one who did our pillaring is from Australia, the great Hugo he did the pillaring – he put pillars, you see, to support, show that they support, support is needed. That’s another thing.

And then Susan came in, David, all these people they helped us so much.

With I mean, I don’t know how many names I should take for everyone, and even people from Cambridge came down just to help me here, everybody helped me. And people from Brighton – I can say in general, all right? I need not take everybody’s name now, because we are so many that even if I take your hundred names, you see - you take my hundred names it is one person’s hundred names, is equal to the hundred names of hundred people, isn’t it? (Shri Mataji laughs, laughter). And that’s what it is.

And everybody should feel that I remember you all, even I have to thank David Prole because he made us buy this house. (Laughter, Shri Mataji laughs)

All kinds of nice things have happened and we have so many people over here. Maria, you also came here... I saw you. But the best ones, Jack and Jill, where are they? Are they here? Both of them came, David and - Jack and Jill are there - David and his wife Hesta both of them came in a dress, looked like Jack and Jill, where are they, you see (laughter).

And Maureen came one day, she did some good job, and – I mean, it was really good with her, Athena was here and they did some work. And everybody has put something in down here, and John Watkinson I must say was very good at putting up these roof things, he has done.

And this is done by Nick, half, but he is finishing this (laughter). There has been very very nice room for everyone. Don, you also came one day, isn’t it? Don and his precious wife, she’s called Roxana, she came. All of them came down here, every day, and somehow I have seen one by one, working out.

Good. And the little girl from, what’s her name? Alyssa, Alyssa, who came all the way from Bristol. All was very interesting. And I think you people also came from... Chile people came down, there’s no end to it, and here is the one great thing, he also worked very hard.

All of them have, have done so much, so much. And I’m very happy about it.

Regis was there too. Regis has done the basement, and I think I have taken everybody’s name. (Laughter) Anybody’s name I’ve not taken, please raise your hand. (Laughter, Shri Mataji laughs) Maybe, you see, I may have missed one or two persons here and there.

And Datta was giving us a good chorus all the time (laughter), and Anais came in and she was at my feet most of the time. And then we had Bumble, Bumble did all the colouring training, she did all the training, you know.

And she also came and we had some bananas together, all right? (Laughter, Shri Mataji laughs). And you came in Hampstead (unsure), otherwise all of them were here, and this thing.

And the way Pat, you see, Pat has very much changed now, he is a very different person, I must say. I was very happy, he’s so changed.

He’s become now very sweet, you see, because his organizing way has gone away, and his wife also came to help us here, Yugoslav style, and – no, I mean, Polish. She was very very good, I should say, the whole thing. Jeremy was sweet to draw out a very nice fireplace. And I mean, everybody helped us.

Now, Alan, who was the real architect behind the whole thing, I don’t know if he’s here, but he was of such a help! You can tell him that “Mother remembered you very much, and...”. All these people, they have arranged. He also helped us so much, all of you are really remarkable, all those who have helped, that have been nice, actually you have helped yourself.

And Harry was very sweet and he was doing lot of cleaning, what sometimes he did get into problems (laughter, Shri Mataji laughs). But he laughed at it and enjoyed it, he didn’t feel bad. You see, that’s how you have to make mistakes, I think, not to feel bad about it (...).

It’s very interesting to see how things work out, and how it is just good.

(Shri Mataji speaks to a little girl) And you never came! She did, she did come, she did come for a while. And now one – she said this she wants? Laddoo? No. Now come along, finish this. No.

Thank God, thank God! (Laughter, Shri Mataji kisses the child) Sit down, sit down, sit down. Sit down, sit down, sit down.

Laddoo, thank you. It should be done. Now I was thinking about, you see, she’s already done. Done here and here. All right (laughter). She’s done her work, you see? (Laughter). We can have a small puja of Ganesha. But is a thing of festivity. Not to feel bad about anything, not to feel unhappy, but to feel happy.

Deep down people have hurt egos, some have ego, some have more super-ego. This is an occasion to feel happy, for everything that is there.

And not to feel bad, or not to feel unhappy.

Some people might be feeling because I have not taken their names, maybe, or I do not know what it is, but I have a feeling that there is a little ripple of that somewhere.

So just take away (...), just take away – it’s all, all that is there, I know all of you very well.

And only the understanding comes through vibrations, how much I love you. Only through vibrations. And it was really to feel how you are receiving my vibrations. That’s the main point is.

Who did the skirting? He. He did the skirting.

Very well, I must say, beautifully he did, for my room.

And what did you do? You were doing something, I saw you doing something.

Yogi: Supervisor. (Laughter)

Shri Mataji: Eh? What did he say?

Yogi: Supervisor. (Laughter)

Shri Mataji: Supervisor! (Laughter) Nick. Nick was supervisor, he says. (Laughter). Supervisor the great, you see, he was.

Bala also came to help us, with his aeronautical knowledge everywhere. Who else is there that have been? Practically everybody is done.

He was there, she was there, and she’s done...

(A child cries. Shri Mataji: “Now what is it? What do you want? ... Sit down. Eat this laddoo, come along. Come along... See how I am doing.)

Now, should we have the puja? All right?

Just you can move forward a little, I think it’s there. Now should we read the second piece, you see? Please read this.

Now, wash my feet. Come along, wash my feet, come along. Sit down. Sit down there. You have to wash my feet. Is it warm enough? Warm, isn’t it?

Yogi: It’s warm, yes.

Shri Mataji: (One yogi coughs) That’s the typical Vishuddhi. They have made of this a real puja hall. As soon as the puja is over, Dawn, you have to get the food there. And you must thank this man also (laughter, Shri Mataji laughs).

And go and get the food in here. Food and also get the servants too from there. But actually Shrivastava will come first, and when he goes back then the servants will come because there’s nobody in the house then, in the whole house they were sent. So C.P. will come here. When C.P. goes back, then you can get the food.

All right.

Wash it, come along, let the children wash.

[Conversation aside with yogis about washing of Feet: “See these people, come along. You see, these three people... You have done once in there, isn’t it, you have done it once. Because they are going away now... Come along”] The Ganesha you can keep it for a while this side. It’s there, Gavin can... You can, because you occupy very little space, you can push it...

[Puja continues with the recitation of mantras and the washing of Feet. Shri Mataji: “Let him read... All right. Now you should read the Ganesha’s. You can get a towel. Where is a towel? Have you washed? You wash”.]

Gavin: “Let our ears hear that which is true. Let our eyes see that which is pure. Let our beings praise that which is Divine. And let those who listen hear not my voice but the wisdom of God. Let us worship with the same song, the same strength and the same knowledge. And let our meditation enlighten and enrich. Let there be amongst us compassion and peace”.

Shri Mataji: See, compassion and peace. The peace comes out of love, out of understanding. Peace is a very important word today. Peace.

See now, for the Goddess it is said: “Ya Devi Sarva Bhuteshu Shanti Rupena Samsthita”, is the Goddess who resides within us as the peace within. The peace within is the Goddess. That is the power of the Goddess. (42.40)

All right.

Gavin: “Now, the prayer. Salutation Shri Ganesh, sakshat Shri Jesus, sakshat Shri Nirmala Devi namoh namaha.

It is You who is the beginning of all the beginnings. It is You who is the doer of all deeds which have been done, are being done and will be done. It is You who supports all things that are supported”.

Shri Mataji: So I should have said that I must thank Nirmala Devi also, for doing everything. (Laughter). All right. Because I am beyond Myself (laughter, Shri Mataji laughs).

All right? Little more than that.

Can you? Now stand... Can you move it? You may take out this. Who will carry this water?

Will be there, better. This water should be sprinkled all over the house, you see. And some you can take it if you want, to Portugal. Will be a good idea. See how much balancing is needed for water. Same is the attention! Same is the attention. You have to be in the center.

Now hard, press it, rub it very hard. Very hard. Ah, better, see? Now Gavin, you read, you don’t do all the things here.

Gavin: “It is You who protects all things that are protected. It is You who is the complete, all-pervading Spirit. God’s Divine energy. Think clearly brain. Speak only the truth. Let Your presence in us speak. Let your presence...”.

Shri Mataji: Presence in us, in you, should speak.

Gavin: “In us listen; let Your presence in us bless”.

Shri Mataji: You bless others. By your presence, but in that is the presence of your Mother.

Gavin: “Let Your presence in us protect; Let Your presence, in us, Your disciples, be The Disciple”.

Shri Mataji: You have to be a disciple. A disciple has to obey, and not to argue. If you argue then you are no more a disciple. Disciple temperament is there. See, it’s not to argue, but to obey, obedience. Because if you know that it is for your good alone, you should just obey and not to argue. If you argue or pester, then it is not a discipleship correct. You must keep the thing Prasanna, means pleased. Now, read.

Gavin: “You are all literature, and You are the ability to understand the literature; You are the Divine combination of complete Truth, complete Happiness and complete Energy; And You are more; You are all knowledge and You are the use to which the knowledge is put. You exist until the end of all things and after the end of all things You are. You create the end of all things and after the end of all things You remain indifferent. You are the earth, and You are the water; You are the fire and You are the air, and You are the space above the air. You are the Gunas and You are beyond the Gunas...”.

Shri Mataji: And a miracle took place, you see? Linda lit a flame, you see, of fire. Quite far away, about five feet away from me. And the fire just came and went round me. And she got frightened, thinking that Mother, She is burning. Nothing happened. It went round, then went back. It wants to get purified, fire knows people that are divine, how can I be burnt?

Gavin: “You are the body and You are beyond the body. You are the essence of time and You are beyond time. You and only You exist at the Muladhara chakra. You are the Spirit and You are beyond the Spirit. All those who would join God, meditate upon You. You are Brahman, Vishnu, Rudra. You are Indra, Agni, Vayu. You are the Sun at noon, You are the full moon. Through all these, and more, You are the all-pervading energy of innocence and wisdom”.

Shri Mataji: Innocence and wisdom, go hand in hand, you see? When you are not innocent, you are not wise. You have seen the example of that, of many people coming down here. They have lost their innocence, and they have no attention properly made.

Gavin: “You are the divine servant who stoops to wash the feet of saints”.

Shri Mataji: See the humility, see the humility. Just how to make the thing all right it goes to any limit. Any limit, just to make you all right. To wash the feet of the disciples, imagine, the humility. Then how much you should have humility?

Gavin: “You are the tiny core of all things without which the larger have no purpose.

You are the key to the libraries of all the scriptures, without which the Truth is hidden; You are the full stop which completes the sentence, and without which the sentence loses its meaning; You are the Crescent Moon; You are the Stars; and You are beyond the Stars; All things, from tiny dot to Universe, is You.

You are in the future and beyond the future; You are in all forms; You are where the sounds combine; You are the silence between the sounds; You are the rhythm of all music and all prayers; This is the knowledge of Nirmal Ganesh, and You, Nirmal Ganesh, are the master of that Knowledge, and all Knowledge.

You are the God and You are the Goddess.

Om Gam Nirmal Ganapataye.

To Your powers, Ganesha, let all surrender; Let the left side of memory and the right side of action surrender to You and let Your enlightenment prevail.

[A small child is crying during washing of Feet. Shri Mataji: Just take her. All right. What happened? Take her. Can you take her, like that? Back...]

Your first tooth You have, and four hands; one holding a rope, the second a goad, the third is raised in blessing and the fourth offers sustenance. Your banner is that of a humble mouse. You have long ears and are clothed in red; Red decorates You and You are worshipped with red flowers.

You have compassion for those who love You, and it is for those who love You that You come to this Earth. [Video interruption]

Om Gam Nirmal Jesusye.

To Your powers, Aum Jesus, let all surrender; Let the left side of memory and the right side of action surrender to You and let Your enlightenment prevail. You are the Word that was the beginning; You are the Word that will be the ending.

You are He who was born of a Virgin, and died on the cross... [Video interruption]

(Shri Mataji is given a sort of a necklace to wear) This is from my mother’s house. From my father’s house... (inaudible).

Yogini: Beautiful.

Shri Mataji: Yes. This is my wedding’s gift. This from Ganesha you give.

Gavin (Reads from Chapter 5 of Devi Mahatmyam): “The Rishi said: Of yore Indras’ (sovereignty) over the three worlds and his share of the sacrifices were taken away by the asuras Shumbha and Nishumbha by force of their pride and strength. The two, themselves, took over likewise, the offices of the sun, the moon, Kubera, Yama, and Varuna”.

Shri Mataji: Gavin, you come this side, so somebody can give ... things.

Gavin: “They themselves exercised Vayu’s authority and Agni’s duty. Deprived of their lordships and sovereignties, the devas were defeated. Deprived of their functions and expelled by these two great asuras, all the devas thought of the invincible Devi.

‘She had granted us the boon, “Whenever in calamities you think of me, that very moment I will put an end to all your worst calamities.” Resolving thus, the devas went to Himavat, lord of the mountains, and there extolled the Devi, who is the illusive power of Vishnu.

The devas said: ‘Salutation to the Devi, to the Mahadevi. Salutation always to her who is ever auspicious. Salutation to her who is the primordial cause and the sustaining power. With attention, we have made obeisance to her.

‘Salutation to her who is terrible, to her who is eternal. Salutation to Gauri, the supporter (of the Universe). Salutation always to Her who is of the form of the moon and its moon-light and happiness itself. We bow to Her who is welfare; we make salutations to her who is prosperity and success. Salutation to the consort of Shiva who is herself the good fortune as well as the misfortune of kings.

Salutation always to Durga who takes one across difficulties, who is essence, who is the author of everything; who is the knowledge of discrimination and who is blue-black as also smoke-like in complexion.

We prostrate before Her who is at once most gentle and most terrible; we salute Her again and again. Salutation to Her who is the support of the world. Salutation to the Devi who is of the form of volition.

Salutations again and again to the Devi who in all beings is called Vishnumaya”.

Shri Mataji: Very important, left Vishuddhi. Vishnumaya.

Gavin: “Salutations again and again to the Devi who in all beings is termed as consciousness. Salutations again and again to the Devi who abides in all beings in the form of intelligence”.

Shri Mataji: Intelligence is little... Intelligence, actually it means the Subuddhi, you see, means the one that’s the real, sharp, pure intelligence. You got the pure intelligence, the better it is.

Gavin: “Salutations to the Devi who abides in all beings in the form of sleep.

Salutations again and again to the Devi who abides in all beings in the form of hunger. Salutations again and again to the Devi who abides in all beings in the form of reflection. Salutations again and again to the Devi who abides in all beings in the form of power. Salutations again and again to the Devi who abides in all beings in the form of thirst. Salutations to the Devi who abides in all beings in the form of forgiveness.

Salutations to the Devi who abides in all beings in the form of genus;

Salutations to the Devi who abides in all beings in the form of modesty.

Shri Mataji: So one has to be modest, you see. Those who are not modest, those who use harsh words, who are hot-tempered, who try to show-off, and talk in a very sharp way, are not near this.

You have to talk in a sweet, modest way. Modesty is not - is a sign of your proper breeding. If you are ill-bred, then you do not know how to talk modestly. And that means, the blame comes to your Mother.

There was somebody who talked very sharply the other day, in a sharper way, and tried to show off in this place. And there were some people who had come, outsiders, they saw it and they were surprised. That is true.

You have to be extremely modest.

Gavin: “Salutations again and again to the Devi who abides in all beings in the form of peace; Salutations again and again to the Devi who abides in all beings in the form of faith”.

Shri Mataji: Faith. You see, what gives you faith also, what makes you believe things: it’s that power.

Gavin: “Salutations again and again to the Devi who abides in all beings in the form of loveliness”.

Shri Mataji: You have to be a lovely person and not a crooked person, not uncouth, but a lovely person.

Gavin: “Salutations again and again to the Devi who abides in all beings in the form of good fortune”.

Shri Mataji: And that’s how the good fortune comes to you.

Gavin: “Salutations again and again to the Devi who abides in all beings in the form of activity; Salutations again and again to the Devi who abides in all beings in the form of memory; Salutations again and again to the Devi who abides in all beings in the form of compassion”.

Shri Mataji: Memory, now, memory – people talk: “I think I know, I think I...”.

It is a “I think”. That’s not the way.

Memory is: “You know”. This is it, that’s how. You should test your memory, you see, like that, “Yes, I know this is it”.

Gavin: “Salutations again and again to the Devi who abides in all beings in the form of contentment”.

Shri Mataji: Contentment.

Gavin: “Salutations again and again to the Devi who abides in all beings in the form of mother”.

Shri Mataji: That’s what I said, contentment.

It’s not discontented. That you, this is not there so you are unhappy, that is not there so you are... unhappy. That is not – the way you should decide is you should never be unhappy.

Everything is all right. All right, it might have been this, it might have been that. Contented with whatever you have, to be contented. That’s how you are using the power, otherwise you are not using it.

Gavin: “Salutations again and again to the Devi who abides in all beings in the form of error”.

Shri Mataji: (She laughs, laughter) That’s a good one. I told you, if you don’t make errors, you won’t reach the right place. You won’t learn, and you won’t reach. Error – it is little bit error here and there you find it there, you see.

Gavin: Salutations to the all-pervading Devi who constantly presides over the senses of all beings and (governs) all the elements; salutations again and again to Her who, pervading this entire world, abides in the form of consciousness. Invoked of yore by the devas for the sake of their desired object, and adored by the lord of the devas...”.

Shri Mataji: But you are the devas, all right? So you have to invoke those powers.

Gavin: “And adored by the lord of the devas every day, may She, the Ishwari, the source of all good, accomplish for us all auspicious things and put an end to our calamities! And who is now again, reverenced by us, devas, tormented by arrogant asuras...”.

Shri Mataji: And those who are arrogant, or argumentative, are really asuras in a way.

Gavin: “Called to mind by us obeisant with devotion, destroy that very moment all our calamities. The rishi said: O Prince, while the devas were thus engaged in praises and (other acts of adoration), Parvati came there to bathe in the waters of the Ganga.

She, the lovely-browed, asked those devas, ‘Who is praised by you here?

And an auspicious Goddess, sprung forth from her physical sheath, gave the reply: ‘This hymn is addressed to me by the assembled devas set at naught by the asura Shumbha and routed in battle by Nishumbha. Because that Ambika came out of Parvati’s physical sheath (Kosha), she is glorified as Kaushiki in all worlds.

Shri Mataji: Kaushiki. See, because the Vedas – Kaku, you see, with her - she gives illusions to you. That’s why Kaushiki. Is the kosha, from the kosha, she came out.

[Puja continues. Shri Mataji is offered a comb]

So marble it is, isn’t it? It’s a marble colour. It’s beautiful. [Combing] Sometimes it goes to the left and sometimes to the right. (...)

A big mirror also you bring. He got two, but that one was even bigger, so I said one is all right. This is the mirror he got for me [a very large one, Shri Mataji laughs]. That’s a beautiful mirror, but too big [Shri Mataji laughs]. The roses have come from Pedro.

All the time these are also sending something for your puja. Isn’t it? [...]

Mirror also. It’s here... [Shri Mataji makes Her Bindi, aside conversation]

(Shri Mataji puts on kajal) It’s a real special one! (Laughter, Shri Mataji laughs) Look at the tears. All these are specially - you know, what is kajal made of is carbon, and carbon you know is Ganesha. (She points at Her eyes where kajal is put) So it worked. It’s a very very subtle thing. (1.09.05)

This time I will bring all the missing silver from India. Good.

(1.11.33) Now put left to the right. Let’s see.

Now raise your Kundalini. Raise your Kundalini (...).

You may come forward, too far away for him to take photographs, you see.

[Aside conversation. Shri Mataji is wrapped in a pink sari]

Tissue (1.14.56). That one you might find in Diwalis.

They give saris to the Goddess and She is completely covered in it, you can only see the saris and not Her face (laughter). This one’s for the Christmas, all right?

I think the Three wise Men who came, one of them must have been an Indian. (Laughter). (Shri Mataji looks at the sari around Her and comments:) This is Gauri Devi and Gauri’s style. All the chakras you can see.

Very beautiful.

(A further decorated cloth is wrapped around Shri Mataji and put on top of the pink sari. An Indian yogini says something.)

Shri Mataji: She said that, “You must put the expensive one on top”. So I said, “The one that is given by disciples is the highest of all, isn’t it?

Real Gauri. If you see a Gauri anywhere... you see nothing but saris, you know.

(A little girl crowns Shri Mataji with little crowns made of Christmas decorations)

What about you? It needs to be tied, it needs to be tied. Now, what about Chris? All right.

(Also another small child puts a decoration on Shri Mataji’s head, applause)

These are the little, sweet, innocent angels, you see?

(The decoration is then replaced by a sahaja yogini with a large crown)

Big one! (Laughter)

(The crown is white, with large red hearts on it)

Gavin: Mother, You are the Queen of Hearts. (Laughter)

Shri Mataji: Look at that. Really this size, you know? That’s how in those days women used to put something to keep their head covered, you know? Head was always covered in those days.

Different style now this.

Really. Even your Pope doesn’t have these things! (Laughter) (The crown is further decorated) Can you believe it?

First you have your aarti, and then you can do the rest of the thing. Good vibrations.

[Aarti follows – then video interruption. After the puja:]

Yogi: Mother, which song would You like?

Shri Mataji: Eh?

Yogi: Which carol would You like? Which carol would You like us to sing?

Shri Mataji: Oh, any!

Yogi: Any.

[“Silent Night” is sung.]

Shri Mataji: Beautiful. You can have one more?

Yogi: “Angels from the realms of glory”! Yes! It’s the last one on the sheet.

Shri Mataji: (After the song) Thank you very much. Beautiful. You have one more to sing? (Laughter) All right, one more. Something to be happy, something to be laughing (unsure). All right. [“Gloria in Excelsis Deo” is sung]

Shri Mataji: Beautiful. Thank you very much. Now, I think now we can divide in two halves because Mr. Shrivastava wants to speak to the people who have worked in this house. And those who go down can start their food and the rest of them will join. All right? (...) We can do like this, is to move out the people who have worked, he wants to talk to them... (instructions follow).

Sir C.P.: Dear Brothers and sisters, Dear Sahaja Yogis, Sahaja Yoginis, Dear friends. It’s very difficult to speak before a gathering like this.

But all I can say is I am very, I regard myself as a very greatly privileged to be a part of this marvellous family that I see here. You know I am serving, myself, the United Nations system, and the United Nations system is based on idealism. On the belief that all human beings are one family. But that is the basis, that is the philosophy, that is the foundation, and we have to make that work.

We, those who are privileged to serve that system, have to work in such a way that this philosophy is realized. But that is one thing, the plane of the United Nations. It’s a very, very hard, long way.

But what I have found myself is that, in the world of today, the problems that we face are not problems of material well-being.

Science, technology, evolution, they have all brought within our reach the resources which Mother Earth makes available and all of us can be happy.

All of us can be reasonably well-off.

And yet we are not. Is it because technology has not advanced? Is it because our knowledge of science is inadequate?

No, there is only one major element. And that major element is the human element.

It is the human being, human being at his best that can make this world a happy place for all of us. In other words, if mankind has to live and has to survive - you know we are living in a dangerous world, in a nuclear age - if mankind has to survive, then we can survive only on the principle of love. On the basis that there is a great human evolution, spiritual evolution.

The spiritual evolution does not mean that you get away from materialism. It means that the perspectives are right. That the prime importance is given to the Spirit. It is spiritual evolution which alone can make people feel that they are one, that they are part of a family.

Now the message that you are giving to the world, that is a message which the world needs.

It needs a new Messiah, someone who will tell the world that we are all one.

But if we are all one in reality, we must be not from just our lips but from our hearts.

We must sincerely believe that we are one, and if that message can get across, then alone human beings will survive and mankind will be at peace within itself and will be happy.

And when I see this family, my idealism gets greatly strengthened. Because in you I see a wonderful gathering of people. From all parts of the world, speaking different languages, professing different religions. And yet being together as if for ever and ever you have been together. As if you belong to one family.

The way I have seen you all, for example, here in this house or anywhere else, working together as if it is a festivity, it’s not work (laughter and applause). No matter what the problems, facilities none, implements very few (laughter). But with marvellous spirit.

It is that spirit which is within you, which fills me with emotion, with sentiment, with feelings of admiration. And I feel there is still hope for mankind. What you are doing is a practical demonstration of human nature, when it is developed, when it is at its best.

You know there have been philosophers, all kinds in this world. Philosophers often have said, human nature is essentially nasty and brutish and short.

This was [Jack Hobbes?]

I don’t agree with that at all. You may look at something and propound a philosophy, but your understanding of it may be totally wrong.

There are others who have held that human nature must be seen at its best if you want to know what human nature is. And I’m not trying to please you, but honestly when I see you and your faces, enlightened, kind, noble, I feel really elated.

And it is this which fills me with strength. It gives me strength, because in my own work, which is at another level, at a much lower level, you are at a very high level (Laughter), but I get strength from that. But there are ever so many frustrations in workaday life. But when I come to you, I’m near you, I feel that there is hope for mankind and we all can look forward to a better future.

Now, this Lady has been with me for many, many years (Laughter). We got married decades ago. And She has been a source of great strength for me as a wife, but I know in what affection and in what respect you hold Her. And this relationship again is a fantastic relationship.

I can assure you that She has always felt for everyone. Everyone, not just now.

We have had, for example, relations in our family. My own daughters and the children of others living with us. She always thought, in reality, all of them to be precisely the same.

And today, She probably belongs to me 0.1%, She belongs 99.9% to all of you (laughter).

But I am happy about this because I want to see this kind of relationship develop, become a reality. Where all of us can say mine and thine and ours together. And this is the way you are.

What can I say to you on this occasion? I want to express only my genuine joy, admiration and a prayer.

That the Almighty may strengthen this spark of Divinity in you.

That you may be the forbearers of a new message for mankind. You know, messages for mankind, they don’t begin with millions.

They always begin with a few, but a growing number. And your strength of will, your determination, will ... a new beginning. (Unsure)

You do not know what perilous days we are passing through. That’s on one side, but there is on the other side another movement which, to my way of thinking, is the movement that the world needs today.

So may I end my words, by expressing my very sincere gratitude. Not only for what you are doing, but much more for the new message that you are building. As a citizen of the world, I pray that your efforts may succeed, may have glorious success.

Please remain strengthened, firm in your belief.

The work you are doing is what the world needs. And in a spirit of humility which I see around you, idealism, joy, mutual love.

Please carry on, and regard me as a part of that. Small part of that endeavour.

And thank you again for giving me this wonderful opportunity to be with you all this evening. I am delighted that in this humble abode we are all together and we are making a beginning, with joy, with this wonderful togetherness.

And I’m too full now of emotion to be able to say more.

May God bless you all. A Merry Christmas, A Happy New Year to all of you.

Thank you very much.

Shri Mataji: Actually they all want to thank you very much for looking after their Mother so well. Isn’t it?

Yogis: Yes, yes, yes.

Shri Mataji: Can you all say thank you to him, that’s all.

Yogis: Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Yogini: We also thank you for allowing us to take so much of Her time.

C.P.: She belongs to you 99,9% (Laughter).

Yogi: Three cheers for Mr. Shrivastava: Hip Hip Hurray!

Shri Mataji: Secondly, they want to congratulate you for your election, a unanimous election, and the appreciation of so many different nations of your work. (...)

And thirdly they want to congratulate you for this house (laughter).

C.P.: I say this part of the congratulations go that side.

Shri Mataji: Congratulations to all of us. (Laughter) Thank you for the sweets also that you brought for us. And the dinner. (...)

So, should we now... I think the ladies should go down to organize for food and you should also go.

... They appreciated it very much. Both of them are beautiful, isn’t it? ...

It was very well. Very beautiful, very beautiful.

They are such things.

Keep the door open, for the people who need to go.

[Gifts are offered to Shri Mataji] (A Blake painting) It’s all right! Everybody should see.

Agnya. How could he see, you see? Somebody watching this himself can know that he was a great, he was a very high soul.

Good, that was very good.

(To the elderly gentleman who presumably has offered the gift) Thank you. It’s all gone.

(1.52.39) You have to cover your head too. (Inaudible words) Thank you. May God bless you. I’m happy, you look so peaceful now. Whole peace is here (Shri Mataji massages his forehead), whole peace is here, in this part, in the Agnya. Enjoy it, enjoy your own peace.

You can’t get joy from anybody else, you have to get it from yourself.

Like that, they can see (William Blake’s painting).

I couldn’t see: everybody had something to eat?
