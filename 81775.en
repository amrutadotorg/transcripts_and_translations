So, Mark, the story that we want to hear from you—this is going to be an interesting one. Would you please share with us this golf story? It's actually more than a golf story; it's about detachment. You're probably wondering how can that possibly be.

I worked as a product manager for a long time for a tech company, and we would often go to these sales meetings to explain our products, what's new, and all this. We'd do these presentations, and they would always have these golf tournaments. I worked for this company for almost 20 years, and I had just recently taken up golf, just before I got my realization, so I wasn't a very good golfer. I said, "Well, it doesn't matter. I'm a yogi now. If I play badly, who cares? I'll be detached."

So, we'd go to this sales meeting, and I'm matched with the CFO of the company, the top sales guy in the company—who's what they call a scratch golfer, a really good golfer—and another guy like me. We're one of the first ones to tee off at the first hole, so there are maybe 80 guys all standing around us, watching us tee off. I hit my ball out of bounds immediately. I keep going back and forth out of bounds, just playing horribly, like I'd never even played golf before. And so I see the CFO and this sales guy looking and shaking their heads like, "Oh man, this is going to be a long day."

We get to the third hole, and we're out on the green. My ball is crisscrossing; I can't quite make it into the cup. It's just crisscrossing back and forth across the green, and they just walk off. At this point, I'm anything but detached. I'm so embarrassed. I'm thinking, "Why did I ever do this?"

So then I pray to Shri Hanuman for detachment. For those who may not know, he's also the one that gave the Quran to Ahmed and told Mary she was giving birth to Jesus and all that. So, in India, Gabriel is known as Hanuman. I don't know why I decided to pray to Hanuman, but I did. I said, "Hanuman, please just make me feel detached." I didn't care about playing better, just give me the detachment. I knew playing better golf wasn't going to happen; I just wanted the detachment because I was so embarrassed.

We get up to the fourth hole. Everybody tees off. It's a shorter hole, a par 3, 150 yards or something like this. I get up, I swing my club, and the ball hits just in front of the cup, takes two bounces, and pops right into the cup. A hole-in-one!

Wow! And everybody around me is going crazy, because some people play golf their whole lives and never get a hole-in-one, never even see anybody get a hole-in-one. They are going absolutely crazy around me, and I'm like a statue. I swear to God, I never thought... I knew it was Hanuman that put the ball in the cup, right? It wasn't me. And I really have never felt more detached before or since that moment. I got the detachment like I'd never felt before in my life, and I'm like a statue.

Everybody's going crazy, "Do you know what you did? Do you know what you did?!" shaking my arm and all this. And I'm just... I said to myself, "Okay Mark, you have to feign excitement. You have to pretend like you're excited because this is just..." So I said, "Oh yeah, that was pretty cool," you know, like this. And they can't believe it.

Then, not only that, but I was having trouble with my driver, which is this really big club that you always start with, and I couldn't control it very well. So I just left it in my bag and was using my next biggest club, which is a three iron. The ball was going over 200 yards! It was going as far as their drivers were. They were looking at me like, "Where is it...?" So Hanuman was still just lofting my balls these great distances. The whole mood changed; everybody was having so much fun. The guy told me, "Don't ever get rid of your putter, just get it re-grooved, man!" The whole mood changed. I experienced the detachment, and actually the golf playing was better, but it was all Hanuman just saving my ball.

It was a perfect networking opportunity as well, work-wise.

And, you know, the other thing that happened, the more amazing, incredible story, is that I asked to share a room. When you have a couple hundred people together, they would buddy you up in rooms. I asked for this guy that I knew because I didn't want to be with somebody who'd been out drinking all night. I wanted somebody so I could meditate in the room. This guy I knew had become like a born-again Christian. We used to work together at the factory. So, we got a room together. And I'm thinking, "Well, maybe I can give this guy his realization." He's thinking, "Maybe I can turn this guy towards Jesus."

The first night I said, "Hey, do you mind if I set up a little meditation area?" So I put up Shri Mataji's photo and a candle and was meditating. Afterwards he said, "You know, when you were doing this..."—like the bandhan—"...nobody says 'I could see this light on your head,' like a..." and when he did this, it was like he smoothed it out, "...like a helmet around your head."

I wasn't sure if he was just messing with me, because the guy was known to tell stories. But he also had sleep apnea, where he could just fall asleep, so he was into this superconscious state. I said, "No, maybe he is seeing something."

The next night I asked him if he wanted to meditate with me, and after seeing this, he said, "Yeah, okay, sure, I'll do it." So I got behind him, and I was raising his kundalini. Oh, beforehand, he said he couldn't sit cross-legged because he used to play American football and his knees were wrecked. He had to stick his feet straight out towards Shri Mataji's photograph. As we know, that's not a really auspicious way to meditate, with your feet out to Shri Mataji, but he had no choice. He couldn't bend his knees.

So I'm behind him, I'm raising his kundalini, and I felt something just break. I put my hand above his head and felt this incredible cool breeze. I'm like, "Wow!" So, okay, let's just meditate. Afterwards, I asked him, "So, how do you feel? Do you feel anything on your head?" He says, "No, but I feel this cool wind on my feet." He had his feet out to Shri Mataji's photograph, and he got his realization through his feet.

When we went to bed that night, he's in his bed under the covers, and he's saying, "I can still feel the cool breeze on my feet."

That's amazing. Just to give it a picture, which golf course was it and which year was this?

It was in Chicago. And it had to have been probably '93, '94. Could have been as late as... I don't remember. It was in the beginning.

That's just incredible. They give you this little thing from the golf course, and I have it stuck away somewhere. I think next time, you can share that with us.

Yeah, but both experiences were pretty extraordinary, the golf and with the roommate.

And did he sort of stick to it?

One of the things about Sahaja Yoga is, you know, once we put ourselves in the attention of the Divine, we have to be very careful. We have to become dharmic. We have to be deserving of the gift we're being given. It turns out he was cheating on his expense reports, and he got caught. His wife blamed it on Sahaja Yoga, because she was still into this born-again Christian thing. So he wound up dropping it.

But that's the other thing I think I would want to share with people: we have to be very, very careful once we put ourselves in the attention of the Divine. The Divine is very forgiving, to a point, but if we are doing things that we know are wrong, we're going to get exposed. So, it's just living with those values but remembering the dharma and trying to do one's best, isn't it?

Yeah. Wow. Incredible. Amazing. Thank you so much, Mark. Thank you.
