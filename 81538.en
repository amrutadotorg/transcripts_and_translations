Pat and I came along on September 15th, 1975.

You're the one with the dates.

Sunday morning, was it? We were with a group of hippies, dropouts. It was Marie who took us, Marie from France. We got the bus down. I had to run after it because the people taking her thought I was in too bad a condition to go.

They thought I was a gone case, so there was no point in me going.

So we went there, and on the way, I certainly felt terrified. I had no idea why, because they just said it was their yoga teacher who didn't do exercises. I thought, "Well, that's a shame, because I'm quite good at those." On the way there, my feet were walking because I couldn't run away, but my heart was racing, and I didn't know why I was so terrified.

We went to this flat and had to leave our shoes, which was unusual for us. From my point of view, we just walked in the room, and I thought, "Oh, my goodness, she's a goddess." I had never, ever thought such a thought before; it's just what came to my mind. We were told to sit down, and Marie said, "Just put your hands out." So I sat down and put my hands out.

She asked us to come up so she could work on us. She put her hand on me and said, "This one's sick." That was my first introduction. She said, "He's got six months to live. What have you been doing to yourself?" She basically said I'd exhausted all the possible ways of damaging my chakras.

But when I walked in the room, I mean, I was in a bad state, but I was also quite aware of other dimensions of consciousness because of all the things I'd been doing. I walked in expecting a yogi lady with a quiet atmosphere, maybe someone tinkling a bell in the background. Instead, she must have been telling someone off very forcefully, a Sikh chap. The thing that came into my head when I walked in was, "Wow, this must have been what it was like to come across Christ teaching in the marketplace." Then I thought, "What do you mean? Where did that come from?"

I felt like the whole room was full of light, like I'd walked off a jungle pathway onto a big highway. Whatever it was, I just felt, "Wow, this is what I'm looking for." And it went from there, really.

Mother got up and walked over and said to me, "How do you feel? Do you feel anything in your hands?" I said, "I feel something in my hands." It just came to my attention, and I said, "Oh, I feel it!" She said, "May God bless you, you've got it." I had no idea what I'd gotten, but I'd gotten it. She said later that for six months she pinned my Kundalini up because it was so wobbly, and I was just there as a protection.

With me, she asked for some water, and someone gave her a bottle they'd filled. She took the bottle, turned around, and I saw her open a door into this huge atomic furnace. It was just this blinding light. She put the bottle in, took it out, turned around, and gave it to me. I didn't question it at the time; it was so amazing. I was just stunned. Afterwards, I wondered if she'd actually performed those physical motions, but that's what I saw and what I experienced. Then she gave me this vibrated water, which was amazing.

Oh, and she turned around and blew me a kiss as she left.
