It was the last time Shri Mataji came to Switzerland. She was on her way to China to give her speech at the Women's Conference, coming straight from Cabella and taking the plane in Zurich. Except, the plane from Milan was delayed. The Swiss airplane didn't wait for her and left, so she had to stay one night in Zurich.

We were following her from Cabella. When you go to Cabella, you take two or three saris plus the clothes for the number of days you're going to stay there, so I had no more fresh saris. All had been used. The only fresh clothes I had was a Punjabi dress—a red one, embroidered in a yellow, goldish color. It was very nice, but still.

That evening, a very small group of us who had followed her, maybe 10 people at maximum, were looking after Shri Mataji in her room. The following morning, I got up, had my shower, and put on the Punjabi dress. But I thought, "A married lady should go in front of Shri Mataji wearing a sari. I'm not properly dressed." So I decided I wasn't going to enter her room that morning. I stayed in the back, doing whatever needed to be done, but without going into her room.

Then, all of a sudden, someone opened the door of her suite's living room from the inside. I was just behind it and wasn't expecting it to open. Shri Mataji was just in front of me. She said, "Oh, hello, Maria Amelia, come in." I thought, "Oh my goodness," but I didn't say anything and just went in. She looked at me, smiled, and said, "What a beautiful outfit you are wearing. Come, let me see it."

So I went next to her, and she took the fabric in her hands, saying, "What a nice fabric. When did you buy it?" and all these sorts of things. "It's beautiful."

I smiled because I realized you have to have the right attitude. You're going to meet the goddess, so as a married lady, you wear your sari, the proper attire. The attitude has to be good. But she understands, and she knows. She was the one calling me in and admiring what I was wearing, even if it wasn't a beautiful sari. So it was the other way around. It was a nice story, and I was ever so happy.

I can imagine.

Well, that was it.

It's a lovely story.
