 (England)
It took a few months from my engagement to my wedding. My engagement was in May and my wedding was in December. During that time, certain things happened, like Chesham Road was bought, and I was living there. So, I will quickly relate the story from the beginning. To understand something about me, I'll start with how I got my realization, which will be very brief.

It was Mother Earth News magazines that gave me my spiritual awakening in 1975 in Poland. From being an atheist, overnight I felt the presence of God, and from that moment, dramatic changes happened in my life. I was able to come to London in 1975, after seven years of applying for my passport just to leave the country. I continued my seeking in London, going to various meditation groups and practicing Hatha Yoga as well.

Then one day in April 1980, I arrived at Caxton Hall and saw Shri Mataji for the first time. I had a very strong experience during the meditation, so to me, it was obvious that I had finally arrived at my destination. Of course, the personality of Shri Mataji was also very magnetic, and it was just impossible for me to do anything else except follow her wherever she went. She was touring many places in England at the time, so I used to travel in the back of her car, and we all did. I don't know how we fit in that car because it was a Mercedes, but sometimes there were seven or eight of us in there. The car was expanding.

Three weeks after my realization, I arrived at the Dollis Hill ashram in London for my first puja with Shri Mataji. Shri Mataji asked me to decorate her feet, and then I was in heaven, sitting on the floor for four hours. It was all getting dark, and I didn't know how long it was going to last, but it was four hours. After leaving the ashram, I felt like a new person—completely free, happy, and secure. I felt I was under Shri Mataji's wing, so to speak. I don't know why, but Shri Mataji knew that I was feeling quite insecure. I didn't want to go back to Poland, so Shri Mataji used to hug and kiss me quite often on seeing me. I just took it for granted and thought it was always going to be like this. When it stopped, I was quite disappointed, but somebody told me that I was ready to mature.

My first time in Sahaja Yoga was really nice. However, sometimes I could not understand the accents of the yogis because there were so many varied accents. Before I came, I used to spend most of my time with foreigners in London, so I could understand Shri Mataji's speech very well, but I couldn't always understand the yogis with their very strong accents. It was very hard for me to communicate.

Nevertheless, a couple of weeks after the puja, Shri Mataji suggested that I get married. There was a subtle reason for this, and I don't want to elaborate on it right now. I felt if I needed to marry, I would like to marry a good yogi. I think it was me, not Pat, who was first asked by Shri Mataji about the marriage. Shri Mataji said Pat was a very good person and she recommended him. So I said, "Yes, thank you very much," and I was wondering what would happen next.

I had seen Pat before at the ashram with his son, and I could feel the bond of love between them. That was perfect for me because I thought I would have a ready-made family. However, things were not that straightforward, because my future husband was clearly avoiding me. I thought it was not such a good start after all. I could see yogis looking at me, whispering, and giving me meaningful glances, so I thought something strange was really going on. A week or so passed, and I had no idea what was supposed to happen.

So I went to a house in Hampstead after a public program at the Friends Meeting House there. After the program, we stayed overnight. Pat was not communicating, and he left early in the morning. In Hester's house, there was a walk-in wardrobe. I don't know if anybody remembers that wardrobe, but Shri Mataji called me into it for a private conversation. She told me that with such marriages, it's like this: there are many people in the room, and everyone wants a perfect match. If everybody wants a perfect match, how is this possible? Then Mother asked me if I still agreed to marry Pat, and of course, I said yes. We both left the walk-in wardrobe, and Shri Mataji announced the marriage as an engagement, to begin with. Of course, I was wondering what Pat's reply would be because I didn't know.

Later that day, Pat met me with a huge bunch of flowers, smiling, and I thought, "Well, that was a good start." It is from him that I learned about the events of the past week and the reason why he was avoiding me. He was not keen on the match, as his previous marriage 12 years before was a real disaster, and it was no fault of his. It was not Shri Mataji who told him about the match; it was Peter Pearce who was told by Shri Mataji to ask him. Pat was caught by surprise and said, "Yes, of course, if Mother wishes," but he was too much in his mind about it. He decided to meditate on it, and to his astonishment, he felt his right heart melting and the vibrations becoming really strong.

So he became keen, but then there was another message from Shri Mataji canceling the match. As Mother said, he was not spontaneous enough in saying yes. Just imagine what a rollercoaster. He was devastated and was going for lonely walks, pondering how many former matches he would have in Sahaja Yoga. He was writing letters to Shri Mataji saying he wanted to get married, but if he was not spontaneous enough, it only meant he was caught by surprise. Until the morning of Shri Mataji's announcement, he didn't know whether he was going to be married or not. Unfortunately, that morning, he left early for work, so he only found out from a phone call that he was matched. "To whom?" he asked the person on the phone. The person said, "I don't know. I couldn't hear." That was quite a funny story.

Anyway, we seemed to get on very well, so he decided to introduce me to his parents and his son, Kevin. He was quite confident that it would be all right for me to visit his parents. Despite my English, I was always very self-conscious about my accent and my English because I was only in the country for a short time. I was very nervous. So guess what happened on the day of the visit? I lost my voice. I couldn't say anything. I was thanking the divine for solving the situation—my saving grace.

During the engagement, I briefly lived in Hampstead at Mrs. Gulati's place. Some of you probably remember Mrs. and Mr. Gulati. They were the owners of the famous Temple of All Faiths, in which we had many weddings and marriages in Sahaja Yoga. It was actually a Hindu temple with a huge plastic statue of Shri Durga on the altar. We tried to get rid of the statue, but we didn't want to upset Mrs. Gulati, so it remained there. Mr. Gulati and her husband were very respectful to Shri Mataji and sometimes used to attend the pujas, though they were not really yogis or meditating.

Something amazing happened to us in London because around July, Chesham Road was purchased by Linda Williams. This was another miracle. She bought it, but the house was in need of renovation. An old lady was previously the owner, and she had hardly looked after it. It was great because it was the first ever ashram owned by a Sahaja Yogi. It was our own. I was asked to move there after it was bought. Linda, her husband, her daughter, and other yogis like Chaya, Regis, Louis, and Marcus were all living there.

As Antoinette probably remembers, the place not only needed repairs, it needed a lot of vibrational work because the vibrations were terrible. We used to burn candles in every room. We went around with ajwain. We played Mother's talks in every corner using tape recorders. We said many mantras. We tried to take the negativity out through the window. How we did that was we held our left hand towards the room and, with the right hand out of the window, we were taking the negativity out. Actually, it worked. I do recommend it if you're ever in trouble in places. Shri Mataji used to vibrate lemons, chilies, coconuts, sugar, salt, honey, and ghee for us, so we could use all these things to work on the vibrations. And of course, we were meditating. It was quite difficult sometimes to meditate there, but it was getting better, and because we were in the collective, it was great.

However, we tried to fix things, but whatever we mended, another thing used to fall apart. It was like going a few steps upwards and even more steps backwards. You have no idea. You are so lucky having the ashrams that you have now. As has been prophesied, it was the foundation established in ruins. Because it was a ruin. We were told Chesham Road was the foundation of the New Jerusalem, so despite the difficulties, we were honored to be looking after it.

At one point, Shri Mataji was greeted at the doorway when she came for the first time. There was a small Shri Bhumi Devi puja offered to her on the doorstep. Later on, the offerings were put under a stone in front of the house, and Shri Mataji said she established Shri Ganesha there. The first child was also born there in August. This was another story because I remember Linda had contractions while Shri Mataji was speaking to her on the phone. In the end, Linda dared to say that she was actually having contractions because the conversation was getting longer and longer. Shri Mataji said, yes, she could feel the contractions, and told Linda to call the ambulance. Interestingly, the ambulance did not reach the Royal Free Hospital, which was on the other side of London. It stopped halfway, and the baby was born in University College Hospital in central London. We stopped there in an emergency because 10 minutes later, Linda delivered a baby boy. It was amazing because I was present at the birth, and for me, it was an amazing experience. I was quite scared of having children of my own, thinking I'm not going to go through this, but after that, it was so easy. I just thought, "Well, that's not that scary." Linda's husband arrived much later at the hospital because he went to the Royal Free, where the baby was supposed to be delivered. The boy was named Dattatreya.

Life in the ashram kept going on. We had one car, and it was Peter's yellow van, which we used for buying food in bulk and also buying lots of flowers in Covent Garden Market every week. Myself and Chaya, who was an Indian yogini, were not working, so we could spend all our time in a very basic kitchen on the second floor. We were cooking three meals and doing washing up all day, entertaining guests who were visiting all the time to see the new ashram. We were actually exhausted.

Once when Shri Mataji rang, she asked me how it was all going. Because I was quite new, I tried to say the truth. I said, "Well, it's all fine, but we're not getting much help." She told me off. She said, "You are creating a problem for me. You just sit down and watch it." So I did that, and it became much better because everybody started sharing the chores and everything became more collective.

Now I'm coming to the description of how the room where the wedding was going to take place was created. The extension, which is part of the meditation room now, was being built. At one point, Shri Mataji asked the men to put down the concrete for the floor in the night. She said, "Now you are putting down the concrete." They worked all night using all kinds of strange lighting. I remember this happening, and it was also very cold. While all these preparations were on their way, Shri Mataji called me one day and fixed the date of our wedding for the 5th of December. That was all great, but there wasn't a room to have the wedding in. For quite some time, I was observing the building work not really progressing as fast as it should have for the wedding to take place. This was a very trying time to exercise my witnessing power, and I don't think I was doing very well.

In the meantime, an Irish girl who lived across the road and was coming to meditate with us fell in love with Mia. On hearing about the upcoming wedding, they both asked Shri Mataji if they could get married too. Shri Mataji was sort of agreeing but was not happy with me for being overenthusiastic about it, possibly encouraging it. I am not sure, but I think I was encouraging it because I wanted as many people to get married as possible. Unfortunately, the marriage of Mia only lasted three weeks. Wendy left Sahaja Yoga, and Mia decided that being single was the easiest and safest option for him. So it's better not to fix other people's marriages yourselves.

The time of my wedding was approaching, but the roof was nowhere to be seen, and the walls were not plastered at all. They were just bare bricks. Nothing was much happening, and it was a cold December. I was quite depressed, thinking there was no change in the building work, no roof to be seen, and the place looked very miserable. I thought the wedding would not take place at all.

On the wedding day, the yogis were not fazed by anything. I saw them in the kitchen preparing food for the arriving guests. Close to tears, I was getting ready and went to a place across the road. Most of us were concerned about Shri Mataji coming to a freezing place with no roof and bare walls. After a couple of hours, a messenger from the ashram heralded the arrival of the roof. I was getting more hopeful. Still, when an hour later someone came to say it was beginning to look fantastic, I said, "I'll believe it when I see it."

I could not see things very clearly, as I had decided not to wear my glasses. I didn't want to wear glasses in the photographs. Quite vain. Eventually, some people guided us inside to what is now the meditation room. It was bright with carpets and saris hanging on the walls. A temporary roof was also there. The smiling faces of yogis and the atmosphere were just electrifying. It was truly divine magic in the air. Everything was transformed.

Shri Mataji came with the Hindu priest who conducted the ceremony. Some of the guests there were not yogis. Interestingly, Shri Mataji was wearing dark glasses, which you can see in the photographs later. I don't think that Shri Mataji spoke; there was no video or audio recording of it. It was an Indian wedding with Shri Mataji very much present. She fixed the turban on Pat's head out of her sari. You will see it in the photos. We were both given saris by Shri Mataji as a present, as well as blouses and other articles. Shri Mataji thought of everything.

Of course, because I did not wear my glasses, I could barely see where I was going while following my husband—or he was following me—around the fire. The whole ceremony was very moving, as you can imagine. I could barely follow the fact that Shri Mataji was just there, looking after everything. Afterwards, delicious food was served, and the atmosphere was very jolly. I don't remember much about what happened later on. When Shri Mataji departed, we were receiving good wishes and presents. It was all very sweet.

Finally, it was time for us to leave. On our way back, in the middle of London, we noticed we were running out of petrol. We managed to drive to a petrol station that was unfortunately already closed. We had to leave our car there, and we had our first argument about Pat not paying enough attention to details—I mean, not making sure there was enough petrol—and about who was going to catch the taxi. Those days, without mobile phones, we had to stand in the street in our Indian wedding outfits, late at night, to flag down a taxi.

When the taxi stopped, I got in and accidentally shut the door. The taxi zoomed off with Pat running behind. It took me a minute to alert the taxi driver to stop. Then, we had our second argument about me, for a change, not paying enough attention.

So, that's how it all started. We drove off, wondering how this was going to work. We are both quite different, if not opposite personalities. And yet, we have a very happy, successful marriage based on love, respect, and the freedom to be ourselves. We grow together, but not in each other's shadow. Mother's love, which brought us together, has created this unbreakable bond, and it has been our guide and strength in good and sometimes difficult circumstances. That's all I could say.

Host: That's a wonderful, wonderful story, Grazyna. That's beautiful. So, I think we're going to look at some pictures now from your wedding, isn't that right?

Grazyna: Yes.

Host: So, I'll share some pictures. And then, Caroline, you can tell the program. After that, I'll be asking Dr. Ashok Kumar Misra, who has joined us from India, to tell his story. So, after we've looked at Grazyna's pictures, I'll be asking him to share his story with us. I'll just get started sharing the pictures which Grazyna sent. Grazyna, if you want to say something while I'm showing the pictures, please go ahead.

Grazyna: Okay, so you see, we're both bowing to Shri Mataji's feet. And this is Shri Mataji, just going to arrange a turban on Pat's head. And that's her arranging the sari, making it into a turban. Those days, nothing was ready-made.

Okay, so now, of course, they're garlanding the brides. And we do the same. There is a fire, as you can see. And you can see some people here, like John Watkinson. There is Gillet there in the corner as well. That's Pat. You can see all the different expressions. Pat was wearing glasses. And that's me. I was not smiling because I was quite a bit nervous, maybe.

Now you can see... I don't know what we're doing. We're feeding ourselves or feeding each other. There is Danya behind me, you see? You can't see her face, but she's there. She took some of our... This is Danya in between me and... when she was a teenager. I don't know how old she was, maybe 15. And this is the priest you can see there. A Hindu priest. But it's funny because he was actually wearing a suit. He didn't come in kurta pajamas like one would normally do.

Here are some more photos. I am smiling now because it's all over. You can relax. Felicity is there behind Pat when she was young. And there were all these balloons hanging. You see, the backdrop was the door to the garden of the meditation room in Chesham Road. So these balloons were there and they were all released. It was very sweet. And of course, the children had fun with the balloons. So, smiling now. It's a very nice, beautiful picture. So that's it.

Host: That's wonderful. Wonderful. So Dr. Ashok Kumar Mishra, can I ask you to open your microphone and your video and relate your story to us?

[A brief exchange confirms Dr. Mishra cannot speak as everyone in his house is sleeping.]

Host: What a pity. Okay. So Grazyna requested me to play a video. Grazyna, if you can let us know a bit about it before I play?

Grazyna: Okay. So, it was December 1981 in Chesham Road. You will recognize the place where the meetings from Chesham Road are quite often on Zoom, where there is an altar now. Shri Mataji was giving presents to everyone, sort of like Christmas presents. She was saying goodbye because she was going to India. You can see all the yogis. She gave a speech before, but I just wanted to show the presents.

Host: Okay, I'll start it.

[Shri Mataji's Speech from Video]
For today's New Year, let us vow within ourselves that the selfishness or the self-centeredness or the smallness in you is finished. Now the drop has become the ocean. Live like an ocean and like a lion. Roar at others—I mean, generously. And don't be afraid of anything. Everything is taken care of, but believe that everything is taken care of. Sometimes you might feel you are let down. Sometimes you feel, "Oh, this should have happened." Do not desire for it. Whatever you desire is not correct that way. If the desire is correct and is deserving, it will happen.
You are a perfect person. So all the best and the greatest cheers and happiness and joy. Feel your responsibility. Understand each other. I'll be gone tomorrow, so-called. Don't worry about anything else, but worry about the Sahaja Yoga that has to be established all over the world. Very great work one has done. Of course, I mean you can say that one has done as much as one can do, but you can do much more. You can become really dynamic and you can do it. Try to think of ways and methods of doing it. May God bless you all.
So now, with all this green and blues, should we start giving presents now? It's nothing but an expression of your Mother's love. So don't worry... I haven't given any special present to anyone because I can't do that. But I know whom to ask to give special. I'll give special sometime later...
[Shri Mataji proceeds to give out gifts with personal comments for each person, including one for the speaker, Grazyna.]
Now, this is for Grazyna, who has not yet invited me to her house, and I hope she will invite me sometime. Though if I may go, may not go, I don't know. But still, I would say that this is for... I hope that she will invite me to her house. May God bless you. This is the thing, again, with the bowl and these plates.

Grazyna: I'll tell you what happened with that video. There are only two more people after that, Gavin and Chris Clark, and then suddenly the whole video gets scrambled. You can't really see what's going on right to the end of the presents, which is a shame. I wonder if maybe one day our computer whiz kids could do something about that video. But the whole evening was just like that. She was laughing all the time. Every present had some funny comment about it. You could see Patricia Polder there, Charles Churchill was there. We were all young girls. Some of us remember the old days because we were there. Antoinette, you were there also.

Antoinette: I don't think I was there. I came to Chesham Road for a puja at that time, a bit later, with Shri Mataji there. I do remember that. And I felt that the walls were actually elastic because there were so many people in that room. I couldn't understand how it could hold so many people. The meditation room is not that big.

Grazyna: I don't know how many of us used to sit in that room. It was always like this with Shri Mataji. It was a different dimension to everything.

Felicity: It was very nice that you showed this, Grazyna, because so often people don't realize—we just watch Mother's talks and public programs, and you don't get to see this very human, very beautiful, generous, laughing side. Shri Mataji would make jokes all the time, laugh at things. And she had such a command and control over the whole atmosphere and our moods and emotions. She could just change the mood of the room just like that with a funny joke. It was so always correct according to the person.

Grazyna: I still have the plates, and I still welcome everybody to my house and serve them meals on those plates.

Antoinette: It's important to understand how the symbolism of the presents... whenever Shri Mataji gave you a present, there was always a much deeper meaning behind it. One I remember so vividly was at the Guru Nanak Puja, I think it was 1980 or '81, in Hampstead at the Old Temple of All Faiths. After this puja, Shri Mataji suddenly said, "Oh, it's time for the gifts now." The young men brought in boxes of gifts, and each gift was in a brown paper bag, so you couldn't see what it was. Shri Mataji would literally just pick out one of these bags and say, "Oh, this is for Patti. This is for so-and-so." And that person would come up, get the gift, go back to their place, and open the bag. And each person would just kind of go, "Oh, wow." Each gift touched them in some special place. One lady, it was a bottle of perfume, and she said, "Oh, this is because Mother is telling me that I must respect and love myself." It was just incredible to see how Shri Mataji knew which bag was for whom. It was very sweet. But that was such a huge part of Shri Mataji, the generosity. This became a tradition that after big pujas, she would always... so much of the puja money that was collected went to buying presents for all the hosting countries and the people who were hosting. Shri Mataji really showed us how to be generous. How to be gracious, how to be a Lakshmi. It was very beautiful.

Antoinette: I also have stories about perfume because you triggered this memory. We were in Chesham Road with my family for two years. One day, there were little problems in the ashram, as sometimes happens in collective life. Shri Mataji knew, so she called me at the ashram on the phone, which was on the wall on the ground floor. She said, "Hello, Antoinette, this is Shri Mataji here." And I said, "Oh my God, Shri Mataji." She said, "I want to see you. Come and see me at my place." She was living then in an apartment near Victoria.

I remember rummaging in my cupboard to match my tights to my skirt to look really nice in front of Shri Mataji. I had a nice navy blue three-quarter skirt, which was very elegant, and a top that was so elegant. But I took a little bit of time, and then I thought, "Oh my God, I don't want to be late." I ran to the tube station. I was a little bit out of breath arriving there. The servant opened the door, and I was shown into the living room and sat down. Shri Mataji came in, and I was a bit short of breath and so thirsty from walking fast. Shri Mataji looked at me with a smile and said, "You don't need to match your tights to your skirt before coming to see me. Better to have time to do a foot soak." And she laughed, and we laughed.

At that point, I knew she knew everything. I didn't even need to tell her the story of what was happening. And very sweetly, she said, "See, Antoinette, when there's a situation, I let it develop and grow. And then, like a wave crashing onto the shore, I come forcefully with my vibrations." So there it was. You just need to witness, and then she sorts everything out. Then she invited my husband and me for dinner with her in her dining room. I still remember some delicious mango was served. She talked to us very sweetly and kindly. And then she gave us a little red box with four Indian perfumes in it. And I still have them. One is khus, the green perfume for Shri Ganesha, and the other one is honeysuckle. The other day, I put some of the honeysuckle on her photograph, and the whiff of this perfume was wonderful. So yeah, that's one of the stories of Chesham Road.

Host: That was beautiful, Antoinette, and well worth listening to. It's now five to nine, so I suggest that we bring this to a close now. Antoinette, we look forward to hearing some more stories about Chesham Road in January, hopefully. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. Thank you.
