Okay. Thank you very much, Lewis. Thank you very much, Carol. Thank you very much for joining us for this session this morning about San Diego Golden Memories. So let's start with Lewis. Could you tell us about how you met Shri Mataji? Where was it and when was it? What was it like? Please.

That was quite a dramatic situation for me to meet Shri Mataji. She came to Portugal in 1980, but she came mostly for the wedding of Maria Emelia and Arnolda Calbermatten. They got married in Portugal and Shri Mataji was invited. So she came and gave a program, no doubt, but she also went to the wedding. They took some photographs of Shri Mataji during that wedding, and then in Lisbon, somehow, the photographer put the photograph of Shri Mataji in the shop window of his photographic studio.

I was so lucky that I had to go and sit outside that shop for a long, long time, without having any knowledge that this was Shri Mataji or that she was a great guru. I didn't know anything. So this was one of the great coincidences that happened for me. Although I missed Shri Mataji's arrival in Portugal—somehow I never heard of it—life brought me to sit next to that photograph of Mother.

I had to go and visit a lawyer. Before I was doing a law course, before the oral and written exams, we used to go to a certain lawyer who used to be a teacher of law. He used to give us some help and prepare us for the exam, give us some kind of a great lesson and instructions. But he was very busy with important clients, and we had to sit outside waiting for him to call us when he was free. So we were sitting outside, in front of that shop in which there was Shri Mataji's photograph. And Shri Mataji's photograph was in the middle of the shop, as if she were the most important person that photographer had ever photographed.

There was nothing else to look at, so we were there waiting, looking at Mother's photograph, not having a clue who this lady was. And this was helping our exams a lot. We thought it was because this lawyer was so amazing, but now, in retrospect, we understand that getting this Darshan of Mother's photograph was very, very good for our exams. We always wanted to go and see that lawyer before our exams, thinking it was the lawyer who was a genius.

This lawyer was married to a lady from Goa, an Indian lady who also had the red mark on her forehead. And this colleague of mine who was there with us, she used to say, "Look, look at this lady, look at the dot on the forehead. Very important. Look at the dot." The photo was black and white, so the dot was not red. She used to say, "Because when you see my aunt, this dot is red, and you are going to stare at it. Then you are going to talk about it and ask her, 'What is this? Is it blood?' And she gets so upset, she'll throw us out. So here is a good case. Look at this lady here. Look at the dot. You are acquainted with it. When you see her, don't even stare at the dot, otherwise she'll throw us out."

This was happening to us for over two years. I was going through this ritual for two years. We were sitting there looking at Mother's photograph ever so often, for a long time. Sometimes we had to wait an hour before the lawyer was free to see us. He had important clients, and there was nothing else to look at. We were looking at Mother's photo, and it was helping our exams a lot, but we had no idea.

It's a small coincidence. Another small coincidence is that there were only two Sahaja Yogis in Portugal, and I knew them both. But they decided I was not the right person to introduce to Sahaja Yoga. They never told me about it. So still, how was I going to meet Shri Mataji, or to find out who she is, or that she even exists? But Mother has ways. If you are a seeker of truth, Mother finds a way to bring you there. Shri Mataji confirmed this; she said we are all born realized souls—my family, my parents, my sisters, myself. And we were all seeking, no doubt.

But suddenly, my mom started going to certain groups where they had very strange ideas about Christ. And I felt this was so bad for me to hear those things from my mom that I said, "Mom, in the future, we don't ever speak about spirituality, because I'm afraid I don't want to lose my faith in Christ by listening to certain things like this." So that was a risk. As it happens, my mom was the first person, along with my father, to meet Shri Mataji. Not me. And we had this deal between us that we don't talk about spirituality anymore.

I was 22 then. This was in 1982. That was the next time Shri Mataji came to Portugal, and that's when I met her. But there were these barriers, these obstacles for me to meet Shri Mataji. I had this deal, this agreement with my mom, that we don't speak about spirituality ever again. And any group she goes to attend, I don't want to go. I felt she was meeting certain groups that were at a very, very bad level, not really correct. I was also meeting lots of wrong gurus myself, even worse ones than my mom, but I thought mine were better. So we had this agreement.

So when my mom met Shri Mataji, this was like a breach of our agreement. Another agreement I had with my parents is that I will never go to jail to meet my cousin. I was studying law, and I didn't want to mix with criminals. My parents were appalled. "This is your family, this is your cousin. How can you not visit your cousin? He's going to offend your aunt very much, who loves you so much. How can you do that? We have a family duty and a Christian duty also." And I said, "No, no." I was like a fanatic. "We must never mix with criminals." My aunt is my father's sister. So, I was never going to go to jail. My parents started going to meet my cousin in secret, without telling me.

This was a huge problem now, because my mom was reluctant to talk to me about Sahaja Yoga. She and my father were going to meet Shri Mataji again, having met her just the night before. But they were going to the jail first to meet my cousin. So how could they bring me? We couldn't even talk about this.

But somehow, Mother made a miracle. This is the greatest miracle. When they came back, having seen Shri Mataji, they arrived home very late. It was about 3 a.m. My mom went into my bedroom, opened the door, put the light on, and put the photo of Shri Mataji on my face. She told me, "This is the lady you've been looking for all your life." I was so afraid. I said, "No, please take this photograph out of this room. Otherwise, I can't sleep. I'll be afraid of ghosts or something like that." But my mom doesn't take instructions from me. She put it on the shelves there in my bedroom. And that night, for the first time, I slept like I was in paradise.

And Jesus Christ appeared in my dream. Now, this had never happened to me. I had been praying to Christ and the Virgin Mary all my life. We were Catholics, I was always reading the Bible, and Christ never, ever appeared in my dreams. The Virgin Mary had appeared in my dreams, but not Christ. So for the first time, Christ appeared in my dream. I didn't see him, but he talked. This is the Maya, how I managed to see Mother. I had all these obstacles. I knew the people, but they didn't tell me about Sahaja Yoga. I had seen Mother's photo but didn't know it was her. My mom didn't want to speak to me about spirituality anymore. But after meeting Shri Mataji, my mom felt, "Okay, I'm going to tell him this."

So in the dream, Christ appeared and he said these words from the gospel: "I was hungry, and you gave me no food. I was thirsty, you gave me no water. I had no clothes, you gave me no clothes. I was ill, you never came to visit me. I was in jail, and you never came to visit me either." This is the words in the gospel Christ is saying to the disciples. And the disciples replied to Christ, saying, "Oh no, Master or Rabbi, we never did that to you." And Christ replies, "Yes, every time you do this to others, you are doing it to me." That philosophy of Christ's oneness—you do it even to children, you are doing it to me. Whatever you do to the slightest, least important person on earth, you are doing it to me.

So with these words of Christ in my dream, I was thinking, "I'm going to say the same thing as the disciples to Christ. What has this got to do with me? I never did this to Christ." And then I thought about it, and I couldn't get the words out of my mind. Suddenly I realized, "Oh my God, this applies to me." I refused to go and see my cousin in jail. So that day I told my parents, "I need to go and see my cousin in jail now, today." And my parents said, "Well, you are going to go in any case, except we hadn't told you because you get upset with us. And on the way back, you are going to see that lady, the lady Mataji."

And that's how it happened. I really wanted to go and see my cousin in jail because I got that message from Christ in my dream. This happened after seeing Mataji's photograph in the night because my mom put the photograph to my face. And on the way back from jail, we went to see Shri Mataji.

In fact, when I saw Shri Mataji, one of the first things she told me was, "Go and see your cousin in jail." I was really shocked. How can Mother know about this? In fact, Shri Mataji even knew that I don't usually go and see my cousin in jail. But luckily for me, I could say, "Today, for the first time, I've been to see him in jail." And Mother said, "Right, go back again. And this time, raise his Kundalini. Raise his Kundalini." Wow. It was frightening to see how Mother knew everything about my life and all the small details. She even knew that I must go to jail again to meet my cousin and raise his Kundalini. And that's how it happened. I met Shri Mataji at long last.

And what an experience. I had so many problems in life at that time, and Mother started working on all of them. One very serious problem I had was with a girlfriend. I had been with her for two years, and I wanted to get rid of her, but that was very dangerous. In Portugal, sometimes if you have been going out with a girl for two years, you are supposed to marry her. She was a member of a political party, and her brother was a very prominent person in that party. It was a very aggressive political party where they put bombs under the cars of people and even killed people. Many members of the party had been taken to jail for criminal acts of violence. Very dangerous people. Her father was also quite dangerous. So I was afraid to terminate the relationship with her, because of fear of the family. I was afraid to go and tell her parents that I wanted to put an end to this.

To me, it was a serious problem, this girlfriend issue, because she was an atheist and she wanted to convert me to communism. I was, of course, a very religious person. For me, life without God, without religion, is impossible. So it was such a bad relationship where she's trying to convert me, and I'm trying to convert her, and all we do is fight. It was not going to be a successful marriage. I wanted to discuss this matter with her family to see what the solution was. Either she converts to my religion, which is the religion of God—because I will never convert to communism or any philosophy without God—or we may have to split. But I didn't have the courage to face them. I was afraid they might kill me or break my legs.

Somehow, Shri Mataji saw this girl, who was sitting next to me. I had brought her that day by force, against her will. She didn't want to come. Immediately, Mother said, "Who is this girl? What is she doing here?" Of course, because she was an atheist. Mother knew she should not be here, because she doesn't even believe in God. Then I had to confess, "Well, Mother, she's here because I brought her. She's my girlfriend."

And then Mother goes straight to the point. She asked me the question, "Do you love her?" Of course, I didn't. All we did was fight, and I wanted to get rid of her. I was just afraid to face the music with her parents and brothers. Mother asked me the question. I didn't have an answer. She asked me a second time, "Do you love her or not?" No answer. I was just, as if I couldn't speak. Then Mother asked me a third time, "Do you love her or not? I've asked you a question." And the answer came, the truth: "No, I don't love her at all."

Mother was like, "What? You don't even love her? So what is this? This is very indecent. It's not the way to treat a lady. If you don't love her, stop the relationship immediately. Or if you love her, marry her. This is not the proper way to do things." So Mother gave me that courage. I had to go and speak to her family.

It was a dangerous thing to do. But five days after meeting Mother, I went to meet her family. I felt inspired. I'm going to do what she told me to do. I spoke to her family and started saying, "This girl will have to convert to my religion. There's no way I will ever convert. This wedding will never work." I was preparing the grounds for us to stop. And she says, "By the way, I will never marry you. You are a horrible person to me." And I said, "Oh, my God, that's it." How easy.

The interview was over. She refused to marry me for being such a horrible person and refusing to convert to the right philosophy of communism and all that. I was so afraid to face the music with the family, and she herself terminated it for me at long last. Mother solved what was for me a great problem. I was afraid for my life in case I dumped her and the family felt offended. So everything went okay. Mother was already working on my inner problems, my fears, and gave me the courage to do the right thing and have the right behavior. It was an extraordinary thing to meet Mother.

Then Mother gave me self-realization. She asked me to translate because she was working on other people. And at that time, I remember saying, "Thank you, Mr. Blake. Thank you, Mr. William Blake." I felt it was such a privilege to be allowed to sit next to Shri Mataji, at a very small distance of about 10 centimeters, while Mother was working on new people. People who had met Mother on previous occasions had come, and Mother was talking to them and she asked me to translate. I was standing so close to Mother, and I felt the power, the energy, the cool vibrations coming from her. It was something extraordinary. The reason why I had decided to learn English was in order to be able to read the books of William Blake. I was a great admirer of William Blake.

How did you come across William Blake then? Because you were in Portugal. You weren't an English scholar at that point. You were a lawyer, a very ethical and very moral, a very strongly moralistic young person. Where did you come across Blake first?

Yes. I had some friends who were studying philosophy, and they knew about Blake. They also knew I was very interested in the Bible, and so was one of my friends. Because William Blake is a Bible illustrator, he has done some amazing paintings of Christ and the Old Testament. They knew that this would be something I'd like, so they showed me the books. And that's when I decided I have to learn English properly in order to be able to read William Blake because it's so difficult.

So when I met Mother and because I could speak English, I was invited to translate for her. I felt that was such a privilege to sit there next to Mother. I felt such waves of joy and bliss coming from her. It was the most powerful experience. And I said, "Thank you, Mr. William Blake," because that's the reason I learned English. The words just came out of me. So interestingly, William Blake had been there for a while, helping me already then.

Okay, thanks for that, Lewis. Can we address this question to Carol now? Carol, if you could share your journey of how and when and where you were when you first met Mother and what was it like to meet Shri Mataji?

Wonderful to learn from him. It's just made me realize, talking about it this time, that he was seeing Mother's face for the first time in the 1980s. And I think in 1980, I was starting to be conscious that I needed something. Looking back, I've realized that it's because I actually saw a poster of Mother on a shop window. It was one where Mother's got her hair all out like this, quite a dramatic photo which was used on that poster. It was just a sort of photocopied black and white print, not like we do nowadays.

I had been brought up in a very Christian missionary family. My parents were missionaries in India, and I was born in India, which was a great privilege for me. There's a bit of a story about that which I'll come to, which has to do with Mother. So it's interesting to see that Luis was looking at Mother's photo and I, by chance, had seen Mother's photo. I just needed time to get myself a bit away from the church—I'm not saying Christianity, but the church. I'd stopped going, but I knew there was a gap in my life. I was having a lot of emotional problems.

I was doing my second degree, a master's in landscape architecture. It was very hard work. I'd had lots of quite intense relationships where people asked me to marry them, and I either said no because I just somehow knew they weren't the right person. Finally, I said yes, because I thought they seemed to be the right person, but my heart, something always told me, "This is not right for you," and I always had to back out. I felt so bad about that. I was saying to myself, because I hadn't met Mother, "How can I do this to somebody? This is so appalling. I feel so ashamed of myself." Now, in retrospect, I think this sort of seeking and looking inside myself had come from seeing Mother's photograph. As Luis has said, the photograph started working on the things which would stop us from coming to Sahaja Yoga if Mother hadn't done that for us.

I started reading books that I'd never read before. I started skipping out of my job to go and look for books, and I found one book which said, "What you need is a guru." I thought, "Yes, I need a guru." Also, I had been reading the Bible again and Christ's parables. I thought, "I'll read it myself, for myself. Nobody telling me what I should think about it." And Christ says in that... well, it's to do with him sending a comforter. There's going to be something else. I started thinking, "Gosh, I've recognized Christ at that time. Will I recognize him if he comes again?"

It really came to a head. I was just so distraught. I tried going back to the church, I tried other things. I went into a church just because I needed something. There was a statue of the Virgin Mary there, and I just started crying. It was a Catholic church, because my family is Protestant. It's just when you look back like this, it's such a privilege because it makes you start to think how much Mother's been there all the time. But seeing this statue of the Virgin Mary, I just sort of opened my heart and just cried.

Sometime after that, a friend of mine in a shared house I was living in said, "Oh, Carol, you've been looking at all sorts of things. You should try this. We've just been to this amazing program. You should see what you feel. It's incredible. You must come with us next week." So I went with them the next week, and of course, it was a Sahaja Yoga program. This was in Sheffield.

The things that they were saying at the introduction and then the tape of Mother talking was just amazing. Because I'd been doing this landscape architecture, it's all about planning and thinking. And Mother said, "You don't have to plan anything. God just put a tree there, a river here." I was thinking, "Wow, fantastic." Amazing. And then the two Sahaja Yogis who worked on me to give me my realization, Gail Pottinger and John Glover, were fantastic. They used the candle, they used everything. I started crying, and they said, "It's all right. Don't worry. Your heart's opening." Then they said, "Can you feel it? Can you feel it on your hands? Can you feel it above your head?" I was very scientific as well, lots of mental activity. Then they said, "Well, anything else? What can you feel?" I said, "Oh, I can feel something cool coming down onto my knees." They were almost clapping and saying, "Oh, thank God."

So very quickly, I was absorbed into the Sahaj community in Sheffield. It was great, and they were teaching me everything. The next opportunity to go down to London to meet Shri Mataji, we did.

You were in Sheffield by virtue of studying landscape architecture. And what was your first degree in?

Botany and zoology. I did that in London at King's College. But somehow, Mother kept me on that track because I think that was auspicious to have, and also that it was something that I could work at through my life, which I did.

In fact, when Mother phoned up to arrange our wedding—sorry, I'm jumping all over the place—she said to me, "Both of you, you've got this similar education. He's come from a very good family with a lot of education, and you come from a family with education. Your education level is sort of similar. I think that will be a good idea." And it was true. Luis had done a six-year law degree in Portugal. Mother told me that he was a scholar and that I should help him to continue in a scholarly way. She said he had studied law for six years because he wanted to get to the truth. Mother told him in London, eventually, "No, you shouldn't do law here because it's completely corrupt." Luis was surprised because he thought that this was a country which had honour and good things. He couldn't see the corruption. Those things are part of this country, but they have been completely undermined.

So you were so much into progressing your learning and accomplishing things. How did you deal with the thoughtlessness that came with being in Shri Mataji's presence? What was it like?

Yes, well, this is where the next bit of the story about me meeting Mother in person comes in. It was at a puja in Chelsham Road, one of those towards the end of the summer or into early autumn. I went to two or three of them in quite quick succession. At the first one, after the puja was finished, we were invited to go up to Mother's feet.

All through the puja, in Mother's talk, I was looking at Mother. She used to sit next to the fireplace, and I was on the back wall, directly in front of her but some distance away. I kept thinking, "Who are you?" And I asked this when I went to the Sheffield program, "Who is this lady?" And when I got home, I thought, "I know who you are." The next time I went to puja, I went to Mother's feet, and there was some conversation then as well. When I came back, I felt, "Well, I just love you, Mother."

There wasn't a question for me about thinking about any of that. I had already used some rationalization. I had been to a meeting where Ray Harris's mother, Mrs. Harris, had said that Shri Mataji is a reincarnation of the Virgin Mary. And I'd sort of thought to myself, "Well, that's possible." I was being quite scientific about those things, but it didn't hamper me at that time. That kind of magnet of Shri Mataji, because of who she is, drew everyone to her.

Actually, for my first job, I wore a sari to work. This was in 1983. Mother did realize this; she did keep on asking me, "Where are you from?" And I'd say, "I was born in India. I was born in India. I was born in India." And it's like, "Sheffield, Mother." I knew in my heart what she wanted me to tell her. It wasn't until I went on the India tour in '82-'83 that she again asked me. In fact, this was about when I went to her feet because somebody suggested I should put myself on the wedding list. She said, "Where are you from?" And I said, "Mother, I was born in India." She said, "Ha! I knew. I knew. I could see it on your face." It's been a real benefit for me, so I have to say that I'm privileged and lucky for Mother's grace that I was born in India because it helped to overcome some of this Englishness.

Do you remember any humorous incidents?

Well, I come from a family where we don't laugh at all. My father was of the opinion one should not laugh; it's not polite. In fact, he had a friend, his best friend, who did not know how to laugh. This is a very rare thing to find in life, a person who doesn't know how to laugh. If you don't learn how to laugh by the age of five or six, you can never learn later in life. This poor man, in his youth, there was war in Africa and he was there as a child. He saw such horrible things and had such a difficult life that he missed out on learning how to laugh. So it was my father's best friend, and they used to go and see some political comedies hoping he would somehow learn. You can see, his best friend couldn't laugh, and my father thought laughing is very rude.

So I lived many years under that regime. Then one day, I was at Mother's house in Brompton Square and I couldn't stop laughing. I started laughing, laughing, laughing, laughing non-stop, and everybody was looking at me like this guy must be having a possession or a fit. So I just had to leave Mother's room and go outside and wait for all the laughing to stop. It was absolute bliss; I couldn't stop laughing. Then I came back to Mother's room, and soon afterwards, it started again. This went on for a couple of days, and Mother never said a word about it, as if she knew what was going on. If the laughing attack came, I would just get out of the room very fast so as not to disturb anybody. For three or four days, all the laughing that had been repressed came out. I have never laughed so much in my life.

And with Mother, there were small little incidents and mistakes that would make us laugh a lot. I think one time we all laughed a lot was when we arrived at Mother's house at Brompton Square and Mother was jumping on the spot. Can you imagine Mother at her age, jumping up and down on the stairs, on the floor? Jumping, really, in the sitting room. It's unbelievable to imagine. The two yogis around her started doing the same. So I arrived there, and I'm looking from the door, and I must have looked terrible, really astounded. What on earth is this? I've never seen a thing like this. At their faces, Mother and they stopped the jumping, and they laughed and laughed and laughed. We couldn't stop laughing.

The situation was that these two yogis had been doing building work and carpentry on Mother's floorboards because there were some creaks. They had been trying to eliminate all those noises. They asked Mother, "Mother, do you want to test it?" So Mother tested it by jumping on some floorboards that used to be noisy, to say, "Yes, it's fine now." Then she said, "Let's test the whole room." Then Mother said, "Luis can come and join," and so I joined in the jumping. Suddenly, there were three of us jumping. Mother was still jumping a little bit, and we looked at each other. It was an extraordinary situation. We just went down laughing, laughing, laughing. It was something unheard of for me. But there would always be something that looked strange, but you realized it was absolutely normal and natural. We had asked Mother to test the floorboard, so she jumped a few times. So did the yogis, and so did I in the end. But you couldn't stop laughing.

Were there any sort of treatments given to you both?

Yes, this is related to the William Blake side. Shri Mataji told me to worship Shri Mahakali, to pay particular attention to Shri Mahakali, which means a left-side problem. And if you listen to one of Shri Mataji's Shri Mahakali Puja talks, she explains that William Blake is the greatest disciple and worshiper of Shri Mahakali. So the subjects of Bhairava and Shri Mahakali are very related. After all, Bhairava, which is the same as William Blake, is the greatest disciple of Shri Mahakali.

It's a coincidence that Shri Mataji told Carol that her "only salvation is to worship Shri Mahavira." This is what Mother said to Carol. So it's very similar, because Shri Mahavira, according to Mother, is also Bhairava. Mother gave us the same advice: to work on the Bhairava principle, either Shri Mahakali for me or Mahavira for Carol. Carol used to ask me, "How do I worship Mahavira?" Our answer was always the same: "Very simply, worship Shri Mataji."

In fact, once Shri Mataji told me that William Blake is in her body. That's what she told me. And when she said that, she put her hands on her stomach, her void, and she slapped it with both hands when she said, "William Blake is in my body." Mother went for the void because the void is the place of the Guru, and Shri Mataji has also explained in her talks that William Blake represents the disciple principle. The disciple has to be with the Guru, so he has to be also in that area of the void. She was pointing out the area of the Guru, the void where he is. After all, he is the disciple; he represents the disciple principle. So this makes sense.

I was going to tell a little story about my memories of Shri Mataji and William Blake. It all started because she wanted to tell me to write to her. "Write me a letter." So I wrote a newsletter giving the news of Portugal, what was happening. In that newsletter, I went to my Blake books, and I cut some paintings out of the books. It was a big sacrifice. I cut the paintings of Blake and stuck them onto that handwritten newsletter for Shri Mataji about what we were doing in Portugal. Because I put those two paintings of William Blake, I had to say something about them related to Sahaja Yoga. When I met Mother in person, she told me she liked that very much, the little thing I had written about Blake and his paintings. And she advised me to write about Sahaja Yoga.

I felt, "All right, I'm going to write another newsletter." By then, I had come to live in England, and I was living in Liverpool. I wrote another newsletter and sent one to Mother. This time again, from my Blake books, I cut a little engraving by Blake and put it on that newsletter, with a little thing about Mahavira. The next time I met Mother, she told me again, "I liked it very much that you put something about William Blake and Mahavira. You should write more about Sahaja Yoga."

But by then, I was doing Mother's transcripts. Almost every day I was transcribing Mother's talks, so I told Mother, "I'm already doing that because I'm transcribing your talks. I'm writing about Sahaja Yoga." And she said, "That's not what I mean. That's important, but that's different. To write about William Blake, to write about Sahaja Yoga, is not the same as transcribing my talks."

She reminded me several times to write about Sahaja Yoga, and I used to tell her, "There's nothing I can say about Sahaja Yoga, Mother. You have said everything. It's all in your talks. I actually worship your talks. I transcribe them daily and learn from them. How can I say something about Sahaja Yoga?" But Mother insisted, "No, no, write something about Sahaja Yoga. You can write more."

Much later, Shri Mataji told me again, "So have you started writing about Sahaja Yoga?" I said, "No, Mother, I can't. I don't know what to say. I have nothing to say." And she said, "All right, just write your own testimonial, your experiences in Sahaja Yoga, because I need that for a newspaper in India." There had been a little bit of opposition to Sahaja Yoga in Maharashtra, and some horrible people threw stones at the Sahaja Yogis there at one time. Mother wanted to put a few articles out in the Maharashtrian newspapers with testimonials from the yogis from abroad. So she told me, "Write your testimonial."

And again, I thought, "How can I do that, Mother? It's such a responsibility. I don't know how to write my testimonial. Can you give me some tips or some pointers, some direction, some suggestions?" And she dictated my testimony. She wrote my own testimonial, all of it. I said, "Mother, do you mind stopping? I need to get a paper. I need to write this down." She said, "No, no, no, you can do it. We can write it." It was late in the night already. She said, "Have a nice sleep, and then next day you can write it." "By then I'll forget it!" But Mother dictated my whole testimonial. She didn't allow me to write it down. The idea was that I should write it the next day, and it felt to me like a miracle. I was able to write it in the end and to put it in my own words. So Mother was somehow encouraging me to write about Sahaja Yoga, and I was feeling a great lack of confidence.

There was another occasion. The message was for me to go and see Shri Mataji, but they only told me to go, not what for. It was Good Friday. Mother was a little bit more serious than usual because this is the day when Christ was crucified. Mother was going into meditation, and then she started dictating and dictating. I didn't know what she was dictating. Maybe half an hour later, Mother says to me, "Do you mind reading back the last paragraph?" That's when I realized I should have been writing it down. "Oh my God." "Didn't they tell you you were coming to write down what I'm dictating?" "No, they just told me to come. They didn't say what for. I didn't bring paper or pen, nothing." Mother said, "Don't worry, it's fine. You can write it down now." How was I going to write what Mother had said? She was giving a tremendous speech about Christ, because it was Good Friday, and now I had to write this down.

We managed to get some paper and a pen at Mother's house. There was another yogi there who had arrived just a few minutes before. Mother went into meditation, and the whole thing flew. I was able to write down everything. I could feel how Mother was helping me to get some confidence that yes, we can write about Sahaja Yoga.

Just curious to know where one could access these testimonials and what she told you about Christ on that Good Friday?

Yes, that was sent to the newspapers. It was a letter Mother was dictating for the editors of the newspapers in the UK because there was a film about Christ which was very offensive, a very indecent film where they were suggesting that Christ had an affair with Mary Magdalene. Mother said this is such an insult. Christ is a man of the highest dharma. He could not have an affair with a woman, because that's like adultery. It's something very adharmic. Mother was explaining this to the editors of the newspapers so they should not publicize that film.

That letter was corrected and went through many edits before it was sent. This was in a way Mother boosting my self-confidence and helping me write about Sahaja Yoga. Then at Shudy Camps, I was reading a book written by a horrible false guru, and he criticized Mother twice in that book. I had underlined that in red, so I showed it to her. "Do you know about this false guru?" "Yes, yes." Mother knew about him. She looked at the book—it was horrible—and then she told me, "You see, you've been asking me what you should write about Sahaja Yoga. A subject you know. What you can do is to write about William Blake. This man is a rationalist, a scientist, and he does not believe in faith in God; he calls it superstition. And these Marathi people that attacked the Sahaja Yogis with stones, they are disciples of this man whose book you are reading. Since William Blake really didn't like people like this who were very rational, who didn't have faith in God, who didn't believe in any divine revelation but just believed in science and nothing else, and Blake spent his whole life opposing this wrong philosophy... So you were asking me what's the subject, what can you say about Sahaja Yoga. I advise you to write about William Blake and Sahaja Yoga, the two together." So that's how it started.

So right from your first interest back in Portugal as a student, your interest in William Blake, and when you thanked Mr. Blake for giving you the opportunity to translate Shri Mataji's talks... that was your initial journey with Blake. What inspired you to work on the "Glimpses of Sahaja Yoga in the Paintings of William Blake"?

I'm going to hand over this to Carol, because Carol also spent a long time working on this subject with me. This came from a lecture Shri Mataji gave us about William Blake at her house. I'm going to ask her to tell this part of the story.

(Carol) Yes, it was at the time when Luis was going to Brompton Square to help with the work there. They quite often had a rest during the periods of work where Mother might ask them into her room, and everybody would be delighted. Luis and a French Sahaja Yogi were already there waiting, and they saw a book on the coffee table. The French Sahaja Yogi saw this book and said, "Oh, Shri Mataji, this book is William Blake. Have a look at it, please." And Mother said, "What a good idea, what a good idea. But let's wait for everybody else to come, and then we can all enjoy it."

When everybody else arrived, there was a group of Sahaja Yogis who had been working. Mother picked up the book and started looking through the pages. At first, they were just seeing Mother's face as she was looking at the pictures of Blake, looking really closely and going, "Wah, wah, wah," and she herself was just so enjoying seeing them. Then finally, she started turning the pictures around and showing them to everyone, saying, "You can see here, look, these are the three channels. Look at this picture. See here, they've got their hand on the Sahasrara." Mother started pointing out these motifs, and Luis, I think you can take it from here.

Remind us of the year. What year was it? We're talking about Brompton Square, the vibrations are still so beautifully strong there.

(Lewis) '84, I think. Yes, I believe it was '84 when she gave that master lecture. Mother gave about an hour and a half... a very long session. Mother explained so many things.

Then one day, much later on—this is when Shri Mataji was no longer talking that much, maybe 2005 onwards—a message came. The UK recollections book was being done, and the first draft was being read to Mother by her family and the yogis living there. They were not sure if Mother was paying attention or if she was deep in meditation. By the time they read the whole draft to the end, Shri Mataji said the names of the yogis who had not given testimonials. So yes, she was in meditation, but she could do so many things at the same time. She gave a huge list of names of people who did not contribute.

And then she said something even more extraordinary: "What about the things I've been saying about William Blake to Sahaja Yogis?" I was one of those culprits. I had not yet shared everything Mother told me about William Blake because she said so many things, and some are hard to explain. The message came: Shri Mataji is talking about what she said about William Blake; we have to share those things also. I had shared a few, but not all. This particular one about the glimpses of Sahaja Yoga motifs in William Blake's paintings, we had not shared that yet.

That's when Carol and I started working on it, started doing the research. We felt the easiest way would be to do a slideshow. So we did that at Chelsham Road. This is what came out of that great lesson Mother gave with the book of William Blake, explaining to all of us the motifs. We decided to share that lesson by finding examples of those things Mother was explaining.

(Carol) What we found out when we started doing the "Glimpses" was that you could really feel the effect that Blake's paintings had on oneself when you were working with them for some time. There are people who come and say a particular picture just really speaks to them, it really did something to them, it really worked on a particular chakra, it solved a particular problem.

(Lewis) Yes, we were at Chelsham Road, and the message came: "Mother's going to go to the Tate gallery now to see William Blake's paintings. Those who are free and want to go, let's go." I said straight away, "Carol, we're going to be late, there's no time," because the message reached us very late. It takes so long to put the baby in a pochette, dress him, spare clothes, bottles... and Carol was still in her pajamas. I said, "You can't come, I'll go alone and I'll tell you all about it."

So we went there, and Mother didn't speak that much because the place was so full of people. But she did something else even more interesting. To each and every painting of William Blake, because she could not do a speech, she put her hands towards the paintings like this and she said, "Tremendous vibrations. Tremendous vibrations. Can you feel the vibrations of these paintings?" There were not many Sahaja Yogis who managed to be there on time, just a few of us, three or four. One of us next to Mother on each side was also checking the vibrations at the same time. The vibrations were just like a bath of cool vibrations from each and every painting. The thing Mother said the most was, "Tremendous vibrations. Amazing vibrations. This is terrific. Can you feel this?" And yes, we all felt it. It was incredible. We have never had an experience so strong of feeling vibrations like this.

At the end of the exhibition, there was a glass cabinet, and inside at the bottom were very tiny engravings of William Blake in black and white, about this big. To see them was impossible inside the glass cabinet, and Mother was putting her head virtually on top of the glass to see those engravings that were almost a meter down. She was saying, "These are amazing, tremendous vibrations." We were not so impressed; you could hardly see them, let alone understand them. Mother said, "Tremendous vibrations. Can you check this?" And we checked and were like, "Wow, that is incredible. How can Mother even see this?"

Later on, we looked into some Blake books and at last we found a book that tells us the poem that Blake is illustrating. It's not the actual words from Virgil; it's another English poet that translated that from Latin into English, and this is the text that Blake is illustrating. When you look at that story, you realize it is indeed about Sahaja Yoga. It's about a guru-disciple relationship, how the guru removes all the problems of the disciple. This was a disciple suffering from left-side problems, and the guru has to arrive and remove all his problems until he's in such a state of joy that he starts writing poetry in praise of the divine. In the end, this disciple erupts into song, into bhajans. This is clearly a story very relevant to Sahaja Yoga, and Mother is an expert in William Blake. Other scholars have pointed out that this was Blake's most influential work in his lifetime.

And you have the mask of William Blake, don't you?

(Carol) Yes, we were living in Wales at this time, around '85 or '86. Mother had sent us there so that Luis could study at the University of Wales in Cardiff to do a master's law degree in international marine law. We thought it would be good to see Mother and maybe give her something. We went to the National Portrait Gallery to see Blake's portrait, and at that time, in front of the portrait, they used to display a bronze of Blake's head. In the gallery shop, they had plaster copies of this head of Blake. At that time, it was painted black. We bought one of these to give to Mother, but we weren't sure whether she would like it or not, because at the time we thought it was a death mask.

There was this big event where Amjad Ali Khan was playing at the Commonwealth Institute in London. Mother was going to be there with a lot of important diplomatic people and her family. We had the box with us with the mask inside. At the interval, we thought, "Now's our chance." Luis had the box in his hand and started taking the mask out of the box a bit. It's not really a mask as such; it's a whole head sculpture. From quite a long distance away, Mother suddenly, although she was talking to these dignitaries, turned around and she said, "Look, he's in meditation! Look, he's meditating!"

(Lewis) As I remember, I took the lid out of the box and was preparing to take the whole head out. But as soon as I took the lid off, she turned around, although she was talking to those dignitaries, and she pointed at the statue. All you could see was the Sahasrara of William Blake; the head was still inside the box. From that distance, Mother pointed and said, "Isn't he beautiful? He is in meditation." Just from seeing the top of the head, Mother knew who it was, what it was, everything. You see, he was not dead. The scholars have researched this incident; according to them, William Blake fell asleep during the taking of the mask. Mother is correcting it. He did not fall asleep; he is actually in meditation. So Mother added a little extra knowledge to this incident.

Then, when Mother was going to the car, we asked her, "Mother, do you like that?" She said, "Yes, yes, it's all right." So that box went into Mother's car. Later, at Shudy Camps, maybe two years later, that box appeared again. We were packing Mother's stuff, and Mother looked at me and continued the conversation from two years back. She was like this; she could continue a conversation two days later. "So, you were asking me whether I like this. To tell you the truth, I do like it, but I wish they did not make it black. It could have been a lighter color, not so dark." After Mother said that, we went back to the museum, and to our surprise, they had started doing them in natural skin tones, not black anymore. It seemed like a miracle to us, as if the artists could hear what Mother was saying in the unconscious.

So how did you two actually find the location of the grave of William Blake? Could you tell us the details of it and how you went about proving it to the City of London and the Blake scholars?

(Carol) Well, the idea of marking the grave of William Blake is not an original idea of ours. We had heard Mother saying this in her talks several times, that she had advised some of the early English Sahaja Yogis to go there and pay respects to the grave of William Blake. I found one talk where Mother talks about it. She even gave the postcode of the graveyard for the Sahaja Yogis to go there.

Can you read what Mother said?

(Carol) Yes. This is from the 22nd of November, 1984, from a talk at Friends Meeting House in Hampstead. Mother said: "England has to become Jerusalem as promised by William Blake. But how many have any regard for William Blake? I was amazed. I wanted to find his burial place, where he was buried, and what was the tomb they erected for him. And in a forlorn place, in EC1, in a most neglected place, he is laid down there. Just neglected. It's so sad. He thought of England to be Jerusalem one day. The holiest of holy is laid down there, neglected, and everybody walking on his tomb. Nobody is respecting him... But if William Blake had died in India, I can tell you this much, there would have been thousands sitting there. Take it from me. Even today, in India, a saint is respected much more than a king and the queen."

(Lewis) It took a long time before we even visited Bunhill Fields. For me, it was a scary thing because before coming to Sahaja Yoga, I used to suffer from fear of ghosts. Shri Mataji had cured that disease in about two or three weeks, but it's a phobia. My instinct was telling me, "I know Mother said we should visit his grave, but just in case these fears come back..." But in the end, there was a little miracle. Carol got a job next door to where Blake is buried. And the boss told them, "Go and eat your sandwiches there in the park where William Blake is buried."

(Carol) At first, I didn't want to tell Luis that's what I'd been doing because I knew he wouldn't think it was the right thing to be eating my sandwiches in the cemetery. But when I talked to him, I told him that when you get there, there's that stone which is near a big obelisk for Daniel Defoe, and it says, "Nearby lie William Blake and his wife, Catherine Sophia Blake." You just think, "Where is that nearby?" Because there's nothing to show where it is. It was so disappointing. I told this to Luis, and he said, "Well, next weekend, let's go and we'll see it together." So that was really the beginning of the whole search.

(Lewis) When we arrived at Blake's grave and we saw "nearby," we thought of the inspiration from Mother finding the swayambu in Portugal on vibrations. She could feel it from kilometers away. We thought, "If Mother is saying that even a tooth of Lord Buddha or some hairs of the Prophet Muhammad can give such strong vibrations, we have all the teeth of William Blake here, we have all his hairs, we have his whole body buried here. Maybe ordinary yogis like me and Carol might be able to feel this on vibrations."

It happened. It was hot in the summer, and we felt as if someone had dropped a bucket of cold water over our heads—bang, a full bath. That's the type of vibrations we felt, not just a little cool breeze. And there was something else we also felt.

(Carol) A fragrance, a wonderful fragrance, which was just around that spot where we were feeling the coolness as well. For me, it smelled a bit like a little yellow flower which grows on a tree in India. Luis, coming from a Catholic background, knows that quite often when there's a saint buried somewhere, they smell a fragrance of roses. This was amazing for us. With my scientific hat on, I went around to check there wasn't an actual plant giving off this smell, but we didn't feel the cool or the fragrance anywhere else. We came back another weekend to make sure, and it was the same.

(Lewis) We were standing there, we checked the vibrations again, and we went back to the same spot. There we are with our hands out, enjoying the vibrations with our eyes closed, both of us lost in this joy. Suddenly a guy taps me on my shoulder from behind and he says, "What on earth are you doing here, standing over the grave of William Blake?" It was like a frightening scene. I walked backwards one meter. This guy is talking like Mother now. I asked him, "How do you know?" And he asked me the same question.

We had to compare stories. We knew because of vibrations. He knew because there was an old man who used to sit on the bench next to the spot. This guy was the caretaker of the cemetery. He asked the old man, "Why do you always sit on this bench?" And the old man said, "Because this is the bench that is the nearest one to the grave of William Blake." This caretaker had an art degree and was crazy about William Blake. The old man knew the location because he used to be in charge of that graveyard many years ago, and he was the one who took the stone of William Blake from the location of the grave to where it is now, next to Defoe's obelisk.

So this caretaker, his name is Robin, he told us, "I have here a book about this cemetery with lots of maps. Take the book home. You do the research. After all, you are a lawyer, and your wife is a landscape architect." Everything was falling into our laps. It took many years of research to be able to do the precise calculations, but we were able to prove it, not just on vibrations but on the actual evidence. We wrote a study about it, and the study was accepted by all the Blake scholars worldwide.

(Carol) We got a call from Dr. Kerry Davis, the secretary of the Blake Society. He sent our study to one of the great Blake scholars in America, Professor G.E. Bentley Jr., who wrote a very kind letter back saying, "I would wish that I had done this research... congratulations." That was how it became recognized by the Blake scholars worldwide.

(Lewis) It took us 12 years to get permission from the City of London to mark the location. The owners of the cemetery told me they would not allow me to mark the location unless I was a member of the Blake Society committee. Mother had told me to go there and help them, but I felt I was not prepared. But out of a small newspaper article about our discovery, we got an invitation to be on the committee of the Blake Society. So when I went back to the City of London, they said, "Right, now you are on the committee of the Blake Society. We can do business with you." It was a long process. There was a local Act of Parliament ordering all grave monuments to be taken away from that lawn. But because I was legally trained, I found some notes at the end of the Act that give powers to the City of London to take administrative decisions on discretion. So nowadays in that whole lawn, there's only one monument. It's the monument of William Blake.

I can see how Shri Mataji, of course, being the Supreme Goddess, knew how you two are a good match and how you just complement each other's skill sets in this project. Our gratitude and congratulations to you both. Tell us your experience as a Sahaj couple. When Shri Mataji matched you and married you, what was it like?

I think there's a little miracle there also. When I was born in Portugal, for many long years, Portugal was trying to keep the African colonies. There was a war, and we were growing up being brainwashed that you have to go and fight in Africa. I was just a kid; I didn't know anything about politics. They used to ask me, "So when you grow up, you want to defend your country, don't you? Do you want to join the Navy, Air Force, or military?" And I used to say, "None of them, because I have to go to London to get married." It was a really absurd thing to say. I used to get slaps on the face. "What a coward! What a traitor! You don't want to defend your country."
