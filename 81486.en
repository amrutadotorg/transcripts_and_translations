Pat and Maureen were talking about sleeping at the place near Harrods. If you want to know what date it was, it was the date that Shri Mataji gave the Bhija mantras. It's recorded; there's a recording of Bhija mantras by Shri Mataji. That is when it was. And it wasn't behind Harrods; it was just off Sloane Square. But that sort of area, not too far from Harrods.

Remember then, we had to carry all that furniture there. We had to do a load of it, and at the end, we were all really exhausted. And Shri Mataji said, "Oh, your vibrations are all flowing really well. Exercise seems to be good for you." I remember thinking, "Uh-oh, that means there's going to be a lot of work ahead." And I wasn't wrong.

If we went to Shri Mataji's house to move furniture, I always referred to it as "dancing with the furniture." Because Mother would say, "Put this... move that over to there. Take that up there. Bring that down here." And then you'd move everything around. You'd be going up and down stairs and in and out of different rooms carrying pieces of furniture. At the end of it, the things would be in more or less the same place as when they started, but your vibrations would be incredible.

Completely detached. You couldn't be at all interested in the outcome; you just had to enjoy doing it. As I say, "dancing with the furniture." That's what I used to call it.

There was no practical application. It was always something... I mean, remember that carpenter's face at Brompton Square when he had just finished building the wall to her bathroom? He'd plastered it, painted it—everything was done. And he stood back and said, "How do you like it?" Shri Mataji looked at it and said, "Yes, I think it's fine. But do you think it could be about a foot over that way?" He had to knock it all down and rebuild it. His face... he couldn't believe it.

Another interesting anecdote: If you look at the tape list for tape, I think it's 198 or 199, which was made at Dollis Hill. Mother was there, and Paul Winter was there. Do you remember what he said after Mother had given a talk? He said to Mother, "Are you God?" And Mother, in so many words—putting it rather more sweetly than I can—said, "Well, of course I am." She said the difference between her and God was like the difference between the sun and its rays, or the sea and its waves. It was quite amazing. We knew who she was, but nobody was really prepared to say it.

You remember Gus? He was my sort of mentor in the hippie scene. He had been around for years and was considered to be quite a big wheel spiritually. That was the time I was with Shri Mataji and I dreamt about seeing him. I was with Shri Mataji going to the meeting the next day when he was actually there—and I had dreamt about it the night before. On the way, we got a whole squad of Grenadier Guards in front of the taxi and somehow got stuck behind it. They were like a guard of honour, which was quite funny.

Anyway, when we got there, this chap was in a really bad way. Absolutely collapsed. And she said to him, "Now, what's the situation?"

God save the king.
