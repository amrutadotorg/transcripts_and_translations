 (England)
We are very pleased to have Christopher Greaves and Ruth today for our Sahaja Yoga Golden Memory session. Chris and Ruth, as we address them here in England, in the heart of the universe, have been instrumental in starting Sahaja Yoga, slaying the seeds and the foundation of Sahaja Yoga in the southwest of England. They're going to talk about how Sahaja Yoga was started and established there, and the process it took.

So if we start with you, Chris. Christopher Greaves is an author; he's written several books and is working on several projects. Ruth, his lovely wife, is an artist. She is a craftsperson; she's very talented with the use of her hands. I'm looking forward to listening to all these stories that you have. Chris, please start off. What was the journey of seeking for you like? When did you meet Shri Mataji first? What was it all about?

Chris: Okay. I was always seeking; that was, I suppose, the fundamental thing in my life, although I didn't necessarily phrase it as, "I am a seeker." I always felt—it can sound egocentric, but it didn't feel like that—that I had some task to do in this life, that I wasn't just here to waste it or do something frivolous or materialistic, but there was some purpose and I had to find it. And I hoped I would.

How I came to Sahaja Yoga, very briefly... well, it's quite an interesting story. I've told it many times, but there was something a little miraculous about it. I was living in Bristol, and I used to take this music paper every week. I was getting to the point where I thought, "Why do I buy this wretched newspaper? I'm not interested really in the kind of music it was about anymore; I've moved on." But in the very last issue that I bought, there was a tiny advertisement in the back, a little picture of Shri Mataji, saying that on the 5th of June—this was in 1978—she would grant on-mass Self-Realization at Caxton Hall, London.

I was more of a thinker rather than someone who feels his way through life, and I figured out that if there was to be some sort of breakthrough, it had to be something that was individual—Self-Realization would describe it—but also somehow collective, so on-mass would describe it. This seemed to absolutely be what I was looking for. But I'm a person who lives very much in his imagination, so I tend to do things in my imagination and then look around, wake up, and realize that I haven't done it at all, except in fantasy. What I'm trying to say is, to get me to go from Bristol to London for this meeting—I was quite a shy person, what was I going to find? and so on—was not a straightforward thing. But it just so happened that some friends were moving to London that very day, so I could get a lift with them. I was just—I was quite young, quite poor, I'd just turned 26 a couple of days before this.

Now, my friends who were going to London were musicians, and two of the people that I shared a flat with played together. A very nice kind of music that was sort of jazzy but with an Indian touch, instrumental, very good. They had been looking for a name. I found that a man who lived in Bristol—he was a seeker, too—suggested the name. He found in a book he had this name "Sahaja," so they called this band Sahaja, and they played around Bristol a few times. But this wasn't mentioned on the advertisement I'd seen.

So we went to London, and they went off to Holland Park where he was moving, and then they were going to go to a jazz gig in the evening. Of course, I was drawn; it's so much easier to just flow along like that rather than to make this effort to go to Caxton Hall. But I went. And outside, there was this big poster saying "Sahaja Yoga," and obviously, this for me was very symbolic. I guess this is it.

I went in, and Shri Mataji was introduced by Gregoire, who gave a very powerful introduction which I haven't heard before or since, saying basically who Shri Mataji was—who she was spiritually. There were also leaflets on the chairs that described her as having been married. I'm a very skeptical person, skeptical about virtually everything, but this absolutely struck a chord with me. I didn't doubt it, and I never doubted it at all. I just felt, "Yes, this is it. This is why I'm on this earth, and this is the Goddess."

Someone took me up at the end. She clipped my neck, told me I should get my hair cut, which was extremely long. She said entities can get in it. So I thought, "Right, I've got to cut my hair." I was looking for an excuse to cut it, really. You know what it's like when you grow your hair...

Interviewer: Style! Remind us again, this is 1978, Caxton Hall, summer probably?

Chris: Yeah, so it was a funny time because this was the time of punk. I remember going to a punk gig in Bristol, and there were a lot of people there. They all had sort of pins through their faces and these kind of plastic clothes with zips everywhere. And they all had short hair, and they looked at me and said, "What are you?"

Also, she actually said, "There's someone very good in Bristol." And I pictured this sort of old man with a white beard, you know, sort of very sage-like. This is how little I knew. And it turned out to be—he's very good, he's still very good—this was Alan Richards, who is in America now. About 21, yeah, he was younger than me. He was a student there, and we met up quite a while later, I think in December or January. But he was quite shy too, so it wasn't that we immediately set about starting meetings, but that happened sometime later.

Interviewer: Tell us about your meeting with Shri Mataji. So Gregoire gave this absolutely phenomenal introduction which, I can only imagine to a Western audience, everyone's like, gobsmacked.

Chris: Yes. So the things I remember about that meeting... I'd chosen carefully to sit in the middle of the room because I thought if I sat at the back, they might say, "Everyone at the back, come forth, there's lots of space!" and I was keen to be anonymous. But the first thing I remember was that Shri Mataji gave her talk and said, "Right, put your hands towards me." And immediately, this chap in the front row stood up and said, "Why do we have to do that? Why can't we..." and any sort of reticence I might have felt immediately vanished because I thought, "What an idiot this guy is." He's come all this way, sat through this amazing talk, and now he's walking out. But really, I think he'd come there to walk out and draw attention to himself. So he walked out.

At some point during the meeting, Shri Mataji looked at me, although I was sort of hiding in the middle of the room. There were quite a lot of people there, about 80 or 100, it seemed a lot to me. There were different rooms in Caxton Hall, and some of them were smaller than others. It wasn't one of the very big rooms, but it was quite large. And yeah, she looked at me and said, "Intellectual, you won't find the truth in books." And I heard myself saying, much to my surprise, "Yes, I know that, Shri Mataji." I don't remember if she pointed out about my hair at that point, and then at the end, someone took me up, and as I said, she worked on me.

I was impressed also by the half dozen original English Sahaja Yogis, plus people like Jamel and Gregoire who were there. There was something, to me at that time, kind of clear-cut about them, a clarity that I wasn't familiar with in my friends or other people. So that was impressive. It's worth saying that.

One of the things that kept me going—because in Bristol, of course, I didn't have anyone there; I said there was Alan Richards, but I met him quite a lot later.

Interviewer: What about those musician friends of yours? Did any one of them join you in any of the meetings? Are they still about?

Chris: They are. The girl who played violin, who shared our flat, she went on to have quite a successful career. She played on a famous piece of music which was a big hit, and she wrote a memoir recently that another friend told me I should read. She says some nice things about us, so I haven't got around to it yet. She didn't come to the meetings, but the band split up very shortly after this, and we went our separate ways.

But Steve Kirby was also living in the flat, and he came along at the end of the year, I think, in London at another Caxton Hall meeting. He came to Sahaja Yoga, and I was very pleased about that. He's a very great musician and very sensitive and humorous man. I still see him occasionally. He lives in America. I think he's maybe not meditating at the moment, but his wife is and his daughter is. He's a lovely man. He moved to America soon after this to go to Berkeley, the jazz college there, where he still teaches.

Chris: The next thing, before Ruth came along, was I used to go up to Caxton Hall meetings whenever I could, whenever I could afford it basically. There were quite a lot in those days. Marvelous talks. I think at that time, Shri Mataji was kind of pitching her introductions or her talks more deeply, in a more complex way. Maybe later she felt this isn't getting through, or maybe she felt she'd said enough of these sort of fundamental things. But for the most part, those talks were amazing.

We had a couple of seminars. One was at a place called East Hampstead Park, that was in October of '78. And then in December, there was one in a place in Sussex called Buxted. I went to those, and they really helped me a lot. It was more intimate in the sense that Shri Mataji was talking to people who'd been coming for a while; she didn't have to introduce the yoga.

The Buxted seminar... I remember it was a very spooky kind of place. I think it might have been an old convent. It's somewhere in East Sussex. I remember somebody... I went to the train station because I'd come all the way from Bristol. Most people were coming from London or Brighton. I was quite late. A friendly stranger at the train station said he'd give me a lift, but for some reason, he gave me a lift halfway and then just dropped me in the middle of nowhere. I remember walking; it was dark, very dark, down this quiet country road with all these woods around, feeling a very sort of spooky sensation about this place.

Anyway, I remember Mother when she arrived the next day. I think she was wearing black or a black cardigan. It was very unusual.

Interviewer: That is very unusual.

Chris: Yes, I just felt this is Mahakali dealing with all this spookiness.

Interviewer: This is 1978, the summer I would imagine?

Chris: December. And again, I learned a lot at that meeting. She explained that England was the Heart at this point, and I was very happy to know that. It really felt true to me. I remember other people saying, "Oh yeah, yeah," not seeming to see what an amazing thing that was.

Interviewer: Important to just sort of share with everyone that where you are in Bristol is the Vishuddhi.

Chris: Yes, so later we heard, not at this time, but later Mother had said it was the Vishuddhi of the Heart. And this makes sense in that North America was kind of discovered, from the European point of view, from Bristol. This was the Italian sailor John Cabot, Giovanni Caboto, who sailed from Bristol. Other things about the Vishuddhi: a lot of the slave trade was quite big here because it's on the coast. And balloons—we have a balloon festival—and aeronautics. We have a lot of very playful things here: kites, balloons, graffiti.

Interviewer: In your meditations, obviously you were coming to Caxton Hall or to a seminar when you could. One would imagine you were sort of meditating as the Sahaja Yogis had advised. So at what point did... what happened first? Did you meet Ruth first, or did you invite Shri Mataji first? How did that happen? Please share with us.

Chris: Okay. So Ruth must have moved in in 1979, quite early. We gradually got to know each other because she moved into the flat.

Ruth: I moved in in November 1978.

Chris: All right, so the end of '78. To get to my flat upstairs, you had to go through her flat. It was a nice house, actually, a very nice Georgian building in a part of Bristol called Montpelier. So you can live above someone without ever meeting them, but because I had to go through her flat, we met gradually.

Ruth: It was the corridor; we really had rooms, didn't we?

Chris: Exactly. And so we got talking. Yes, you can ask Ruth to take it from here.

Interviewer: You're a bit keen to hear what your journey was like, and yes, how did you find it?

Ruth: So I moved into the room below where Chris was living in 1978, and I was seeking very strongly. I think I have been seeking since I was a child, really, remembering how I felt about certain children's books and the symbolism in them, and how it really meant something to me. There were the George MacDonald books, and there's very clearly a figure of the Holy Spirit in them. I just loved those books, and I wanted to meet that lady. This was from when I was kind of 10, really young. It was definitely deeply in me. I read Jung's Memories, Dreams, Reflections when I was 15, so I was really looking for answers.

Just before I came, I was looking at all the religions and trying to discover about them. I always had a strong feeling for Jesus. I was in quite a tense state, going on for two years. Really bad, like I'd not sleep for five nights and then just crash out for a few hours, and then this whole thing would start again. I was looking for a solution to that. I went to this natural health meeting in the middle of Bristol, and somebody was talking about health and how something could cure it. At the end, all the people who had problems went up to the front where the man was saying, "Come and ask me about your problem." And I just thought, "I can't do that. That's not what I'm looking for." I sort of knew, even though I wanted to be cured, that wasn't what I was really looking for. It somehow seemed lower than what I was looking for.

I'd also been to the doctor, and the doctor had said, "Well, maybe you should talk to someone about this, a psychiatrist or something." He said, "I'll make an appointment for you, but somehow I don't feel you're ever going to need it." Quite strange, interesting. And it's in that month, between the appointment to see a psychiatrist about my insomnia, that I found out about it, that I got my Realization, actually.

Chris and I started talking when I moved in, and we found out that we both used the I Ching in a very similar way. We had the same copy, which had an introduction by Jung. So that was an immediate sort of connection. He'd been telling all his friends about Sahaja Yoga and thinking they'd all be as interested as he was, and finding it wasn't the case at all. So he didn't push it when he came to telling me. I remember him telling me about the Kundalini, and it can put all your problems right, and not only that, but you can feel the problems of other people and can put those right as well. I thought, well, if that's true, then what else is there?

He told me that there was this lady and I would be able to talk to her about these things. I can't remember him showing me a picture of Mother's photograph, because I didn't know what she was going to look like. But he told me she was at Caxton Hall. I was sort of making all these clothes at that time, my own creations, and although I wasn't sleeping, I was forcing myself to go up to London and take them around shops. I knew Chris had told me on a certain day Shri Mataji would be at Caxton Hall, so I planned it. I thought, "I'll go up to take these clothes, I won't tell Chris"—because I wanted to make my own mind up—"and maybe I'll go and see her in the evening."

All day I kind of trudged around the shops, very, very tired, obviously. Probably hadn't slept for three or four days, literally. At the end of the day, I thought, "Shall I go to that meeting, or shall I go home?" And suddenly, it was just as if the train pulled up. It was almost like I was carried to the meeting. Quite strange, no trouble getting there at all. Normally, with directions and things, I get a bit... but it just put me there.

When I came through the door, Felicity came up to me. Felicity had only been practicing Sahaja Yoga for about two or three months. This was in May 1979, on Ascension Day, interestingly. Felicity came up to me, she... I unloaded all these clothes on the chairs at the back, and she took me right up to the front, very keen to get me right in front of Shri Mataji. So I was in the front row, the middle of the front row, right in front of her.

There were probably 80, maybe 100 people there. Quite a lot. I remember it was only when I was sitting waiting for Shri Mataji that this incredible feeling of expectancy grew in me. I thought, "Who are we waiting for? Who is this lady?" because either Chris hadn't told me much about her, or I hadn't really put my attention on that aspect very much.

Suddenly, everybody stood up and I turned to look. This quite... she looked small, quite a small lady, walked in. Sometimes she looks much bigger. And she came and sat in the chair, which was directly in front of me. She talked for about an hour. All I can remember is how intense it was, like there was nothing that I thought... And then at the end of her talking, she said, "Right, this isn't about talking, it's about getting the experience. So put your hands towards me and shut your eyes."

I did that. I felt my Kundalini shoot up my back. It went on every chakra. I didn't know anything about it at all. I knew obviously something big had happened. I was amazed. Then I remember Douglas came and worked on me. I was very surprised because he was very down-to-earth, which was probably the best kind of person I could have had, really. Very straightforward. And he said, "Oh, how's your mother?" which was interesting because a lot of my problems, my tension, related to my relationship with my mother, which wasn't good. He said, "I can read my fingers like a typewriter." I was impressed with this. I said about problems with my mother, and he said, "I put a flower in front of your mother's photograph every day," which was a very interesting idea which I did, and I think it helped the forgiveness aspect.

Mother never actually put her attention directly on me at that meeting, even though I'm probably the only person that actually stuck on from that program, I imagine. She was dressed in white, and it was a very biblical scene. She came amongst everyone, and there were a lot of people all crowding around her. I remember she was in an incredibly motherly mood that night, which was exactly what I needed. So motherly and loving. She was sorting out, I think it was Maria, the Greek yogini, her relatives were there. And one of the relatives, who she was translating to Shri Mataji for, was talking about how her husband or someone had epilepsy. Shri Mataji was very sweet to her and said, "It's all right, he's all right now." And a little child wanted to bring Shri Mataji a flower and she couldn't reach, and then she said, "Bring her," and she picked her up in her arm.

I just felt something very special. I had this spontaneous feeling that I just wanted to touch any part of Shri Mataji, even like an edge of her sari. But I was much too shy to push myself forward and do it. But I really recognized that I had that feeling, and it's not a feeling I've ever had before. So that was significant. I thought I'd never seen love like that before.

Then I went home on the coach, got back very, very late at night. I did sleep that night, but for the first four nights, I had to have my light on because every time I shut my eyes... for that to stop. And then maybe within a month, my sleep was back to normal. The insomnia had just vanished. Extraordinary.

Interviewer: Were you then meditating when you got back immediately, or did it become...

Ruth: Well, I think I started talking to Chris, and then my questions started coming up. "How can it be? How can I just have found it? It's far too easy, it's not possible." So there was that sort of going on in my mind, just questioning. But obviously, I knew.

The second thing I really noticed was a change in me, a kind of shift in my awareness. It wasn't anything that I could consciously do anything about, but I had never noticed that happen to me before. A sense of being more of a witness. I was an emotional person, I was extremely emotional then, and I certainly wasn't a witness. But I noticed that sense of being a witness, that I wasn't quite so in the turmoil. I was standing back a little bit. And I really saw that, and I knew that was nothing I could do to make that happen. It just happened. And that was because of the meditation. And then obviously, we started meditating together. So it went from there.

Chris: That was one of the great days of my life, when the next morning she came and told me how she'd gone up to London.

Ruth: We were just friends then. He was just the guy in the flat upstairs.

Interviewer: Talk to us about it, please. So Chris, you were pleasantly shocked, surprised?

Ruth: The next morning I went up to his room, and I think he was in bed actually. It was about 10 o'clock, as students probably do.

Chris: I wasn't a student!

Ruth: Anyway, he loves cricket, and he started telling me all about a big cricket match the day before with England. He started telling me very excitedly all about this cricket match and all the details of it. And I just kind of listened because I knew I had some big news. I was enjoying it, in a way. So he went on about this cricket for ages, and then in the end, he stopped and I said, "I saw Shri Mataji yesterday." He nearly jumped out of the bed. I said, "I'm going to do it." He just couldn't believe it. After all this time telling everybody about it and no one, apart from Steve, being interested, he just couldn't believe that I said, "I'm going to do it."

It more or less happened the same way when I told my brother about it as well, Alan. One day, I was in the car with him from Bristol to Cheltenham, and all the way there I went on and on about Sahaja Yoga and Shri Mataji and who she was. At the end of the trip, we went into a pub, and he said, "Yeah, I'll do that." Oh, knowing Alan, he's just great, isn't he? Amazing.

Chris: The way she said, "I'm going to do this," I just felt... because obviously I'd been to lots of meetings with people who you never saw again, but I felt this was real. I was so happy. It's a big thing. So at that point, we had three people meditating in the house. It's funny, three people separately all came to live in the same house. Amazing.

Chris: I just remember a couple of things in '79. In October, I was in London. It must have been a meeting in the evening, Caxton Hall again. But for some reason, we'd gone round to her flat in Ashley Gardens, which was by Westminster Cathedral. I just remember we all lay on the floor while she was dealing with a French boy who was asking her a question about whether he should do something. She decided to go into the subconscious and look into this. So she lay down, we all lay on the floor, and she just immediately went to sleep and slept for, I don't know, 10 minutes, 20 minutes. And then she came back out of it and gave the boy his answer. Just going into the subconscious to look into something. It was quite amazing, quite surreal.

Later in November, we had our first public meeting in Bristol. I introduced it, but very uncertainly. Gavin Brown, who was one of the original people—he was Alan Richards's uncle, I think—came down and gave a proper introduction. We had a few people, 10 or 12 new people. Then we went on from there. One evening he couldn't come, and I had to give the whole talk. I remember sort of choking, but somehow the words got through, and that was the start.

In May 1980, there was another of these seminars. This was at Old Alresford Place in Hampshire. That was a great step forward again, I felt. Mother gave some beautiful, deep talks there. On the way home, I just remember an experience. I must have been... I had to change trains, I think it was in Winchester train station, waiting for the connection. Just this feeling of real bliss, which one doesn't often—or I don't often—feel. That absolute sense of being beyond all the worries and concerns. I used to have a lot of money worries, but just beyond them, absolutely in the heavenly world. That was a beautiful feeling. One needs these feelings from time to time to keep you going, I think.

I was going all this time to as many talks as I could. I just loved to hear Mother talk. I suppose I needed that intellectual food, but also Mother's talks were so interesting. They weren't what I was used to at all from lecturers, because they were more like pieces of music. They would take a theme and work on it, going here and there and building up to something, and you're not quite sure the path it's taking, and then it all comes back to the beginning again. Sometimes she would go into quite a critical mood and then almost always come back to something very positive, giving a feeling at the end. I just loved to hear her talking.

In the summer of 1980, around then, she was giving some really powerful talks. One I particularly wanted to mention was on the 30th of June that year. It was one about "Other Lokas, Other Dimensions," which is a very unusual talk. I don't think there's anything else quite like it. Quite a short talk, but so powerful. And again, I just felt a sublime feeling. She was talking about... she starts off something like, "I want to tell you about what is happening in other lokas, other dimensions which we don't see. There is a great war going on between the evil forces and the forces of God." That sense of this great war has always been very real to me and interesting to me. I don't know if it's because my father was a soldier... I was always interested in reading about wars. Not to say I'm a bloodthirsty person, but that sense that there is this war of good and evil going on, not just in this world but also in the unconscious world, this was always very real to me.

Interviewer: It's so pertinent even today, isn't it? Please remind us, the talk is in 1980?

Chris: The 30th of June, 1980.

Chris: In July that year, 1980, was the first time Shri Mataji came to Bristol for a meeting. She probably passed through it earlier because at some point there are photographs of her in Bath, and there was also a seminar before I came along, maybe in '76, down in Weston-super-Mare. So possibly she had passed through Bristol, but the first public program she came to was in July 1980 in Bristol. I don't know who arranged for Shri Mataji to stay in our house, but somehow that happened. So we suddenly found we were going to have Shri Mataji come to stay.

Ruth: We had two flats, basically.

Chris: Yes, we had two flats we could use.

Ruth: I knew she was coming and I wanted to give her a present. I had been collecting bits of antique fabric, and I made a special patchwork cushion out of them. At the intersections, there were covered buttons. Anyway, Shri Mataji stayed in my room downstairs. Everyone was sitting around, and she was sitting on the bed. At some point, I shyly said, "I've made a present for you, Shri Mataji. Can I give it to you?" And then she just laughed and she said, "Look at her! She asks if she can give me a present!" She said, "Of course you can."

So I went over and I gave her the cushion. She was saying very nice things about it, "What a beautiful feeling it has to it. Somehow this has got a very good feeling to it," she said. And then she gave me a hug and a kiss. I went back across the room and sat down, and she said, "Come here, I want to kiss you again." So I went back and she kissed me again.

Interviewer: Lucky you!

Ruth: I know, but so motherly, you see. Incredible.

Chris: We had the public meeting, and then Mother said to the new people, "Do come and visit the flat while I'm in Bristol." So a few people came around the next day. It was just fascinating to see Mother going into each person, talking to them in ways they could understand. There was one man... I never saw him again, but he was quite special. He'd been to India, he knew a lot about yogis and swamis and this and that. She was talking to him about things, and when he went, she said something like, "He'll be all right, David's looking after him." I thought, "Who is this David?" I assumed in my mind that she meant the biblical David is looking after him, because there weren't any other Davids that she could have referred to.

There was another young chap I remember Mother saying to him, "You know, this marijuana, this cannabis, is satanic." That was very strong. I remember saying this to a yogi not so long ago, and he was very surprised. I would have thought it was blindingly obvious, but anyway.

Ruth: Was that the time the young man talked about Madame Blavatsky?

Chris: Yes. We had this guy who was a Czech. He just happened to say, "Oh, Shri Mataji, your eyes remind me of Madame Blavatsky." And she said, "Forget Madame Blavatsky." And then there was another chap who came along that time who considered himself a healer. He was very much in need of healing, I would say. He called himself "Me." "I'm just Me." When he went—he didn't cause any trouble or anything—but Shri Mataji pointed to a cushion where he'd been sitting and said, "If you could all see the entities that are sitting on that cushion now, everyone would come rushing to me."

Ruth: Wow, yeah, we were all looking. I think we threw it out.

(Referring to a photo)

Chris: So this is outside our house. Just before this, actually, a real punk had come up the road from behind her, with screws through his face and brightly colored hair, probably in a mohican. He was smiling, he wasn't smashing bottles or anything. It was on the tip of my finger to take a photograph of him as he was passing Shri Mataji—sort of heaven and hell, you know? But I didn't do it. I felt, "No, that's not right. It's not right to make a work of art out of this. This is divine." So I let him go past.

Ruth: Also, in the evening when Shri Mataji came, she would be working on the yogis. I can remember her having her foot on my stomach, I think it was. She'd be working very hard. She was picking her sari, and she had her suitcase open and she was saying, "What sari shall I wear?" She picked a purple one up. "A strong, regal color," she said. "Maybe this is a bit too strong, frighten them," she said. So she picked, I think it was a white one. She was doing this little play of choosing a sari, and then she looked up sort of mischievously and said, "Who would be a woman?"

It was an amazing time, feeling that intimacy.

Chris: And she gave... this is an elephant bell. When she arrived at our house, she did a kind of maya, pretending to think that Ruth and I would be married. So she presented this bell to us as a couple. I had to say, "We're not married, Mother." So then she said, "Well, which of you is going to have this?"

Ruth: And I said, "I will!" because I really liked it.

Chris: And she said to someone else, "Go to the boot of the car and get another present for Christopher."

(Ruth rings the bell)

Ruth: It's got carving, it's brass, very small intricate carving. She said to me this would have all been enameled when it was made, so I think it's quite an old one. Beautiful.

Interviewer: At that point, obviously, although you were friends and meditating together, it didn't come in your attention that maybe you should get married or anything like that?

Chris: I was pretty much a confirmed bachelor and very resistant to actually committing to anybody. Maybe if Shri Mataji hadn't come on the scene, he never would have, I don't know. The first time she came, she talked about this, and the reasons why it wasn't working out. She said, "Don't worry, I'll look after it," or something. So that whole year, 'til the next time she came, it was kind of hanging in the air.

Ruth: The second time she came, this was in August 1981. I was working in a place called the Pump House, a restaurant bar. I was cooking, so I had to go off on one of the days to do my job. In that day, she must have talked to Chris about marrying me. So I had a phone call at work saying, "Will you marry me?" And I just said, "Yes," and got back to cooking.

Before she went, when I went to work, she said, "Come and see me off at the station." And I said, "I don't know if I can get away, Mother." And she said, "Don't worry, just tell them you've got to go and see your mother." And the extraordinary thing was that when it came to the time to go, there was no one around to ask. I just walked out and went to Temple Meads, to the station, to see her off. And no one ever mentioned it. No one ever said, "Where were you? You disappeared."

Chris: She talked to me about getting married to Ruth, just me and her in the room.

Interviewer: What did she talk to you about, if you'd like to share?

Chris: She asked me about myself. I was very lucky to have this kind of special treatment. In fact, we had a mutual friend, so we could have met earlier in our lives. We were invited to the same wedding when we were about 21 or 22. I was the best man. It was very strange. But anyway, Mother sort of asked me about myself and about my parents, who were long dead. I never really knew my mother; she died when I was an infant. I think that was one of the reasons probably why I was never quite sure... I hadn't had the immediate experience of having a mother, so I was always quite diffident with Shri Mataji, I would say. Sometimes her maya could really bring out the more playful side, but at other times, I was quite diffident.

I always felt a kind of awe from the first time I saw her at Caxton Hall. I was very aware that this is not an ordinary person. She's Mahamaya, but not ordinary at all. I was often very surprised at how people could behave around her, as if they were completely... quite odd. Some people would always be in the front, and so on.

But yes, so she told me it would be good to get married to Ruth. She said some very nice things about her, how she was very unusual for someone in the West. She hadn't met anyone else like Ruth who had that sort of feeling quality in the West. She's like Princess Diana, who was about to be married in a few days' time at that point.

Ruth: That's '81, sorry.

Chris: Yeah, '81. And I wasn't that interested in the Royal Wedding, but I was sort of interested. She obviously sensed that, not from anything I said, so she said, "Well, maybe more like Juliet in Romeo and Juliet." And there she won me over. She had been talking about Shakespeare. She quoted, "There is a tide in the affairs of men, which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune." She knew, I think, that sort of an appeal through English poetry would spark with me. She said I was a bit like Shakespeare, that he had a long time sitting on a mountaintop before he became Shakespeare. She said she preferred Blake because of Blake's heart, but it wasn't a put-down of Shakespeare.

She implied that Ruth had had some lives that were difficult, and this was why she was so pure, whereas I had had some nice lives. I said, "Is this definitely the right thing to do, Mother?" And she kind of looked into the distance and said, "Yes, I think you're very fortunate."

So I said, "Right, let's get married."

Ruth: Shri Mataji arranged it all, and then Chris said, "Oh, when will that be, Shri Mataji?" thinking he'd have another year at least to think about it.

Chris: Sunday.

Ruth: Which was four days from then.

Chris: Sixteen weddings happening at Chelsham Road on the 9th of August, 1981, for the Vishuddhi. She came straight from Bristol for these weddings.

Ruth: Shri Mataji gave all the brides a sari. I remember her saying, "This one's for a blonde," and then she said, "You can have it, Ruth." I was thinking, "I'm not really blonde," but she gave me a nice patterned light silk sari. And we have a candlestick, she gave us a candlestick.

Chris: We just... it was so humble. We had no idea. We didn't have the means, for a start, but also things were very humble in those days. It hadn't built up to the way you treat the gods and everything has to be beautiful and perfect. We did our best with the limited means we had. This was in my room, above Ruth's.

Here she's looking at Blake. There's a catalogue to an exhibition of Blake in London. Someone had shown it to her, and she was very pleased, commenting on some of the pictures. You can see from moment to moment, her mood was lovely and jolly in the previous one, and then very thoughtful and contemplative.

After I'd agreed to get married, I looked out the window and there were these clouds in the sky that were just like exclamation marks. It was extraordinary. I was sort of in sync with everything. Celebrations celestial and everywhere.

Later that year, Mother had bought the Brompton Square house in London, and a lot of people were working there. She talked to us a bit. You were talking about advice. She told me to reveal myself to her more, to trust other people. The Vishnu Granthi Vibhedini mantra. She said, "This is good for trust."

And when we were working at Brompton Square—I'm not very good at DIY, as Ruth will tell you—but anyway, she said, "Don't be afraid of making mistakes." This was something I was definitely always disliking, the idea of making mistakes, but of course, that can prevent you from doing anything.

Ruth: I remember one day we went there and she said to me, "Have you been arguing or something?" And she put her elbow on my Agnya, twisting it. She said... and I said, "Yes, we have." She said, "Go and tell him you love him very much." So I went and found him and I said, "Mother says I love you very much."

Chris: The story I wanted to tell was from 1981, I think we'd just got married. We were going to a meeting at Chelsham Road, and on the way, we stopped to pick someone up. While we were waiting, there were some National Geographics. I started leafing through them and came to these photographs of a mother crocodile with her mouth open, and she carries all the baby crocodiles in her mouth. It was amazing. I showed it to Chris and he said, "Oh, disgusting!" I said, "It's so sweet, really," because she was carrying her babies in her mouth.

Then when we went to the meeting, she gave her talk, and halfway through she said, "See how the mother crocodile carries the baby crocodiles in her mouth." I literally jumped. It was just showing you that all the time, she can see what you're up to. And she was watching us approaching. Absolutely gosh.

Interviewer: That's amazing. Okay, shall we take a little break now and then we regroup? Thank you so much for telling us about how you got your Realizations so far, and then Shri Mataji visiting you, and then your marriage, which is amazing, and the photographs that we learned about. We'll talk about the other experiences in a short while.
