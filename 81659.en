I thought it would be good to start out with some questions about who you are, who were you as a child, what people influenced you, what brought you to the place you are today as a luminous being sitting before me and before us.

I am a very ancient being. That problem is like this. And what can I tell you about myself? I just don't know what part will interest you. But the only thing I can say is that I was born with this understanding and awareness that I have to find out a method by which I could give en masse realization to people. I was a realized soul, of course. I knew all about it from my very childhood. But the problem was how to make many people get it. Because if one person gets it, or if one person has it, if one person is an incarnation, people don't understand it. Not only that, but they may even try to destroy such a person.

That's what happened to all the saints who came on this earth. Christ was crucified. Muhammad Sahib was given poison. Because they were ignorant. They did not know what it was, what he was saying. So it was important, first of all, to find out a method how to give them en masse realization. And from that angle, I just thought that this is why I am on this earth. And I have to do this job. For which I wanted to study about human beings.

I took my birth in a Christian family, and that too, a family which was Protestant. I felt that Protestants are fanatics, but very sophisticated. And they rationalize everything to such an extent that nobody can see beyond it. So I better take my birth in them. And my father and mother had already taken birth, whom I had chosen as my parents. They were great people, realized souls. And especially my father was the person who knew why I was on this earth. Even my mother knew about it. So a special rapport was between them and me. And they could understand why I was busy meditating or finding out about how to give realization to others.

Then I would say my father was a very learned man who knew about 14 languages, who translated Quran Sharif into Hindi, who was a member of the constituent assembly. He made our constitution. Also, he was the only Christian to be elected in those days. And then my mother was an honors in mathematics. All very well-educated and nice people. They dedicated their life to the cause of freedom of India. And I also felt that that was very important. Because if we are not free, we cannot do anything on a religious basis. This one thing is to be free from this slavery. And that's how I also helped them a lot. And our whole family suffered a lot. Terrible times. Terrible times.

At a very young age, I was with Mahatma Gandhi also because he liked me very much as a child. So I stayed on with him. Then I used to come back to study, again, go back to him. He used to call me Nepali because my face is a Nepali face. And he used to talk to me as if he's talking to his grandmother sometimes. He was very sweet. And he was a very sweet man. Extremely sweet person to children. Very strict with himself and strict with others. But with children, he was very, very sweet and kind. And would try to learn from children a lot of things. It was surprising how he understood that there's a lot of wisdom with the children sometimes than with the older people who are mixed up.

Now we got our independence. And we had a very bad setback because of the partition we had in our country. I was studying in Lahore Medical College there because I wanted to know about medicine, what these people call such and such thing. I knew all this. I knew about the body. I knew about everything, what you call the complete nervous system. But I did not know what was the vocabulary attached to it. So I studied there for two years. So I had to discontinue with my studies. And my parents wanted me to get married. And then I found that my marriage was important. I agreed to marry. And I married this gentleman, Mr. C.P. Srivastava.

Then, during all that time, my only pastime or the full-time work was to find out about human beings. What's the problem they have? How would they avoid reality? How they shun it? How they run away from it? What are their problems? How are they seeking? What do they have to offer? What will they accept? How to handle them? It was quite an intricate question. Every person provided a new sample of problems. And I had to fight it out in a way that it was a system which I knew how to do it. Problems of the Kundalini. You can go into the journey and find out about a person.

And then I found out the permutations and combinations of their problems. So it is like, you can say, that like periodic tables. You have to divide them into three, then into seven, then into their permutations and combinations. So you can imagine three into seven raised to power eternally. It was like that. But it doesn't matter. It worked out.

In the year 1970, on the 5th of May, I was a little bit hesitant at that time. I thought I should wait. But certain circumstances made me open the last center. And when I opened the last center, we started working with others on our scale.

Thank you, Jim. Thank you, Hilary. Thank you both again on our Zoom session to talk about times with Shri Mataji.

Nice to be with you too. Thank you.

Jim, would you like to share with us this excerpt of Shri Mataji that we heard? Please.

This was 1983 when Shri Mataji gave the opportunity to about six married couples to come from England to North America for quite an extensive tour she did that year. Programs were held in New York, Boston, Houston, San Diego, Los Angeles, Berkeley, and Vancouver and Toronto. There may have been others, but I know those for sure. And Hilary and I were given the opportunity to help out with the seminar that was planned in Santa Cruz, California, where that excerpt was taken from a local radio station called KAZU out of Monterey, California. The lady, Barbara Rose Schuller, conducted an interview, which is, of course, much longer than that excerpt.

It's one of a kind, really. And I would really suggest and recommend that Sahaja Yogis watch that interview. There was a lot more to it. There were four sessions with Shri Mataji of multiple hours, where people asked questions that Sahaja Yogis would not dare ask. So it gives an insight as to how she handled people in such a loving, delicate way. But the interview itself was quite remarkable. That was 1983 in Santa Cruz, California.

Yes, amazing details to know about, and I look forward to actually watching that whole interview. Thank you for sharing that 1983 Santa Cruz seminar. I'd like to start this with sharing some of your photographs, which we couldn't in our previous interview because of some technical issues. While I get those photos online, would you, Hilary and Jim, talk about how the restaurant that you had mentioned earlier actually came about? Because that was something that you hadn't done before. What brought that about, please?

The beginning was 1981. We had come back from the India tour without jobs or prospects. And we began working at a whole food store, which was the old-style collective, if you will, type of hippie whole food store, of which there were 16 members. And the name of the store was Arjuna. We had trivial jobs, but it was income. I was also doing some construction in our neighborhood. And the principal in the collective was a fellow named Jolie, who was also my tabla teacher. He suggested that instead of working at the store, we instead went out to a restaurant they had started at the hospital. It was a joint effort between the Cambridge University medical students and the store, primarily and solely for, at that time, the medical students. And so we said, "Sure, pay us the same. We'll do it." We went out, we started working there. And then after a week, he said, "Do you want to come back and work here on a regular basis?" And we said, "Sure."

So that's how it basically started. And then after a very short period of time, Jolie suggested that they weren't interested in carrying on with the restaurant. Would we like to take it over? Now, we had done a program in Cambridge and another program in Norwich. And on the way back from the program in Norwich, 1981, Shri Mataji had said to us, as we were driving back, she leaned back from her front seat and looked at me and said, "You should have a restaurant." So ordinarily, I would have said, "Yeah, right." But since she said that, and since we had this restaurant and this fellow had actually offered it to us, we accepted it.

When we started out, they gave everything to us: all of the facilities, all of the implements, the refrigerator, the stove, everything they gave to us. And all of the stock, all the rice and oats and beans and everything. They were that anxious to be shot of it. So we started out. It took us, I think, three or four months before we were confident enough to actually take over. We worked for them on an hourly basis until the time that we were confident. We printed up some menus and began. So it was basically a luncheonette. We didn't do dinner. We just did lunch, morning coffee, afternoon tea, that sort of thing, scones and so forth. And it was very successful.

I have a menu here. On the first page, it says, "Welcome to Blossom Time Restaurant at Addenbrooke's Hospital." It's so nice to see Shri Mataji's photograph.

As you're doing that, let me just show you a magazine that the Cambridge University students printed. They did an article on us. They wanted to do an article on us. And I said, "Well, if so, I want to talk about Shri Mataji in the article." Then at one point, the fellow came and said, "Look, we're almost ready to go to deadline and we really don't have time for an article." I said, "What about if I write the article, give a pseudonym or a ghost name as the writer, and make it appear as if we were interviewed?" And they said that would be fine.

So that was the article that they did. I spent quite a long time explaining about Shri Mataji and about Sahaja Yoga, how to get realization, how to meditate and so forth in the article, which not one word was changed.

This is the kind of photo we were searching for. This is, on the left, is Luis Perez Salas, who worked for us. And then it's Brigitte Sogstad, who also worked for us. It's just very nice how the lush climbers are surrounding Shri Mataji's photograph. It's a beautiful photo of Shri Mataji and all of you working in such a nice team and giving vibrations to the Nabhi's there at a time when it's pretty testing and challenging for the people there. Not to mention the staff, but also the families and stuff who came to see you, I mean, to have food in your restaurant.

Some of the other Sahaja Yogis that worked for us, Baltrad West was one. Rodrigo Perez Salas and Frank Lord also worked for us. We also had non-Sahaja Yogis working for us. The best of which was Susan Gregory, who, I think, may have been born realized. She was a joy to have. We also had other workers from Paris, from Italy, from Poland, and so forth. So we ran this restaurant for about eight years.

So it was after this restaurant that Shri Mataji asked you both to go to America.

I'll tell you a kind of a story that actually happened while we were running the restaurant. We didn't own it, so we rented it from this student committee. So they really had jurisdiction over it. One time they wanted to have a party and bring people into our part of the restaurant. And they said that they might want to serve alcohol. So we said, "No, no. We don't believe in drinking." But they pretty much insisted. So they had their event. We used to also use the common room next door, which was a large room where people could take their trays of food and eat. And so then we came in to run the restaurant. And people said, "Don't you know about the flooding?"

We said, "Well, no." And we went over to the common room and it was completely under two or three inches of water. Our restaurant here, where we prepare the food, is fine. And they said, "Well, that's because you're on a higher level." I always found that very amusing. And it happened actually round about Guru Puja time. So it was amazing how, although we were forced to do what we didn't want to do, the divine worked things out that the water came and purified.

It's also how beautiful Shri Mataji works it out that the excerpt that you kindly chose is actually talking about the opening of Sahasrara and realization, when we have Sahasrara Puja next weekend. It's all these beautiful things that Shri Mataji takes care of. We can't even imagine.

Shri Mataji did visit there once when we had a puja in Cambridge. She did come and we served dinner to her. And I remember her coming in and she looked around and she said, "Oh, it's nicer than I expected."

This is our original wedding photograph. This would have been six years before self-realization, six years before we met Shri Mataji. This is Lake Tahoe on the border of California and Nevada. And we had just gotten married.

How did you two meet then? It's a very amazing journey. How did it start?

Well, I was working for the airlines as an airline hostess in those days. I wanted to take a trip up into an area of California for three days. After these three days of just traveling around, it was very, very hot. And so I felt like I might fall asleep driving back to San Francisco. So let me try and find somewhere I can spend a few hours and then I'll drive back later. So I dropped into this little store and I said, "Is there anywhere I can go and just rest for a few hours until I go back to San Francisco and have a swim?" And they said, "Yes. Scott's Flat Lake. Go there." So I got a few snacks and off I drove to Scott's Flat Lake and was just sitting there resting by the lake when along comes Jim. And that's how I met him. We struck up a conversation, which, of course, ended up with us getting married. We were married about two years later.

And this is our second wedding. This is our Sahaj wedding. This is at Cheltenham Road, around about the time of Shri Krishna Puja. And there were 16 couples. Shri Mataji officiated for the ceremony. The part that I remember most is that we were going around the fire, and Shri Mataji was close by. And she tied my sari to Jim's kurta top. And then she said, "Now it's done. There, now it's done."

In other words, don't think about ever separating. I can honestly say that after getting married in Sahaja Yoga, it just felt totally different. There was no question that we would be together forever. Before, we had little quarrels and so on. But after that, things were totally different. We had actually said to Shri Mataji, because we were married before self-realization, that if she thought it was best that we separated or divorced, we were willing to do that. And so that was her answer.

And that's by the River Cam. This was 1984. There is on YouTube a video of that and the interview with the BBC. I again recommend people to watch that. Not because of me, but because of the interview. And her experience where she actually felt, Shri Mataji gave her realization on the spot. She felt it coming out. And her comment at the end of the interview to the camera, to the audience, was, "I must admit that the cool I felt coming out of my head was nothing compared to the gale force that was coming out of Shri Mataji's head." She actually asked Shri Mataji to feel the top of her head. And we were aghast and amazed. We'd never do that.

She asked, "I guess the cool breeze is always coming out of your head." And Shri Mataji shyly said, "Well, I guess." And she said, "Can I feel it?" And Shri Mataji said, "Well, okay." And she did. "Oh, oh, I do feel it." It was quite remarkable.

I'd like to share some photographs that Jim, you had sent about 1983 when Shri Mataji had asked both of you along with the other six couples to go to the United States of America. Would you like to talk us through them, please?

This was a puja with Shri Mataji in Dr. Warlicker's home in Cerritos, California. And that's almost all of the people who were in attendance. It was a very small little family gathering. I believe that's Dave Dunphy. You can barely see his face on the far left. And that's Dr. Warlicker with his family there. Very nice. 1983, we were fortunate enough to be there.

Then we went to see Felicity and Richard Payment with their new child, Gautama, in Vancouver. That was another place where Shri Mataji was going to hold the program. We didn't go to the program there, but we were able to visit.

There were two things that you wanted to mention. One was the picnic date, wasn't it? Would you like to please?

Well, I just mentioned afterwards that I think I had got the year wrong for the picnic in Paris and the trip there. I think it's 1980. That's a lovely time. Imagine picnics with Shri Mataji.

Did you want to mention why Shri Mataji brought us to America, the conversation you had about those different cities?

Yes, please. I could talk about it. Quite amusing. We had been out of America except for the 1983 trip, which I think we took about three weeks for. That was another wonderful thing about the restaurant. We went to at least six or seven pujas in Europe. A couple in Austria, two or three in Switzerland, two in Italy. We would just put a sign on the door, "We're closed until such and such a day," and take off.

So that was nice. But other than the three weeks or so that we came to America in 1983 in a very cosseted atmosphere, we knew nothing about America. We'd been out of the country for 16 years. So one day on the television, there was a news report. And it came out that the headline was, "Washington, D.C., Murder Capital of America." And I thought, "Oh, wow." So I had that in the back of my mind. And very shortly after that, Shri Mataji came to Shudy Camps, which is only about 10 miles from Cambridge. So we spent quite a bit of time there because I could go to the warehouse and get things wholesale and take to the people at Shudy Camps.

One day Shri Mataji was visiting. And someone said to me, "Jim, Shri Mataji wants to see you up in her room." I said, "Okay." I went up. And she says, the only person in the room at that time was Harsh, but he was quite close to Shri Mataji in those days. He was with her. And Shri Mataji said, "Oh, Jim, I was thinking it's time for you to go back to America." And I said, "Yes, Shri Mataji." I was a bit shocked. But I'm American, so that was okay. And she says, "So, Harsh, what do you think? Where's a good place to send him? What about Washington, D.C.?" And I said—now, not what I'm thinking, but what I said was—"Yes, Shri Mataji, whatever you say." And then she said, "But, well, or what about New York City?" And, "Yes, Shri Mataji, whatever you suggest." To me, I mean, I'm a small-town boy from California. New York City to me is hell. But, "Yes, Shri Mataji, whatever you say."

So then she said, "Or, I know, what about Miami?" And, oh, my God, I'm thinking, "Yes, Shri Mataji, whatever you think is best." And she said, "Oh, well, let's not make a decision now. I'm going away. I'm going back to America. And then I'll come back and we'll talk about it." We have a restaurant. We have a house. We have cars. We have all the trappings of a middle-class existence. And we had a wonderful life, don't get me wrong. The restaurant, it was like playing restaurant for eight years. It wasn't like work at all. We really enjoyed it.

So in the meantime, she comes for the tour. This was 1989. She comes for the tour in America and visits Cincinnati, Ohio. And Bala Kaniasson, who you know, was living there because he was working for General Electric Aircraft Engines. He had arranged a program, and Shri Mataji went to the program and was quite impressed with Cincinnati. So when she came back, I got the call again at Shudy Camps. "Shri Mataji wants to see you." I went up and Shri Mataji said, "Jim, I have the perfect place for you: Cincinnati, Ohio. Bala's there and he wants to have an ashram and it's going ahead now." I said, "Wonderful, Shri Mataji." Because I knew Cincinnati was a bit smaller, a bit lower key than these other places she had mentioned.

That's how we ended up in Cincinnati. She came back about a week later and we were there at Shudy Camps and she looked at us and she said, kind of in shock, "Jim and Hilary still here?" A week later. So we very quickly wrapped up everything. And after that, I think we were gone in about one month. Came back to America. That's how it happened.

When she first said Washington, D.C., New York, or Miami, she then went to America and came back. So we hadn't thought about doing anything at that point. She said, "Let's not do anything now. Wait till I come back and we'll talk about it." So then when she came back and said Cincinnati, and then it was a week after that that she said, "Are you still here?" Then it was three weeks after that that we were in America.

How did you wrap up things so quickly? On a physical, on a gross level, to pack everything up and move there and then to settle there, what was it like?

We sold our car to Raj and Uma. We gave away our washer and dryer to Mark and Shirley Constable. We had a lot of houseplants in the restaurant; we gave those to Bob who was working for us at the time. Then there was also a lady who used to do pastry and bring them to us to sell. And we offered her the restaurant and we gave her everything. The cook stove, the refrigerator, all the pots and pans and all the things that we had. We only rented a house, so it was a rental and we were on a month-to-month basis. So that was easy. We had Nita French who was working for us at the time and living with us as well. And she moved back to Brighton. So like you say, everything just sort of falls into place. And it was three weeks to the day that we got on a plane and came to America.

What was it like, Hilary, for you going from England to America, vibrationally, spiritually? Was it vastly different?

Well, I had lived in the Bay Area of San Francisco when I was flying for the airlines for five years. So I was already kind of familiar with America. And I'd lived in Miami for a while. So I was somewhat familiar with America, but Cincinnati was different. It was in the Midwest. I think a little bit more low-key. But what was so wonderful was when we got here, there was a small collective, but they welcomed us with such open arms and such warmth and love that we immediately felt at home, I think.

And we found jobs. That was again, Shri Mataji’s blessing. We ran into somebody in a convenience store that they owned. It was the son. We were talking about needing to find a job. And he said, "Well, come down to the main office and we'll talk." And then we both got jobs with this convenience store chain called United Dairy Farmers, where we became managers. And he found two stores that were close by because we only had one car. So we just traveled in the one car and then he dropped one or the other off and came home and everything, like you say, flowed due to Mother's grace.

How was it, trying to spread the vibrations and hold public programs and meetings there? What was it like compared to England?

Shri Mataji came to Cincinnati in 1989 and had a public program. So people were holding programs. Of course, it was a smaller group than in England, but everybody was very dedicated and we had regular meetings and people came. Some people stuck on, some people didn't. The collective now has about maybe 35 to 40 people. Over the years, we've had a lot of people actually move away to different places. Our collective is very diverse, really. We probably have about 50-50% from India and then Italians, Russians, English. We had Swiss at one time and German. So it's quite diverse.

Did Shri Mataji visit frequently when you were there in Cincinnati?

Yeah, she did come again in 1992. She had another program at this beautiful place called Ault Park down in Cincinnati. It's open air. So that was very beautiful and the weather held, was lovely. It's the same place that Bala held the first program. Interesting thing about this pavilion is that on the wall of the stage, there's a quotation from Wordsworth, a very famous quotation. And it says, this is not verbatim, but, "Enough if our hands have power to reach another hour." And that's where Shri Mataji had her program.

When she came, they found a hotel for Shri Mataji, very nice, downtown in Cincinnati. At that time, I would say that we didn't do as much as some of the people here because we were working for this convenience store and the hours were unbelievable. Shri Mataji came to Bala's house and gave a talk and met everyone. At that time, Bala had brought in quite a few Americans, many of whom are still Sahaja Yogis. So there are a lot of long-standing yogis here.

Did you go to Cabella and spend some time with Shri Mataji from America?

I went to Cabella only one time. And that was in 2000. And the added incentive, as if you needed one, was that all of the planets were lined up on Sahasrara day that year. That's the only time I've been to Cabella. That was wonderful. But we were able to see Shri Mataji whenever she came to America, and she visited a lot in those days. Nearly every year. We were able to go to all those programs. We used to split it up. I would go to the West Coast and Hilary would go to the East Coast so that we could keep the restaurant.

Any other memories that you'd like to share with us of times with Shri Mataji, be it in England or America?

When Shri Mataji came to America, by then there were many more Sahaja Yogis, and we didn't really have that personal time so much with Shri Mataji as we had when we were in England. It was more like attending a puja or attending a public program. I remember seeing her at the airport when she was in Cincinnati, but it was more at a distance, I could say.

There was one time in California where I went out and met her at the airport. We were riding the escalator and it was just Shri Mataji and myself. We'd been in Cincinnati for quite a number of years. And I said to her, "Shri Mataji, I'm thinking about moving back to California." Hoping that she would say, "Yes, great idea." Because we always wanted to move. And instead of yes or no, she just said, "Well, you know, California is better now, but not usually." So I took that as a hint. We're still in Cincinnati.

We're actually in a suburb about 20 miles from Cincinnati. And the name of the town is Loveland. L-O-V-E-L-A-N-D. Well, that's kind of why we picked it. When we arrived, we stayed at Bala's for a little while. And then we thought, well, we really do need to get an apartment. So we looked on the map and we saw this place called Loveland. It was near the Little Miami River. And we thought, well, let's try that.

I know you wanted to ask us about how we felt about Indian people and what we had learned from India and Indian people. I can't really come up with anything other than to say they're just nicer people. Less demanding, less aggressive, just nicer people. And spirituality, in whatever form it takes for them, is the root of their life. They think to seek the highest. It's a normal thing for them, whatever path it takes them to, to try and achieve that. Which we don't have here. It's more of organized religion, capitalism. And their family, the way that they revere, the way they treat older people, it's very nice. They have a respect for them. They have a respect for family members. Their children are brought up very well, too.

We were on the India tour. And as we said in our last interview, we had been in India for over a year before self-realization. So we were pretty immersed in the culture. But when we went on the tour after getting self-realization and came back to England, I noticed that I had not felt guilty about anything being in India. That sense of guilt, which is so predominant in Western societies because of the atrocities that they brought on the world, to be very frank, there is a lot of guilt. And I think the Christian religion kind of puts that on people as well. You're guilty, you're born guilty, your original sin and all that. So that was remarkable that I didn't feel guilty when I was in India. And I feel less guilty now because of that. We all make mistakes, but we all have a conscience. And no matter how sophisticated you are, you can't hide from that conscience, although you may try in the Western society.

When I meditate, oftentimes, I will say to myself, the quotation that Shri Mataji made in a lecture, or perhaps a reference to Shri Krishna: "Nirananda, it is the joy, joy, and nothing else but joy." And by saying that to myself, it works.

Is there any other advice or anecdote that you would like to share?

Be the best you you can be. I'm the most unoriginal person I know. But I once saw a quotation roughly to the effect that plagiarism is the greatest form of flattery. And a lot of writers will say that there is nothing original. They may put it in different words, in different contexts, in a different framework, but all the truths are there.

I didn't know whether you wanted to share those couple of pictures from 59 Sturton Street, when Shri Mataji visited us.

That was in the front living room of this little tiny house in Cambridge. Two up, two down. Probably about 800 square feet. It was very small. Actually, the first time, she was supposed to stay at another house in Waterbeach, close by Cambridge. And at the very last moment, the lady there said for whatever reason, "I'm not able to host Shri Mataji." It was like two days before she was coming. And we said, "Oh, my. Okay." What an opportunity.

Scurried around, trying to clean the place up. I think we got some new carpet at the last minute. And Frank Lord, who was living nearby, I think he bought the mattress and we bought the bed for Shri Mataji. And then, you know, dashing around getting bedding, everything that Shri Mataji could possibly want. So nervous. But at the same time, so caught up in all the energy of preparing.

And the joy. The radiant smiles of both of you speak for itself.

Would you please share a prayer that you mentioned that Juan Mascaró, the Sanskrit scholar, the realized Sanskrit scholar, said when he saw Shri Mataji when she visited him? Shall we say it together to conclude today's session?

Jai Shri Mataji.

Thank you so much for such a lovely time.

It's all thanks to Shri Mataji for giving us this beautiful moment. And the Sahaj family. Thank you so much, Hilary. Very much love to you and carry on the good work. You're the perfect interviewer. Really. You have those beautiful qualities that make everybody feel so loved, so comfortable.

Most kind of you. I do not deserve this. But thank you. I'll stop recording now. Jai Shri Mataji. Thank you.
