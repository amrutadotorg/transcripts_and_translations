Public Program, "All are Seekers". Vauxhall Centre, London (UK), 6 November 1980.

You are seekers.   And that's a category of  human beings.  Everybody do it  from choice.  That's  one thing  I have discovered.   Some are Seekers who are argument seekers,  generally speaking.  Some are just sort of fashions which are there; they are because they see everybody seeking so  they must  have the  fashion of  seeking.  And  there are another  category  also who  are  not  seeking  God but  are  seeking something else and find God.  They are special cases, somehow.

In any case this seeking has given them sensation as only the manifestation of the seeeking has been changing. At the start with the amoeba we had a seeking of self. You were just seeking food. You were worried about food and nothing else.

Here is the centre of seeking within us which is called as Nabhi Chakra which is the green centre in the picture. There is the Nabhi Chakra which is for our seeking. This centre is a subtle centre. All these centres that you see here are subtle centres. You cannot see that with naked eye unless und until you have your Kundalini union which is settled down in the triangular bone there.

Now this Kundalini is very well settled in human beings that as amoeba your seeking was very limited. Like the seed sprouts you started developing new seed. When you became a human being you started seeking power. The first people who were human being it was important to protect themselves and they started beginning of this organisations or societies or groups and cults just to protect themselves. They knew that there was some other force which was, there but they did not know what it was.

So they started looking out in the nature trying to find out. Some started worshipping this, some started worshipping that. But still they were not satisfied because their power, whatever they got, so-called power, they found, ultimately led them to unhappiness and disillusion.

When the society was better organised they had big states and government and all roof new types of administrations which developed all over the world. But the administratio and all that also proved that by administering other people you cannot administer yourself. We cannot control ourself. We cannot control many things within ourselves. For example, if you are running fast with your, eh, breathing increases, but it slows down by itself. Your heart beat increases but comes down by itself. Who controls that? We cannot do that.

There are so many things within us which we do not control and are called as autonomous, by nature. And as, organisations within us or we can call things instutions within us which are doing this were doing great. And these names are just names. They do not explain anything about them. They say that they should be called an autonomous nervous system but who is this auto? Who is this Mr. Auto? Who is doing the job? After all we should find out. Isn't it nice to brand someone as autonomous.

Say for example you say automobile, then automobile doesn't move by itself; there is a driver sitting inside. Now who is this one? That should be found out and if science is to be true to itself and to its ethos then it should try to find out who is this auto who is managing our autonomous nervous system. But they reach at a point where they cannot find further so they just say, so far, so much, not further. That's how they explain, but they are honest people, I must say. Because they say that there are chemicals within us like gasinolene and asticholene and their behaviour within us is something one doesn't understand because they augment wherever they like. They direct wherever they like. You cannot say why they behave in this manner. You cannot explain. So they say the modus action of these chemicals cannot be explained, finished.

What is beyond it they cannot see and to go beyond they have to know that their awareness is not adequate. Here I allow myself to expand much more, like for medicenes they had to devise things like say microscope to see what was under the skin. What we have senses. In the same way their awareness has to grow at a point where they can understand what is the essence, what is the base of our life, how we are made. And why we are going into all these modes which they cannot explain.

One day to look at a tree is to see how gib it is. The West if you see is mostly outside grown very big. So the depths must be found, the source to sustain. This fictory has to come from somewhere. For me the tree is the same whether east, west, north, south. ou see for some people east is different, west is different. It's not so. It's  one. God has created only one world. He didn't create east, west, north, south. He did not create. He just created one actual people because he didn't want to create a military or some plastic flowers. He wanted to create a living people.

So the search within started east and they started meditating to find out what is the source to sustain this earth growth out. And when they started going deep into it they found within themselves that there is a force which is called as Kundalini right there in the triangular bone. And this Kundalini unless und until it is awakened, unless und until this germinating force within us is awakened we cannot have that new dimension of our awareness. Our awareness is only limited by our rationality. We cannot yet be, go beyond. By rationality you cannot understand it. You cannot understand God. You cannot understand anything by rationality because it is so limited.

So if you have to go to the unlimited regions you have to be triggered out into that place and the triggering force is this Kundalini. This Kundalini is placed in the triangular bone in the sacrum. Sacrum. means sacred. People knew perhaps that it is a sacred bone so they called it sacred. It's long. 

You see, interesting, isn't it? This word has come to us from ... Greeks and Greeks knew that it was sacred bone. Otherwise why should they call it a sacred bone. So this triangular bone hides this  power within it and when you come to Sahaja Yoga, a sign, that it pulsates.  You can see the pulsation. You can make  it out.  You can  see the rising of  the pulsation with your naked eye.  And you can  see the breaking also of your fontanel bone - the  baptism which is promised, the real  baptism.  Not in the church or not in  any temple, but the real one  is a happening within you, is a really happening that has to take place.  It has to be done by living  God It's not  that somebody just  comes und ....  puts his hand on the head and says, "You are born again" or he says that, "All right you have become a Christian." It's a happening, just like that. Now a realised soul is called as a person who is twice born. Everybody is saying, "I am twice born." But what’s the proof that you are a twice born person. And then there must be some fundamental proof about it that you are twice born. It's nice to say I am twice born and self-certificate, you yourself just self-certificate that yes I'm twice born. But there must be some method to find out. And if you think that twice born is such a great thing why not have it. It's a very simple thing.

One has to understand that if you are created on this earth from amoeba to this state there must be some fundamental reason for it. We are not just created just to be here and to live like human beings without understanding the depths of God's creation. How can that be? Why has He made us human beings? Is it just to have some money in the insurance company or to pay the house or have a property and then to die? Is that the reason we are here? No. We are here to know the working of God's love and his Divine power and to manoeuver it; to be an instrument of God and His part and parcel; to know that you are the part and parcel of His being. To be aware of that. Not just talking. That we are all brothers and sisters and we should not fight and there is .. only one personality within us. It's only talking. It's not bla, bla, bla, but it is a thing that happens within. You become that, you cannot get our of it and you know that you are That. It's the actualisation I am talking about.

Now when this Kundalini rises through these varios centres it pierces through this fontanele bone area. And it has to pierce through that fantanele bone area. If it does not pierce then you are not yet realised. This is what is the thing called as self-realised or twice born. Like an egg you can say a human being is made. He is an egg because he is covered with his ego and superego on his head. Throug his left and right sympathetic nervous system. And now he is completely covered and closed. When he is ready the Kundalini rises and transforms him into a new bird. That's what it is. It's the second birth. That's why a Wija means a Brahmin. The one who is a realised soul is a Brahmin. The one who has known the Brahman, the Brahma is called a Brahmin, and he is the one who is twice born. He cannot be born. He has to be realised. He has to be twice born otherwise he is not a Brahmin.

So even in  India we have a  ritual as you have here  of baptisms, we have  a ritual.   But that  is also  a ritual,and  a ritual  makes no difference.  Now the same thing is called, is a Wija.  Means
the one who is twice born. Now that twice born is also a bird. A
bird is also called a Wija because it is born twice and a human
being is also called a Wija if he is a self realised person or a Brahmin, Brahmin in the real sense.
So this has to happen to us within us. If it does not happen no use giving yourself certificate to yourself. Now, for example, if I say I am the Queen of England, will I become, will you become just by giving the certificate to yourself? I mean people may put you in the prison or in the lunatic asylum. So like that, are you doing anything; by your own imagination you do not. What we are to become is what you are talking about and that has to happen within us.
Now this  happening is a  living happening as  I told you  because in this  short time  I cannot  tell you  all the  details but  there are Chakras  and all  these things  you can  see from  the books  and the things you have been....  Have you given them some papers and things? Not yet.  You should have given  these things ...  All right, you can get all that and find out what all these Chakras are.
But I just want to tell you about how it's a living thing. For example, now this flower is here. Now if you want this flower to become a fruit. What do you do? .. Nothing, you don't do anything. There's no technique. Supposing you are a flower and you have to become the fruit, what do you do? What techniques are there? ...
It's a living process, it takes care of itself. At the most it has
to face the sun, that's all, to get the light. If it gets the light, all right, it becomes, automatically.
It is to be connected with the tree and it must get the light. It will happen automatically, spontaneously. This is what is the meaning of Sahaja. Sahaja means born with you. The, the flower it is born the right to become a fruit, Sahaja. And Yoga means your connection with the Divine. So Sahaja Yoga means you are born with the right to be connected with the Divine. And that is your right which you must have and that you are going to get.
Now the times are very precarious, I must tell you. These are the times of last judgment. It has started. The last judgment has started. You
won't believe. That's why thousands of people are seeking
and ... being born. There are many little realised children I see who are born realised who are born just for the Last Judgment.
The maximum will be born during this time because they are to be judged. That's why population growth is so big. All of them born to be judged but they don<t know why they are born. Before taking birth they know but now they have forgotten.
So the Last Judgment has started and you will be judged every minute. But the way we understand judgment is very wrong. First of all, how are we going to be judged? Done, Is there any judge going to sit down and do it for you; every individual human being? There has to be
judge within us. Everyone must have the judge within us and that judge is this Kundalini. She is the one she knows what you have done. She is the tape recorder of what you have done. And she is a very fine, very very fine judge because She is your Mother. And you are her child. Your Kundalini is your own Mother. She has no other child. So She is so concerned about you. She is so bothered about you that She knows all about you and She knows how to give you your rebirth. She's just waiting for that. So it is your own within yourself. You have got this power called as Kundalini which is so compassionate, so considerate and so delicate and so dedicated to you, so loving that you don't have to worry about her.
She rises by  herself but she indicates what are  your problems, what problems are  to be solved.  And  that has to be  done, somehow these problems are to be solved before  you get your realisation.  When She rises She  starts indicating.   Not to  you, of  course, not  to you, because you  are not  yet realised.   Your awareness  is not  at that point.  But those who are realised souls can feel it on their fingers because once you get your realisation  you get all your Chakras, your centres, enlightened on  your fingers.  And you can  feel then what's happening to another person.  You  can immediately feel it.  How that person  is, what's  happening, where  is  he catching.   What is  the problem, what centre is catching.  And you can raise the Kundalini if you are  a realised soul.   And you  can give realisation.   And once they get their realisation they  can give also realisation to others, like you  get your  realisation you can  give realisation  to others. And like from one light enlightening another light, it goes on.

What is the technique for enlightening a candle to another candle? .. Nothing. You just touch this candle to that. There is no technique about it. First thing we have to know there is no technique, it is effortless, absolutely effortless. There is no technique whatsoever. If you understand this point you have understood most of it. There is no technique. When there is no technique, nothing of the kind, no human effort, nothing that is human is required, it is Divine. Then you cannot pay for it. You cannot pay for such a thing. It's an insult to think that you can pay for it. How can you pay for birth? What can you pay? What ever for? Even whatever you give to Him is His own and this money business is your own. It is not God's God never created money. It's your own style. This human beings have got this money here, possessions and all that. That's your headache. That's not the thing that God has created. It's human beings, they have created all these things, so they have to deal with money and they have to worry about it. But you cannot pay for it.

Anybody who takes any money from you, run away from that person. Such person cannot be a holy person. It's all right you have to take this hall. It's all right you can take 10p each from everyone and take the hall. That's all. Because for the hall you have to pay. But for your realisation and for your vibrations you cannot. You don't have to pay to the person who gives you realisation. Such a person cannot give you realisation because he is incapable. He is a parasite. So you cannot pay for it. You cannot have effort. And the third thing when you fall into is that through your rationality you cannot reach. It is a step beyond. Rationality can explain everything for some people. While there are some people who say "what's wrong?" They rob bank, "What's wrong" Everything, "What's wrong?", "what's wrong?" What's wrong" 

But after realisation everything becomes logical. There's difference between logic an rationality. Everything becomes logical and understandable because you see with your own eyes what's happened. Now we  have many centres  within us about which  I won't be  able to tell you in this short time.  But I will tell you about one, which is the  Agnya Chakra  which is  very important,  is here.   This is  the centre of Christ.   Most of us here from Christianity.   I don't know how they call it.  If you ask  them where is Christ, He is within us; now where?  Where is He?  In what part of our body does He exist?  Do you know that?   How to achieve Him?   How to reach Him?   How to get connected?  Are we connected with Him?  By just calling Him, "Christ, Christ," will He come? There are many also such people I know, they say "I am Christ." Now if you are Christ, please walk on this water. That's the best way to find them out. All these tricks are known. Only one thing he has to know, "Are you connected with Christ?" By any chance, are you? Definitely are you? What's the proof?

Now I'll tell you what is the proof, how to find out. When the Kundalini rises she may stop here at this point. It is at the centre of the brain where optic chasma crosses each other. The brain is a subtle centre which controls your pituitary and the pineal body. And that is a subtle centre where Christ resides. When the Kundalini crosses all other centres and comes here and stops then you have to take the name of Christ. Not you but the person who is giving you realisation. You have to call him. You have to forgive people first of all. By forgiveness at that point you become thoughtlessly aware because Christ has done all the thinking for us, we don't have to think. Do we realise that? All of this generations who are known for their thinking power should know that they are not Christian if they are thinking. And one work. Christ has done for them. And what is there to suffer when he has suffered for us? Now what remains. What are you going to do?

Another madness we have, say in French people especially. They told me that, "Mother, they can see you are so happy they won't believe it. They'll think it's naive to be happy." I said, "Really. Why?" They said because the problems are so many, so you should be absolutely a very unhappy person. From your expression you should seem. Ugh! And all sorts of things. I said, "Really, you have to look really miserable. Otherwise I said, "That's why .... .... in France. I said, "You are miserable, you, what there has been. What, what is there to be miserable. You have so much money. You have exploited so many people in the whole world. What more do you want? To be happy? You have done whatever was possible. You have ruined your life.

You are so licentious, so permissive. You have all kinds of things .. to spoil yourself, to ruin yourself and destroy yourself. Now what more do you want to destroy yourself and that you are miserable. It's very nice to ask a bull to come and hit me and then say I am miserable. You will be miserable the way you are going about. You don't do preserve yourself. You don't want to look after yourself. And what are you miserable about? But now you have understood then. Now they are all right. I said it's a myth. You have just created a drama. You see they are dramatists. Make a drama and very miserable for what? Because of the nuclear weapons. I said, "What about you? You are yourself is having the atomic bomb, and exploding within yourself. It is worrying you every minute. Why are you miserable? What is there to be miserable? I don't understand." And this is what it is. That human beings themselves have created lots of problems within themselves. And these problems spoil your ascent. It's rather difficult for Kundalini to rise when you have spoilt your ascent. Now that also has to be corrected. That has to be done. It has to be done.

Now it's my fate that I have to do it. I am sorry but I have to do it. Now many people have an opposition for that also. They say, "Why you Mother?" I say, "Please correct it. I'll be very happy. Because I have been doing this now add days together and nights together better than you do it. If you can do it I'll be very happy. I'll be the happiest person who are a disciple if you can do it. To be very frank, that's the best thing that can happen to me. Sometime, if somebody could take my place. Thus I find it impossible. So why objekt to it? All this is coming to ask you to uncover yourself, ego, superego, all this. So we have to know that we have to get our realisation. We have to get it. That's the main thing. We must get it and then you must understand it logically with an open mind. 

Whatever is said about our realisation, since times immemorial, you can say that ancient times in India they have been talking about it. Then after Christ, Mohomatsa, everyone has said that you have to become. Become. They were not all false people that were talking about it. Even if scientists deny them doesn't mean that they were wrong. But the time has come to prove all that, all the scriptures, everything that is said. And you the Seekers, you are the people who are going to get it. You are the Saints who have been seeking and have been promised that in modern times, called as Kali Yuga, you are going to get your realisation. The main problem about Sahaja Yoga is that it is so spontaneous, it works so spontaneously that people get it and settle down like an "Oh, what an experience." And then they settle down. No. You have to learn, you have to master it, you have to work it out. Because a light which is enlightened, you have to give light to others. Why should God keep it moving. He is a sensible man. The light which doesn't give any light, say on the seashore or on anyone of these lighthouses; if the light is not needed you .. don't need the lighthouse. So if you do not agree to give it to others and learn and master this, for no money at all, for nothing at all you become the master. Then you use it.

Yesterday I came up to this programme. There was a Muslim boy who had come to me, by the way, and he said when he saw me, and said," I don't know why but the thought came to me. Will I see Mother here?"

I said, "Why didn't you come and see me?" He said, " I felt that if I come to Mother how am I going to study for my exams and this and that and that's what I thought. "I said, "Really, you become so dynamic that you can pass your exams without any difficulties. You really become so alert. Why did you think like that?" He said, "And the experience was so great that for fifteen days I was just lost in the experience and after that I thought and now I think it's gone down. It's very much lower and the vibrations are extremely feeble and I cannot feel it now. This is after six months in getting it but I don't know where I got this feeling." But I said, "What do you think about the rest of the people? What about collectivity? What do you think about the people who are seeking? He said, "I am thinking about all the fanatics these Muslims, absolute fanatics." The Christans are also very fanatic, no doubt, but Muslims are a different type of fanatic. I said, "Then what about them?." "Yes I am thinking about them that we young people have to now get up and say that Islam's nonsence. Now I find the vibrations." I said, "When are you going to do that?" He said, "I'm fed up with the exams. I'm going to do it now." I said, "There's no need to get fed up of your exams, you get ... with your exams. And you have to do this work. This is your job. You are a realised soul and you have to do it. We had one person from Algeria who came and got his realisation. These are Muslims as well. He went back and gave realisation to five hundert people. And they are all young professors, lecturers, architects and what do you call the, chartered accountants; all this kind of people who are rich bit. Five hundred Muslims who are people who have got realisation from one person. And now near me is who feels, who feels ashamed the way Muslims are, the people are fanatic but he cannot go about it. All over the world the young people are in the stand of fanaticism. They see arround them such fanatics among Hindus, Christians, Muslims, Parsees, Sikhs, Buddhists, all of them such fantic people. How can there be a different God? Just think about it. It has to be done.

These are all flowers on one living tree and we take them out from there and we call them our own. They are dying...... We can see it's so ugly, it's so horrible. Some are indulging into violences; some are indulging into some story of love; this nonsense, that nonsense and that is all sorts of nonsensical things they are talking. And that is why you have to fight it out. It's something that is sick. All this nonsense has to be fought out. You know how many there are. We have had people from all various groups new here. Some were ..... I don't know if some were flying. They've got bankrupts flying in the air. I said, "Why not ask the Guru to fly?" It would have been better. If he was flying then it was all right to fly with them, but he never flew, flew for you. So why did you pay so much when you maybe can come to be bankrupt their children starving, they are in the street, and they have suffered so from flying. I said, "Why do you want fly. By the way you are not going to become birds are you?" There are some again who are jumping like frogs. I said, "What is this?" Those are, "The Kundalini's awakened and that's why we're jumping like frogs." I said, "Are you not going to become frogs?" Use your brains, "I said, "Are you going to become frogs now?" And some people who had taken out their clothes and dancing around and I said, "What is this nonsense?" I said, "By taking out clothes if you are going to be realised then most of the animals will be first before you. "And use your brains. You have to use your brains to understand all this kind of nonsense that's going on. A person who asks for a thing, a Rolls-Royce. He says I must have a Rolls- Royce if I am coming to England. ..... is the best place is that ... How can you believe such man who asks first a Rolls-Royce from you? He is a parasite of the worst type. What is he doing to you that you are mesmerised. You cannot see. When nothing is logical then it is mesmerism. Hum .... 

Every day I meet somone I know of a new nonsense in man. Any technique. Supposing, Eka heard one of them say, a criminal from England. So I come to England, somehow or other escape from there and come down here and wear a dress, a funny dress, you see. Maybe with a, with a, some sort of a ... What did you see today coming out, Barbara, on the head?  Some type sort of spokes she said was coming out you see from the head. Now, and you sit down in the middle of a square and you say, "I am such and such a guru. I am great and I am coming from the Himalayas and everybody starts saying it. And then you say, "All right, I'll tell you what to do. You are to hold your nose with one hand and close your mouth well, after me." So he says you can't do it safely for more than a second or two seconds and .... no .. and that is because of your Kurma Karmas. Because you have done all wrong in previous lives that you cannot hold. You must try to hold your breath." .... And people will start doing it. You will find within one month there will be a hundred people, then you will one day end up with about ten thousand foolish stupid people who will declare now, "I am sitting without breath." This sounds wrong. We have to know that it has to be all very logical.

And we have before us great people, Christ, Moses. All these people are before us in the Western countries. We have others. We have Nanika, we have Kabira. We have so many people who come on this Earth to show us what is to expext. Adi Shankaracharya, the greatest of greatest, who was born in India, who has, who is supposed to have propogated Hinduism because Hindus don't follow him. They read something else. They never read him. That is the main point, point; they never read him. There are very few Hindus I have met who have read who Shankaracharya. Surprising! They are supposed to be Hindus. They never read him. They only read Gita ... Gita written by x,y,z. Gita written by this and that. Even in Gita they have tried to change so many things und bring in so many problems. Same in every scripture they have tried all kinds of tricks just to make it available for them. And this you will know very soon when you will become realised. That they have tried to change this just to have it, a kind of a, exlusively for themselves because they want to prove that they are the chosen ones, they are the highest, they are somebody. Just as a self appointment. And then Christ has said, "You will be calling me, Christ, Christ, and I won't recognise." That's what it is.

By putting your name as Christian you do not become. You are Christians? You have to have the real baptism and that's an experience, that's a happening that happens to you and you feel that the breeze of the Holy Ghost starts flowing to. Why it should happen? Otherwise what is the baptism? You really feel the breeze coming out of your head. If you do not feel then it has to be worked out. But you have to feel it that way. To be opened out that the breeze from inside, the strong is manifesting, is coming out of your head, you can feel it clearly. That should happen. Those who are honest and truthful will understand and also you have to be intelligent to understand. Stupid people cannot stick on into Sahaja Yoga. They go out of circulation very soon. Stupidity is not allowed in Sahaja Yoga. It's not meant for stupid people.

It's meant for people who are alert, who want to have realisation and establish themselves. Afterwards as a result you get your health all right. Your helth is cured in the sense that you feel physically very fit. Many diseases can be cured. So many incurable diseases have been cured with the awakening of the Kundalini. But the Kundalini has to pay. If she does not then you won't get the blessings so full. Now, the first thing is that you must know that you have not come here for physical sickness or for anything but for realisation. Your attention has to be on your spirit. If it is not there what is the use of being in England just a .... If there is a light which is not going to give light, you are not going to be fed. You are not interested. I mean very simple common sense. And the, the Divine power has a lot of common sense. When this power starts flowing through you, you will be amazed, that you know so many things to it. You can feel it sitting down here. What is that in any particular person. You can know about yourself. You can know about others. You can also know what is the matter with your Kundalini. It's there. And how to raise it, how to work it out. How to give realisation to others. Everything you can know but you have patience with yorself. That's the thing I find people lack. They have no patience with themselves. I have tremendous patience, but they don't have. They give up, they just can't work it out. It works out very fast. Once you become diamond, like you become a human being. You are born as a human being. But if you are ... you become an animal. You behave like an animal with a human body. That's what happens. After realisation you have to keep the company of the Saints, of the sad generates of the gopi. If you keep the company of bad people they will dominate you because in the beginning you are just a child, you are a little child. You are so delicate. You have to handle yourself very carefully especially in the seven days after realisation it is very important to establish. That's what you are seeking. In whatever you are doing keeping doing with the Saints, you are a Seeker. Nothing wrong with it. Anything that you are doing genuinely, is nothing but your seeking and is destructed but you understand where you have to go and the way you have to do it. Everything is solved so sweetly.

Second thing that happens to you that actualises upon your self respect, when all of yor addictions stop. So many of them who have been alcoholics, absolutely horrible alcoholics; you can say they were in coma when they come to me. One gentleman had a cirrhosis of liver, another he come to me, those who were drug eddicts, and the whole sap who had been to goal and all that, have got rid of it; absolutely because once you are upon yor back you are not going to benefit, you are not going to change all yourself the best. Your are not so much bothered and that enjoyment liftss you all, that you drop out from all these things automatically. I don't tell anybody don't drink. I don't tell them anything, only get your realisation than that's it, because no use telling them before. It's too much. It is a brainwash. That's no good. You must. It must happen from within. Since it happens, you yourself will give up smoking, you just give up. You don't want to smoke. Then it is so bad that in the company of Sahaja Yogis, even if there may be thousands, you cannot find one matchbox to light the candle. So I always tell them ... Take one match box because that's important. From thousands of people, and thousands of people could be there and there won't be a matchbox. It's a most surprising thing.

Now I could just tell you that these advantages as .... I'm tellung you are not so important. The main thing is you are not to achieve. You must realise it. That's the most important thing is. The third thing is that happens to you that mentally you get feeling satisfied with yourself. Absolutely satisfied and you enjoy yourself. The subtle thing that starts is that you glow with dignity. The whole behaviour is, becomes so dignified and you start feeling that you are so beautiful. How can you insult yourself by doing this? You just start growing automatically. You become a very very dignified magnetic personality. Not hypnotic but magnetic. The love starts growing through your heart. 

Some people have been hard people, their heart's difficult to open, but 99 percent it works out. One percent maybe, they are difficult but they can work it out and also open their heart. All these things can happen. As a result of your mental balances and things you become a dynamically brilliant intelligent person. The things you start seeing are surprising. For example, there was a gentleman who came to me from India who had no job. He came to me and he said, "What job should I do, Mother?" I said, "Why don't you start doing some interior decorating." He Said, "What? I don't know. I don't understand. How am I to do it?" I said, "You just start it with vibrations," and he is now a very rich man in the sense that he's made a good money. But you don't become very good's like Forte. There are no extremes in Sahaja Yoga. It's just another sense, to be satisfied.

You are to share everything and enjoy. We really do not want to have too much. The want within disappears and the desire to have more disappears. You are very satisfied and you don't judge your attention to go aesthetically rich things than to something that shows off your properties and your money and which is in competition, something regarded as something high. For example, instead of going for a Rolls-Royce you may go for a beautiful vase which is very beautifully done. You see your attention moves off for a something, a beautiful picture of Christ, or something like that which is .. the Divine. I mean your whole priorities change with that and you become a different person, a beautiful person. That has to happen.

But as I said, doing anything, that after realisation you have to become. All effort has to be put in after realisation, not before realisation. For example, if a power has to come you have to put to the mains. You put to the mains. And when the balance comes, then only, you manoeuvre. Before the balance springs what are you manoeuvering. It's just moving your hands this way that like in a show. But when it is flowing through your hands you have to know how to manoeuvre it, how to adjust it, how to move the vibrations, how to raise it. And all these things you have to learn and also to master it within yourself.

Then another thing that has happened, very much here, and there are some people who have been blessed by that, is that you get rid of your mental problems, mental disease. I am not saying intelligence but those people who are suffering from any kind of, eh, lunacy or ... ism or possessions or epilepsies and things like that of a very serious nature. There's a bit, girl here who have very serious, very very serious epilepsy and she used to get into it for three hours. After realisation she got rid of it. So all these things can get all right if you establish your realisation all such things. Everyone these days I see, I think is confused in these modern time. Confusion is the real, atmosphere of modern times. The confusion, confusion clears out because the light is there.

In this world if there is no light there will, there will be confusion. But if there is light you just see everything so clearly that you know where is what, who is sitting where. In the same way it happens within you. Your enlightenment is nothing but the light of your spirit in your heart has to be enlightened. Through this Kundalini rising, when it is enlightened you can see it in through your heart and not through your brain. But then you understand it through your brain because it is logical and you are amazed the way things work out. Apart from this I would say the greatest thing happens to you that you achieve your collective consciousness. You achieve. It is an actualisation. It becomes within you. You become conscious of it. Like if you take a horse through a dirty lane he won't feel bad, he'll just pass through without any problem. The man who is standing in it will have a problem, will have to close his nose, or he'll have to close his eyes; he cannot walk through. Why? Because it is in him. His sensitivity is much more than that of a horse.

In the same way, if I tell you that this is not good, this is not, this is against your sustainance, it will be sinful you won't believe. It is not proper, you won't like it because you think that I am conditioning you. But after realisation the light comes so much in you that you know it is sin because you cannot bear, you don't like it. It tastes different you. You become a person of a very higher taste. Automatically you don't like such people who talk such things and you do not want to indulge into alle these things; and it just becomes a new awareness in which you start understanding the beauty of pure light, of purity, of totality, and you start understanding it better when you realise that you have become a part and parcel of the whole. With that we can know, so many things. I cannot tell you because now these people have got three hundred times and I don't know how many times more I have to repeat now; then I am going to India and then to Australia, then back again to America. It's going to be quite a long talking journey.

But now for you the best is to get realisation. In this short time whatever was possible love tried to explain to you, but through arguments you are not going to get it. It has to happen. If you argue with me you are not going to get it. There is no need to argue. If it doesn't  work out it will not work out. By arguing you will not get it. But how will you get in by getting moody? There is no other way out, you have to get it. 
Is it all right or do you want to ask any questions?
A few sentences in Hindi?

Member of audience "Can I ask a question? How can a Guru who says they can give you knowledge, who is the power, of all knowledges." Better to see their disciples. "Pardon" Better to see their disciples and know if they are in the knowledge. You see the best way proof of the pudding is in the eating of it. All right? Should go and see their disciples. Have they got any knowledge? For example, there is one I know who says he gives knowledge. And they have a restaurant here now, they have a restaurant to give knowledge and they are supposed to be getting knowledge. Now when somebody from Sahaja Yoga went to see them they started shaking, and all that happened. So they said and why are you shaking. "Oh, the guru Maharaj is going to do for us." All right, so we said, "What about Kundaliniß" He said, "Who is going to do it for us? Who is going to raise the Kundaliniß" That they have spent so much, they have just sold out. I mean they have not achieved it at all. What kind of a knowledge is this, that you cannot manoeuvre, you cannot say where you are, you cannot raise the Kundalini, you cannot do anything. Useless people. They are just hypocritics in self-knowledge. What do you call selfknowledge? That you try to drive the car I would say all right, Mataji won't drive. Is it knowledge? It cannot be known. Just think like that. It's hypnosis. Absolute hypnosis. To say that somebody else is going to do it for you. You know how to do it, you have to do it for yourself. Now remember they don't know what is Kundalini. Even if they know, they don't know how to raise the Kundalini. They don't know how to check what is within us, what is wrong with us. They don't know anything. Like I asked somebody who come to me from this T.M. business ... I don't want to criticise anyone as some of them are here .... And I said, "Well, what is happening to you? I mean you are spending money for years together, you have given them somewhere for ten years it's serious ... madness. Why did you come here?" He said, "There was like a, we walked into a blanket and we didn't know where to move. It was all darkness. We did not know where to go. There was no way of guessing how to understand." This is it. What is knowledge?

Except for self-knowledge there is not other knowledge to be known. Except for God there is not other knowledge to be known. The garden is for you. That is to be known to your self. You should be able to know how to move, hov to use your powers. What is the use of somebody who say "I have so many powers." So what. What about us? Have you got any powers? Now here there are so many Sahaja Yogis. You can see them and you can find out that they have the knowledge. They will tell you what's wrong with you, what's going wrong with you and what's happening. And this kind of hypnosis, I'd say with this awful one are not useful personally. You see, slavish people can only follow the leader. Here we want you to be absolutely free. You are allowed to ask every question. Then nobody asks! They just jump in. First you pay a hundred pounds before I'm telling you to; that style you see. And not to ask any questions. They sit there on the seventh floor.

But I'm your Mother. You can ask me questions. Your freedom is the very thing. If you do not have freedom how are you going to be able to enter into the Kingdom of God? Just tell me. This is all hypnosis. 

Member of audience "Is it possible that some people who are not suited to Kundalini meditation?"

Very probably, yes. So far I have not seen any. I mean I go on working for days together. It's all right for me now everybody is absolutely.... They say so because we had one Yogi Mahajan in ... he came. He himself is a guru, so he came to Me and I gave him realisation. He accepts Me as The One and all that and .. then I told him, "What are you doing about it." He said, "Mother, some of them are not suitable." I said, "You leave it to Me. Better start giving them realisation. Don't you worry." And he was amazed. He said, "In ... there are twenty-five people coming and a great ego was building up." Is he giving them realisation or not? I said, "You just try." "If you are a Seeker do you think the compassion of God will not give them realisation?" God is the ocean of love. You are facing the ocean. What are these small things when, what mistakes can you commit, what sins can you commit before the ocean? All right?

Member of audience,"Yes thank you."

Now. Any more questions? One more we can ask, anybody I said. There. Member of audience "Mr. Benjamin Creme, do you know of his works?" No, I don't know. Is this, what does he do?

M of A "At the moment he's lecturing about the return of Christ."
He lectures on What? "The Return of Christ". All, They are lecturing about him. There's no end to that. What-s the use? Will they recognize Christ? How will you recognize Christ? We can ask him. Go and ask him a simple question. "Sir, Benjamin, what's his name, can you recognize Christ when he comes?". Just ask him a very, very simple question my child. He won't be able to recognize. How will you recognize? Really, which is the way God look? You have no vibrations coming out. You have to have vibratory awareness to know if it's Christ. Otherwise how will you recognize. But this time he is not going to be identified. Neither is he going to give you realisation. He's just going to sort out. He's coming in, you see, in other forms.
All, in the destructive powers that usually are called Ekadasha Rudra. He's going to come in that form. And he's not going to talk to you or to convince people. He's just going to sort you out. That's what it is - the Last Judgment. They never recognized him before. It's all right. That's how he said that anything said against Me will be forgiven because they did not realise. That's how you are ..... But now there is realisation and he said, "Anything against the Holy Ghost it will not be forgiven." There are so many people these days in the market who can't do it. With Sahaja Yoga they can. You only have to take something, not to give. You have come here to take. You just experience it, mentally, and know that by thinking you did not get it. Do not think about it but absorb it more and more, absorb it more and more. That's your own power within yourself. It is unknown to you today. It is called as an Unconscious. It is called as Universal Unconscious. Becomes conscious. That you start feeling it on the central nervous system. Is it all right now?

Did I tell you that we need so many people? How many people have I? Best thing is to know yourself. What is the use of knowing the whole ... and not knowing if it is correct. You'll see Christ realise better than that gentleman, I can tell you, once you get your realisation, all right? As, so we are ready. All right. May God bless you.

Do you think it is very cold? Is it very cold conditions. It is, all right? Now just take out your shoes and you can put your hands on your ...  It makes no difference. But you all have to promise, that if I give you realisation you are going to persevere. That's promised, yes. Otherwise I am not going to  give you realisation, because in England it's happened, people are so funny.  They frizzle out for nothing at  all and then they meet me after nine months, nine months from somewhere you see. "Mother, I've lost this ..... "Then I feel so bad about it you see, that if the attention of the Divine it disappears from you, everything can happen. You have to be in the attention of the divine, isn't it? Then Divine looks after you. And then you see the blessings of the Divine.

All right, please put your eyes shut and close your eyes, close your eyes. First thing that happens to you when the Kundalini crosses the Agnya, you feel there is no thought within. You just feel it yourself. You'll have to vertify yourself. Everyday you have to judge yourself and I'm not going to say. You see for yourself. "Is there any thought?" Ask your mind, "Are you thinking? What are you thinking"
 Ask your mind yourself. You have to judge it yourself.
