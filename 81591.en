It's a bit weird because we got our Realization in 1978 and attended the Birmingham meeting from '78 to '79. We were going just once a week to the meditation, and to be honest, it was extremely weird. We didn't know about puja; we didn't know much about Shri Mataji. We would arrive at this meeting and meditate for an hour or two in front of a picture and a candle. Nobody spoke to us or said anything much, and what I did hear was them arguing at the back. We used to think, "Well, if this is it, we're not that keen on going."

I never had a problem with Shri Mataji, and I knew that wasn't part of her. This was some church-going thing where everybody was backbiting. So I knew Shri Mataji wasn't part of that, but the crew were, and I was completely put off by it. There were also a couple of other weird things happening. They weren't telling us anything about the chakra system. We didn't know anything about puja or much more about Shri Mataji. We were never given tapes, books, or literature. Somehow we managed to do this for 12 months. If anybody asked, you'd think we were utter little lunatics.

We dropped out for a while and then came back in '82. I remember going to the meeting again at Birmingham. We had one baby by then. A couple of things from that meeting: again, I was kind of bamboozled by Shri Mataji just talking. I was thinking, "Well, she shouldn't just talk like this without saying, 'I think it's like this,' or 'I think it's like that.'" She just went for it, and I was always shocked by that. She'd just say, "It is like this," and you'd be thinking, "Okay, fair enough."

At the end of it, I took the kids up to Shri Mataji and asked if she would bless them. You've got to bear in mind, I'm not from a family that goes to church. I haven't a clue about any kind of religion or religious faiths. So I'm thinking, to take the kids to be blessed by Shri Mataji... you're kind of doing things that you don't know why you're doing them, in a funny way. Mother said, "I don't need to bless them. They're both realized souls." I thought, "What does that mean?" I'm walking off thinking, "What does that mean?" It was all strange to me.

The whole thing about me going to a meeting and meditating was strange. I didn't know what I was doing there. When she said something, I didn't know why she said it. I didn't know I was "realized" or what that meant, but I was carrying on doing these things. And of course, I didn't have a clue that there was anybody in London doing these things. I just thought there were just half a dozen of us in Birmingham. I didn't know Mother was doing programs at Caxton Hall; I didn't know she was doing this, that, and the other.

(The speaker's partner begins to talk)

In '82, we went to see Shri Mataji at Dr. Johnson's house in Birmingham. I've always had chronic asthma, since I was young. I was obsessed with getting rid of it. I'd seen all the homeopaths, osteopaths—I'd seen everybody in the universe. So I thought Shri Mataji could probably get rid of this. I found out she was at this house, so I sussed it out and blagged my way in.

I waited for a long time. It was a room a little bigger than this, I think, and I was sat at the back against the wall, listening to Mother. Again, I didn't know what she was talking about, seriously. I was hearing the words, but I didn't know what she was talking about. It was the same wherever she spoke. I thought, "Yeah, it makes sense, but I don't know what she's talking about." It's kind of contradictory, isn't it? It's eating you on a deeper level.

So I sat at the back, waited for a long while, then crept forward and said, "Shri Mataji, I've got chronic asthma. Can you help me?" She was talking to everybody in a normal way, and she just said, "Hold my feet." So I'm holding her feet on my center heart like this, and she's talking to everybody else and having a cup of tea. I'm thinking I'm completely baffled because Mother's just carrying on as if I'm not there. So I'm just holding her feet, and suddenly I hear this—literally like a stick breaking. That was it.

The only thing that happened was it did take away the asthma, but by the time I left the building, I was back in my asthmatic head. Does that make sense? I didn't think it was possible, so I went back to having asthma, which I still have. Weird.

So, we had seen Mother last in about 1982. I'm not seeing much of Mother or Sahaja Yogis anyway. We were attending that meeting in Birmingham. Actually, Francis forced me to go because I was going off the rails. I was a bit of a... whatever I was. I was always on the go. Francis said I needed to go to meditation, and I agreed, to keep the marriage together and all that. But I was a nutter.

I agreed to keep meditating. As Francis said, we didn't really know much about Sahaja Yoga. We never saw Mother, didn't know all these things were happening in London, didn't know how to meditate, and didn't have any information on chakras or anything. We stopped going for ten years after the children were born.

Then I had the flu—or man flu, for the ladies here—and I was laid on the settee. I had the tape from that '82 session, and I put it in the recorder. I was just laid on the settee listening to it, and something happened to me.

When Francis got home, I said, "I know you won't be able to tell because I'm not painted blue or whatever, but I've become the Spirit." I said, "I don't even know what that is, but you can ask me any question you want about religion or anything, and I will tell you the answer. I just know everything. I just know I am the Spirit. Just ask me anything you want."

It was really remarkable. I had serious asthma; I was using one of those sprays 20 times a day. And the asthma went for three weeks, just like that. All kinds of things happened in that week. I don't really want to embarrass myself, but I was able to control the elements. I knew what people were thinking. If somebody was going to say something, I knew what they were going to say before they said it. There were lots and lots of little things.

The biggest thing that happened was I was incredibly humble, which I'm not normally. But I just felt incredibly humble. And the other thing is, at that point, I knew who Shri Mataji was. Because I thought, "If I can do all these things, what is Shri Mataji?" I was just blown away. I just thought, "My God, if this is me and I can do these things, what does Shri Mataji do?" And that was when I realized who Shri Mataji was.
