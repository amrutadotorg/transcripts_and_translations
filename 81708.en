I bow to all the seekers of truth. I bow because I see the category of seeking written large on your face. And you have been seeking for ages the truth. And as you have heard doctor Warren, he also went through all kinds of seekings in his life, and he was really frustrated. And he felt there is nothing like truth, nothing would do the same for the sake of truth. Truth is there, but it manifests in its own time, in its own course. It has to be understood that we do not understand truth through our mental projections or through our emotional projections, all other things that we do which we can do as human beings.

As he is describing to you other methods and things like that, we should be honest to ourselves and kind to ourselves, because we are seekers of ages, and this seeking has to be fulfilled. We should not try to plays around with words, with misidentifications. Even some people say, "Mother, we have paid money to this particular person, so we must go ahead with it". This kind of a superficial attitude or a frivolous attitude or a kind of a wrongly adjusted attitude, has to be brought to normal thing. There has to be the truth as there has been many prophets, many incarnations, great personalities who talked of truth. None of them took any money, did not have any Rolls Royces, did not live on the earnings of the people whom they talked to. They were self-respecting, glorious people. They believed that they could talk to people, they could communicate with them.

But you found that it was so difficult. People were so conditioned. Whenever they wanted to talk to someone, they found that they were confronted with people who were so conditioned by some sort of a money-oriented organisations. Like the Jews wanted to crucify Christ. For what? What did He do to them? Did He do any wrong? Nothing. Why? Because they were identified with a wrong type of ideology that they could not accept Christ who has suffered for them. They have to suffer themselves, otherwise they cannot go to God. This is just a misunderstanding about God’s wishes and his ways. Why will He want you to suffer? He is not a cruel God to his own children. So, you must suffer! And you know the Jews suffered.

If you ask for something, you get it. In India, the custom is to fast. They fast and fast. I mean, if you ask them on 8 days, out of the week, they fast at least for five days. And we have fasting going on automatically in our country. You don’t ask for miseries. If you ask for miseries, you’ll get miseries. But if you ask for blessings, God gives you blessings. He’s kind, the kindest of all. He is the source of joy. He is the source of all that is blissful, of peace, and of that greatness and nobility about which we have heard.

Now, to understand yourself, first of all you must know that you are all seekers. And you are seekers of truth. Don’t run after something that is not yet the truth. That is one thing I have to tell you. Shri Krishna described very well, about six thousand years back, the three types of permutations and combinations that are formed in human beings.
The first ones are the ‘tamasikas’, are the people who run after something that is wrong. They stick on to it, emotional people, they fall in love with one woman, they’ll waste all their life falling in love with one woman . This life is so precious. This human life is made out of so many tribulations, such care, such gentle handling. You have no idea as to how you are made from amoeba to this stage. And at this stage, to come and suddenly take your ego into your hands and try to do what you like is absurd.

The second type of people are the ones who are the ‘rajasikas’, those who live with ego-orientation, with the ego prompting. Like they form an organization, "All right, this is my organization. I am great, this is my race, I am a special being, this, that". Self-opinionated and hypocritical. And they don’t know what is right and what is wrong. They are harming themselves unnecessarily and harming others without being aware of it.Like, in London, we have something called 'punk' and they also came to my program. And the Sahaja Yogis were rather worried about them. I said, "Let them be sited". When I asked them a question, "Why do you do all these things, puttings pins in your cheecks and into your noses, and painting your hair? What is the need to do this outwar thing? There is no need to do this". So they said, "Can you tell us what's wrong with us?" Now you can't answer, there is no wrong. Because if you want to cut your nose, "What's wrong?". If you want to destroy yourself, "What’s wrong?" Because you think you have created your own body, you think this body is your own domain, that you can do what you like with your body or with your mind, or whatever you think is your own. It is all God’s creation. He has created you for a very special purpose. He has created you to enter into his kingdom, to enjoy the peace and joy and the great citizenship of his domain where He takes you out of the realm of cause and effect. You just go beyond cause and effect.

This is what it is: if somebody calls himself a guru, or he says that, "I am doing this and I am this and this", branded themself as something, let us see if they have gone beyond the effects of cause and effects. Like we always think of a sickness, like Kundalini now will rise and solve that problem. We think of a disease, when we say that, "This is the cause. Because of this, this disease has come". Kundalini is beyond, and she will rise and tell you that, "No, these two things do not exist. The cause does not exist, so the effect does not exist". We have to go to that realm, which is absolutely nourishing, fulfilling, understanding and thinking.

What we think with our mental projection is nothing but a linear projection. We move in a linear direction, like science. Now we are going in one linear direction, ultimately we created the atom bomb, and now we are aghast. What have we created to kill ourselves? Any linear movement, mental movement, goes to the extreme of the right-sided people which are called as ‘rajasikas’, to such an extent that they see the effects of that, and then they get frightened. The way we have developed industrially ourselves also, we have done the same harm to ourselves. Now we don’t know because there is acid rain coming, all the trees are getting lost, the ecological balance is gone.

So, we come to the point that we have lost our balance. Now what is a balance? It’s as he has told you, that on that green portion that you see, is the balanced established. The other day, doctor Warren asked Me a question, "Mother why should we have dharma? Why should we have balance?" I used to say that, "You must have balance to ascend". But more than that, a person who is in balance, what happens that, in that area, the fat of that area has to rise to the brain to fulfil the necessity of the use of cells. These cells, when they rise there, if they have no balance, they go mad. And that's how we have no understanding as to what is right and what is wrong. But if you are a balanced person, as said in the Ten Commandments, the Ten Guru Tattvas, the Guru principles, if you have those intact, then the experience of the cell is endowered with it, and when they go to the brain, then what happens that you do not feel any attraction to these stupid things that we do with our ego.
