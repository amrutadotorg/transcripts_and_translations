I bow to all the seekers of truth. I bow because I see the category of seeking written large on your face. And you have been seeking for ages the truth. And as you have heard doctor Warren, he also went through all kinds of seekings in his life, and he was really frustrated. And he felt there is nothing like truth, nothing would do the same for the sake of truth. Truth is there, but it manifests in its own time, in its own course. It has to be understood that we do not understand truth through our mental projections or through our emotional projections, all other things that we do which we can do as human beings.

As he is describing to you other methods and things like that, we should be honest to ourselves and kind to ourselves, because we are seekers of ages, and this seeking has to be fulfilled. We should not try to plays around with words, with misidentifications. Even some people say, "Mother, we have paid money to this particular person, so we must go ahead with it". This kind of a superficial attitude or a frivolous attitude or a kind of a wrongly adjusted attitude, has to be brought to normal thing. There has to be the truth as there has been many prophets, many incarnations, great personalities who talked of truth. None of them took any money, did not have any Rolls Royces, did not live on the earnings of the people whom they talked to. They were self-respecting, glorious people. They believed that they could talk to people, they could communicate with them.

But you found that it was so difficult. People were so conditioned. Whenever they wanted to talk to someone, they found that they were confronted with people who were so conditioned by some sort of a money-oriented organisations. Like the Jews wanted to crucify Christ. For what? What did He do to them? Did He do any wrong? Nothing. Why? Because they were identified with a wrong type of ideology that they could not accept Christ who has suffered for them. They have to suffer themselves, otherwise they cannot go to God. This is just a misunderstanding about God’s wishes and his ways. Why will He want you to suffer? He is not a cruel God to his own children. So, you must suffer! And you know the Jews suffered.

If you ask for something, you get it. In India, the custom is to fast. They fast and fast. I mean, if you ask them on 8 days, out of the week, they fast at least for five days. And we have fasting going on automatically in our country. You don’t ask for miseries. If you ask for miseries, you’ll get miseries. But if you ask for blessings, God gives you blessings. He’s kind, the kindest of all. He is the source of joy. He is the source of all that is blissful, of peace, and of that greatness and nobility about which we have heard.

Now, to understand yourself, first of all you must know that you are all seekers. And you are seekers of truth. Don’t run after something that is not yet the truth. That is one thing I have to tell you. Shri Krishna described very well, about six thousand years back, the three types of permutations and combinations that are formed in human beings.
The first ones are the ‘tamasikas’, are the people who run after something that is wrong. They stick on to it, emotional people, they fall in love with one woman, they’ll waste all their life falling in love with one woman. This life is so precious. This human life is made out of so many tribulations, such care, such gentle handling. You have no idea as to how you are made from amoeba to this stage. And at this stage, to come and suddenly take your ego into your hands and try to do what you like is absurd.

The second type of people are the ones who are the ‘rajasikas’, those who live with ego-orientation, with the ego prompting. Like they form an organization, "All right, this is my organization. I am great, this is my race, I am a special being, this, that". Self-opinionated and hypocritical. And they don’t know what is right and what is wrong. They are harming themselves unnecessarily and harming others without being aware of it. Like, in London, we have something called 'punk' and they also came to my program. And the Sahaja Yogis were rather worried about them. I said, "Let them be sited". When I asked them a question, "Why do you do all these things, putting pins in your cheeks and into your noses, and painting your hair? What is the need to do this outward thing? There is no need to do this". So they said, "Can you tell us what's wrong with us?" Now you can't answer, there is no wrong. Because if you want to cut your nose, "What's wrong?". If you want to destroy yourself, "What’s wrong?" Because you think you have created your own body, you think this body is your own domain, that you can do what you like with your body or with your mind, or whatever you think is your own. It is all God’s creation. He has created you for a very special purpose. He has created you to enter into his kingdom, to enjoy the peace and joy and the great citizenship of his domain where He takes you out of the realm of cause and effect. You just go beyond cause and effect.

This is what it is: if somebody calls himself a guru, or he says that, "I am doing this and I am this and this", branded themself as something, let us see if they have gone beyond the effects of cause and effects. Like we always think of a sickness, like Kundalini now will rise and solve that problem. We think of a disease, when we say that, "This is the cause. Because of this, this disease has come". Kundalini is beyond, and she will rise and tell you that, "No, these two things do not exist. The cause does not exist, so the effect does not exist". We have to go to that realm, which is absolutely nourishing, fulfilling, understanding and thinking.

What we think with our mental projection is nothing but a linear projection. We move in a linear direction, like science. Now we are going in one linear direction, ultimately we created the atom bomb, and now we are aghast. What have we created to kill ourselves? Any linear movement, mental movement, goes to the extreme of the right-sided people which are called as ‘rajasikas’, to such an extent that they see the effects of that, and then they get frightened. The way we have developed industrially ourselves also, we have done the same harm to ourselves. Now we don’t know because there is acid rain coming, all the trees are getting lost, the ecological balance is gone.

So, we come to the point that we have lost our balance. Now what is a balance? It’s as he has told you, that on that green portion that you see, is the balanced established. The other day, doctor Warren asked Me a question, "Mother why should we have dharma? Why should we have balance?" I used to say that, "You must have balance to ascend". But more than that, a person who is in balance, what happens that, in that area, the fat of that area has to rise to the brain to fulfil the necessity of the use of cells. These cells, when they rise there, if they have no balance, they go mad. And that's how we have no understanding as to what is right and what is wrong. But if you are a balanced person, as said in the Ten Commandments, the Ten Guru Tattvas, the Guru principles, if you have those intact, then the experience of the cell is endowered with it, and when they go to the brain, then what happens that you do not feel any attraction to these stupid things that we do with our ego.

Ego is a thing that makes you absolutely stupid. That's the end of ego. If you find somebody stupid, just give him up because he has been an ego-oriented person. But such a person, indiscriminately, can be extremely violent, and can be very destructive as Hitler was. I have seen many people, group of people, who feel that they are challenged because I somehow indirectly challenge them, because I don't take any money, I believe that it should be actualization, it should be actual happening. They try even to come and hit Me and do all kinds of violence. I am surprised how do they call themselves enlightened people. They are supposed to be enlightened, so full of anger and temper. It cannot be an enlightened mind.
So to face it up squarely, to understand it honestly we have to know that it is something that is going to happen to us beyond human behaviour, beyond human expectation, beyond human awareness.

Now what is it that we cannot do? Let us see ,very simple things. We can do for example if there is a tree is dead; we can make a nice staircase or a platform or something from dead to the dead. But we cannot make a flower which is real. We cannot transform a flower into a fruit. We cannot do any living work within ourselves. We can jump, we can scream, we can take some name. For that you don't need a guru. Why do you pay such a lot of money? You are so naive about it. That's what I say that the Indians are quite clever and there, these gurus could not prosper, so they went away to other countries to do all this nonsense. This is not to be taken as something that is going to give you anything. It’s just a marketing stuff. It's a marketing stuff which they have now mastered so well. They know how to advertise, how to talk. It's all so done so well! And you just fix into it so much and it pampers your ego to believe that that is so. But why do you cheat yourself? You have to be honest.

Now the thing is that God has made you in a special way, which of course He has tried to explain. It's such a short time I am with you, but He has tried to explain that you are built up like this. It is said in the Bible that, "I will appear before you like tongues of flames". And these chakras are really like beautiful flames of different colours. But at the Sahasrara in the brain they are thousand and they are of different beautiful cooling colours, flames that are living. You can see them later on, not now, because first the question is of ascent. And when you ascend, then you don't see the light, you become the light. There is a difference between the two. You have to become and becoming is much more important than all this talk, all this saying. You have to become and when you become how do you know that you become is that it happens on your central nervous system, that you feel it on your central nervous system.

For example, if you take a dog and a dog is asked to pass through a dirty lane, the dog will do it, he has no problem. But we cannot pass because we have evolved higher, we have evolved to such an extent that we understand this is dirt field, we can feel it on our central nervous system. So the experiencer of that field and dirt is within us. But when you become a Realized soul you develop a system by which you become the experiencer of virtue, experiencer of goodness, of peace, experiencer of collective consciousness. ‘Collective consciousness’ means you can feel another person, fell chakras on your fingertips. You can feel your chakras which you can cure. This is known as boddha, that means on the central nervous system. This is what is the Vedas. The first verse of Vedas, it is written that whatever is not ‘vidya’ -vidya means, doesn't mean in Sanskrit language, doesn't mean that vidya is something that is your mental projection. But vidya means what happens to your awareness, a new dimension must come on your awareness then it is vidya, otherwise it is not vidya. It's just thinking that, "I am great, I am belonging to this organization, I am doing this". You are just trying to put yourself down. Please listen that it has to come on your central nervous system. The central nervous system itself should have the experience of the Spirit, and it should be able to record not only that but decode everything.

So the first stage of the yoga is there, where you become one with the Divine. This is pure simple Patanjali Yoga I am telling you. Those people who believe in standing on your heads, and doing all these things, it’s just a wee bit of it. Actually, it is nothing compared to the whole book of Patanjali which nobody reads. It has come in through so many Western ideas, you see, trickling down into something which I don't know from where. Poor Patanjali must be turning in his grave, thinking what's happening to these people. Now if you read Patanjali he is clear cut. He said that, "When you get your Realization, you first get into the state of thoughtless awareness, which is called as nirvichara samadhi. And then the second state is the state of nirvikalpa, where you become doubtlessly aware". That doesn't mean that mentally, but actually on your fingers, you become clear cut. Your sensitivity becomes clear cut. That's the doubtless awareness state of your being, which is to be established in Sahaja Yoga. You cannot just talk or do something or something outside that it is going to work out. It is something that works out inside.

But when there is the light inside, it is projected out to the other people. Because it is collectively conscious, it knows where it is required, how it has to flow. If you know now the expertise of handling, not the experience, but the experience and then the expertise of handling this All-pervading Power of God, which does all these living things, then you become a Yogi. Then you are a Yogi. Not just somebody gives you a name, "Now you are this yogi, that yogi, this Ananda, that Vananda. Then, by these names and all that, don't be satisfied, don't cheat yourself. You must understand something has to happen within yourself.

If you read any of our traditional treaties in India, because India has dealt with the roots, while the West has dealt with the trees. You have developed lot of it on the other side, and we have not yet been able to put forward, what we had developed. And we are developing on the other side which is the roots. If the roots are not there, the tree will topple down. And this has to come to you in a clear-cut way to understand that what we have traditionally having, one after another, based on evolutionary process, comes to this point. Now is described already that, "In these modern times, thousands of people are going to get their Realization". It is described by a great, we should say, the originator or the person who really started the whole of astrology. His name was Bhrigu. And Bhrigu wrote one book called ‘Bhrigu Samhita’, and another is Nadi Granth. In the ‘Nadi Granth’ he described exactly what is going to happen in Kali Yuga. Not only that, but he has also been interpreted by another scholar, Bhagandar, in Karnataka, who has written a book in Sanskrit, that what he is saying is, "These times, he has described, when thousands will get Realization".

Not only that, but even William Blake who recently about hundred years back he died in England. He has described into such details as to what is Sahaja Yoga is. He said, "The men of God will become prophets". ‘Will become’ again he used the word ‘become’ clearly. "And they will have powers to make other prophets". He has described even the ashrams we are going to have, even my house, the location of it, absolutely. So just see the amount of seeing he had, the seer. The seer of such a great quality was born in England, and he said that, "Jerusalem has to be established in England". Very difficult though, but still. Because according to us, England is the heart of the universe. Anything that happens in England or goes to England circulates. But as you know that English are very difficult people, are very hard nuts and I had to work with only seven people for four years. Imagine Christ was allowed to speak only for four years. And I was busy with seven people, struggling with them in England, for four continuous years. I was so fed up! If I had spent those four years in India, thousands would have got Realization. They do, I just work for about two months to India and thousands get Realization. They are just waiting Me to be there.

But I think you are all very deserving people. You are the people who are great saints born again in those countries who have so much of seeking. Imagine, in Australia about, say even thirty years back, so many people talking about these things! They were like a horse with a blinker. They could not see anything here and there. But these new people, of new category, have been born in all these countries and it is my duty to see that they are all given their Realization.
The interviewer asked Me, "Why do you do this work?" Now how can you explain? Why did Christ do anything? Or why did Mohammed? Must you have some sort of an intention behind everything? It can be just my pleasure or maybe my nature that I have to do it. It's like this that if you, when you get these spiritual powers within you, you really become a real capitalist in the sense that you have the capital. And then you become like a communist because you cannot live without giving it. You want to do it. Christ has said, "The enlightened light - or the lamp- is not kept under the table". In the same way, you start giving it to others in full way, working hard for it, and you never feel you are working hard. You are so relaxed and so peaceful, so happy about it.

Now I have to request you that as today is the only first day I have visited Brisbane, and that this is absolutely a new subject to you. Maybe some might have talked about Kundalini in a very vague way, or in a way that could have frightened you. I have to tell you that, though I have come here after twelve years of my work, I find Brisbane has very good vibrations and you all can get your Realization, if you want to get it. I cannot cross your freedom. If you are not wanting, I cannot do it. Because the center path is for the people who have their full freedom to choose the right thing.

We have two types, as I told you, the one who go after wrong things, the other who do not know what is right and wrong and try to have something always new from somewhere which has no basis, which has no tradition, nothing. And the central one are the people who know what is the right thing, and try to go to the right thing. These are the people are called as the ‘sattvikas’. This is the special category of people. You can only give this Realization to people who are ‘sattvikas’, who are the people who are seeking for the right, who have discarded all that is wrong. Like as you have seen Dr. Warren, and there are many others who have gone through all kinds of various things. I mean, to hear from them, I am amazed how many things they have been through. When one gentleman came to see Me he started telling Me he has been here, he has been there, I said, "You’d better write it down". He wrote six pages altogether, you see, full scape on both the sides, how many places poor man has been and he was in a very big mess, health wise, mentally everywhere. So I told him, "Now you burn all this off and come back clean, now let's have it done again". He got his Realization, despite all these things he had done. I must say he got his Realization and he is a very good Sahaja Yogi today.
