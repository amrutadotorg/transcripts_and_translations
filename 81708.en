I bow to all the seekers of truth. I bow because I see the category of seeking writ large on your face. And you have been seeking for ages the truth. And as doctor Warren, he also went through all kinds of seekings in his life, and he was really frustrated. And he felt there is nothing like truth, nothing would do the same for the sake of truth. Truth is there, but it manifests in its own time, in its own course. It has to be understood that we do not understand truth through our mental projections or through our emotional projections, all other things that we do which we can do as human beings.

As he is describing to you other methods and things like that, we should be honest to ourselves and kind to ourselves, because we are seekers of ages and this seeking has to be fulfilled. We should not try to plays around with words, with misidentifications. Even some people say, "Mother, we have paid money to this particular person, so we must go ahead with it". This kind of a superficial attitude or a frivolous attitude or a kind of a wrongly adjusted attitude, has to be brought to normal thing. There has to be the truth as there has been many prophets, many incarnations, great personalities who talked of truth. None of them took any money, did not have any Rolls Royces, did not live on the earnings of the people whom they talked to. They were self-respecting, glorious people. They believed that they could talk to people. They could communicate with them.

But you found that it was so difficult. People were so conditioned. Whenever they wanted to talk to someone, they found that they were confronted with people who were so conditioned by some sort of a money-oriented organisations. Like the Jews wanted to crucify Christ for what? What did he do to them? Did he do any wrong? Nothing. Why? Because they were identified with the wrong type of an ideology, that they cannot accept Christ who had suffered from them, they have to suffer themselves, otherwise they cannot go to God. This is just a misunderstanding of God’s wishes and his ways. Why will he want you to suffer? He is not a cruel God to his own children. So, you must suffer! And you know the Jews suffered.

If you ask for something, you get it. In India, the custom is to fast. They fast and fast. I mean, if you ask them on 8 days, out of the week, they fast at least for five days. And we have fasting goi g on automatically in our country. You don’t ask for miseries. If you ask for miseries, you’ll get miseries. But if you ask for blessings, God gives you blessings.
