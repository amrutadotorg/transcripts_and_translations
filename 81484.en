Well, we were living in the ashram in Regent's Park Road. It's a long story. Gregor had finished The Advent. He was going down to see Shri Mataji every day while she was making corrections, and it needed to be typed. I was doing temporary typing, so I stopped my work for what we thought would be a week. He hired a typewriter, and I was going to type it.

There were no word processors. She had to retype every page, every time. Every single day, it would be a rewrite. Gregor would go down to see Shri Mataji, argue every point, and at the end of the day—this is his own explanation—he'd end up on Mother's feet saying, "No, you're right, Mother." Then we'd have to retype it. I did some very strange typos. He came to me once and said that he didn't think that Pluto was that philosophical, instead of Plato.

Anyway, I had applied to go to teacher training college because I thought I should do something; I was just doing typing at the time. I was also looking at various other things. Handling typing for The Advent was a bit of a juggling job because Gregor was finding it all very tough. Rustem was there, and he was watching this play going on between us. He said, "I think actually you could do psychology." I said, "Really? Me?" I didn't think I was that sort of intelligent, if you like, but I applied to do a psychology course on the basis of that.

Well, I didn't get offered an interview for the teacher training, but I did get offered an interview for the psychology degree—a science degree. This was completely out of my whatever, as I had gone to art college. So I went for the interview, and it was a whole day of tests and interviews. I really thought my head was just on fire by the end of it.

We used to go and see Shri Mataji a lot, and I went back to her flat at Ashley Gardens. When I walked in the room, she said, "Agnya one, what's the matter?" I thought, "This is the end of my psychology." So I said, "I've just been for an interview for psychology." She said, "Oh, that doesn't matter. Come here, it's alright." And she just put me—put your hand here, and one hand out the window—we'll sort it out.

So I went to East London to do a psychology degree. On the first day, I realized I had been living in a cocoon of Sahaja Yoga, living in the ashram with my brothers and sisters. Work was just something I did to earn money, and suddenly I was thrown into a university course with all these young people. Mother had gotten us to change our dress to try and get rid of the bhoots, so I'd given up my jeans and was wearing Laura Ashley and that kind of thing. No make-up, no high heels—everything was very sort of played down. And I was in among all these bright young things. I was so shy, and it was such a new experience for me. I sat in the first chair I possibly could at the front.

It turns out I'd sat in somebody's friend's seat that they'd been keeping for them. This boy was called Mark, and I got to know him through this. There was a girl that I also got to know, and she liked him very much, so I tried to play whatever. I said, "This boy likes you," and he said, "Well, I actually like you." I said, "Oh my God. I'm a Sahaja Yogi. You see, I do this thing, and I'm here to save the world." Yes, you're talking about us. "The only thing I can do is get married. I can't have a boyfriend." So he said, "Well, that's not out of the question."

So I phoned Shri Mataji up, and I said, "Mother, I've met this boy, and he wants to marry me." I was trying to say he felt vibrations, and she said, "What does his father do? What is his job? What's he studying? What are his prospects?" I was so stunned. I thought it was more interesting that he felt vibrations, but no. She said, "Alright, bring him along."

I took him to Caxton Hall, and Pat knew nothing about this because I was going to my university. Mother was coming, seeing everybody through the seats in the hall, and when she got to him, I sidled up and said, "This is the one." I sidled away again. She got Gavin to check him, and then when she was leaving, we all stood on the pavement of Caxton Hall for hours, saying goodbye to Mother and goodbye to each other. Mother was getting into her car, and I leant forward and said, "Well?" and she said, "May God bless you. It's fine."

So I turned around to Pat and said, "Pat, this is Mark. I'm going to marry him." And he said, "Don't you ever do anything like that again! What do you think you're doing?"

About a year later, Mother asked Mark where he first felt vibrations, and he said it was from a photograph that a friend had brought back from the meetings I had started, because that was the first time I'd started a meeting. And she said, "Oh, you're born-realized." So he had quite a tough time of it because he had married a total fanatic whose Sahaja Yoga was first, foremost, and forever. But she must have arranged our marriage.

Similar to Douglas, we had a registry office marriage organized with our family, and that was on the 18th of July. Our Sahaja Yoga marriage was going to be the next day. We had booked a honeymoon in the Lakes, a week in a cottage. But the Sahaja wedding kept being moved until it was the 24th of July. So from the 18th to the 24th, we had to cancel this week in the Lakes.

When we got married, the Sahaja Yogis—like Pat said he sold that stereo to make some money—they gathered money together and bought us a ticket to go to Paris. We stayed in Marie's flat that Mother had just been staying in. We stayed in this vibrated flat for our honeymoon for 10 days in Paris.

But the wedding was at Hester's place in Hampstead. No, it was actually in Hampstead in the Temple of All Faiths. The reception was at Hester's place; she did a wonderful, very, very beautiful thing for us. But at the wedding in Hampstead, Shri Mataji had bought the wedding jewelry for me. She had given me the wedding sari. And she brought...
