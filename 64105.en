Gregoire:

So, good evening, and could you please take your seat. I am told that Shri Mataji is watching this program on a video link.

So, let's try to move from the trivial to the sublime, because that's the word that Philippe has been using. And this is actually the challenge that we sometimes face. We move in the trivial; our life is made of it. And then we go to a place like Cabella, and we endeavor to face an awesome reality. A reality whose magnitude is so far beyond us that it needs our fullest attention, our fullest focus, to be able to approach it.

There is reality, and there is its contrary. You can call it virtual reality, you can call it thinking or emotions. The reality is beyond that. And all this is just to introduce the immense privilege that we have to celebrate a Shri Shiva Puja, a Sakshat Shri Shiva Puja, where we should take the maximum opportunity and the maximum benefit for ourselves. This is an opportunity not to be egoistic, but to be spiritually self-centered.

In our pilgrimage, we have knocked at the gate of the Goddess as bhaktas—or more likely as beggars, and then becoming bhaktas. And so tonight, the organizing countries would like to welcome the bhaktas of the Goddess and the bhaktas of Lord Shiva. It's a privilege. We are not that many, which will bring us the feeling of community that we used to have in earlier days when we all knew each other, which is no longer the case because our group has grown and our community has become worldwide.

So, in that pilgrimage, we are often confused, and it is good to remind ourselves of what is the destination. It is interesting that in the old sayings of India, in the old mythologies, it is Shri Brahma Deva who advised the Devas to go either to Vaikuntha, or to the Goddess, or to Kailash to solve the issues that the Devas cannot solve by themselves. Shri Brahma Deva is the magnificent and the plenitude of Godhead. It means his advice is really to go to the feet of Mount Kailash.

In the same way, we need to resolve tonight. This puja can be anything. We can come, we can go, we can maybe touch some moment of thoughtless awareness and forget it. But we can, like the Devas of old, in utter almost desperation but in utter focus of desire, address ourselves at the lotus feet of Shri Mataji. Because when we take the mantra of Shri Nirmala Atma, it is that the cosmic location of Shri Shiva today is in the Atma of Shri Mataji. We don't understand what all this means, of course. We don't understand much, or anything at all.

But Lord Shiva is the destination. Lord Vishnu helps us to evolve, helps us to become, with the Mahalakshmi power. Because you cannot go to a king in tatters; you cannot go to a king in maculated clothes. And so, the Goddess prepares us to eventually be able to appear before the Father.

If a little child is saying, "I'm the Emperor Ashoka, I'm the Emperor Ashoka," it may be cute, but you don't become the Emperor Ashoka that easily. In the same way, when we say, "Shivoham, Shivoham," it may be cute, but this "ham" doesn't come so easily.

Why did we come to Sahaja Yoga in the first place? Maybe we came for this, or maybe we came for that: for healing, for friends, for friendship, for community. Maybe then we discovered the magnetism and the love of our Divine Mother. And maybe, finally, we understand it. We come to Sahaja Yoga because there are two relationships in Sahaja Yoga: one is with the self, and one is with God. People may say the most important relationship is with Shri Mataji, but when I say one is with the self and one is with God, I mean fully that Shri Mataji is in those relationships.

The Shri Shiva Puja is an opportunity to pray to our Divine Mother because she's the only one who brings us to the Father. There is no way we have a chance to access the beginning of the hilltops of Kailash without her blessing, without the Kundalini cleansing us, cleansing our clothes, cleansing our koshas. So, if we are here with a deeper understanding of what we can achieve at this Puja, and if we pray, "Mother, please, despite my shortcomings, Mother please, despite my feelings, accept, Mother, that in all sincerity, I pray you bring me where you would wish me to be. That I can become what I came to Sahaja to become."

If we become the self, we become part of God, because the Atma is part of Paramatma. It's nothing less, nothing more. Sahaja Yoga is about God, and the names that we use for that don't matter. This is Allah, as Shri Mataji says. There is only one God; this is Lord Shiva. And Allahu Akbar—this Akbar is Shri Krishna who manifests it all. So, we are faced by this awesome reality in our small little brains. It takes a little effort. It takes chitta shakti; it takes the power of a purified attention. And without a good right side, there is no way we can go to a good left side, and vice versa. Attention. Without attention, we cannot say anything.

So tonight, this weekend, we have come here to worship Shri Mataji in the form of Lord Shiva. And in worshipping that, we worship our destination. We worship what we want to become. We worship what she is wishing to give us. And with that understanding, we possibly pray that this be, spiritually, a milestone on our path, because we still have to move. We still have to go farther inside.

If we go inside, then we will find each other. It is by going inside that we will find our true unity. Because if I become my Atma, if anyone around me becomes Atma, then our oneness will be of the purest kind. We cannot achieve oneness by willing it and by exchanging arguments. We can only achieve it by becoming the same, if it is to be genuine and spiritual. This is why so many of us became Sahajis. And this is why tonight we are all so privileged to offer our devotion and a lot of faith to this truly awesome incarnation of Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi that we so little understand.

So, with these words, I wanted to invite you to desire to rise to what can be our full potential, because we sometimes linger in mediocrity and we waste our time on smaller things.

And with this invitation, I would like to leave you for a very short program, I understand. The next one is going to be the children of Chen Presi, and then I think we will have some bhajan. Then I'll come back for one or two poems or things. But feel what we need for this.

Jai Shri Mataji.
Jai Shri Mataji.
