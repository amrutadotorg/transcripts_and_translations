Jai Shri Mataji, Jeremy. Jai Shri Mataji, Felicity. Thank you both for joining us this morning for a special session on your lovely times with Shri Mataji. And thank you, Felicity, for coordinating, because Jeremy is in Turkey, which is two hours ahead of us, while you are in Devon and we are here in Kent.

So, Jeremy, you've been in our session before, and we'll provide the link of how Sahaja Yoga started in the southeast in Brighton, where you discussed with Kay and with Kingsley some very nice experiences of yourselves with Pamela and other yogis of that time. Could you please remind us briefly how you got your realization and what it was like meeting Shri Mataji for the first time?

Well, to cut it short, I was looking for a house and somewhere to live in Brighton. I answered an ad and it must have been Pamela's house. She said, "Come along," and she took me down to her living room, which was actually downstairs. It was a little semi-detached house, or terrace house rather, in Brighton, and she gave me realization there. Then she said, "Oh, well, now you must come and live in my house." So that's how it all started. Apparently, Shri Mataji had had a puja in that house just a few days or weeks before, so it was a very vibrated little house. And there was just me, her son, and there was another lodger as well, but he wasn't a Sahaja Yogi.

This was in 1980. Yes, September 1980.

And when did you meet Shri Mataji first? And what was that like? Because you weren't exactly seeking; you chanced upon it?

No, I was seeking in my own way. It's just that I didn't think I was a seeker because the people that I went to university with were very intellectual. They were into drugs and weird music and weird stuff, the intellectual stuff that didn't really resonate with me. I wasn't interested in all this intellectual stuff, although I felt that if you could understand the mind, you could understand who we were and what we were doing here. And I studied psychology at university as part of my course. So I was very interested in that side of things, but not the kind of heavy philosophy stuff which other seekers, or so-called seekers, were interested in.

So you got your realization at Pam's place, bless her. How long was it before you met Shri Mataji? And what was that like for you?

All I remember was being in a public program. I think it was in Hampstead. It wasn't Caxton Hall because it was much more intimate. I was sitting in about the middle of the room, and I just felt that Shri Mataji was looking in my direction, looking either through me or at someone behind me. I kept on looking around, and there was no one behind me. She was looking through me and really focusing her attention. I don't remember the details of what Shri Mataji said, of course, but I just remember feeling this amazing experience of her attention on me. Yeah, that's pretty much everything.

She would pick out the seekers in the crowd, and they wouldn't necessarily be who we thought they would be. She would give special attention. I'm not surprised if she was looking straight at you, because she knows who the seeker is. She knew. And I learned to watch who Shri Mataji was paying attention to and talking to.

So, Jeremy, having Shri Mataji's attention on you is such a phenomenal thing. From our own limited understanding and intellect, how did you experience the bliss or miracles? Is there anything that you would like to share with us?

Well, Shri Mataji didn't really pay much attention to me in England, as it happens. I was just one of the crowd. The only time I do remember... one time at Caxton Hall, I was quite near the front. When she was giving the realization, it was very powerful. Then in the meditation afterwards, I just felt there was a flood of vibrations rolling off the stage. You know that dry ice vapor? It just rolls along the floor. It was just like it rolled off the stage and just covered us, this sort of almost freezing fog of vibrations. You couldn't actually see it, but it just filled the room. I remember that being one of the most remarkable experiences at the beginning.

We used to go up to Caxton Hall on the train very often. It was our kind of Monday ritual. We were living in Brighton, but every Monday evening, I think, there was Caxton Hall in the early 80s, and we used to all go up on the train together.

But miracles were another thing. They wouldn't be something earth-shattering; they would be something that you would say was an incredible coincidence. Like, you would meet someone in some place or have a chance meeting, but you knew after a while there was no coincidence in Sahaja Yoga.

One thing I suppose was a kind of a miracle to me. I was living at home with my parents, and I know Shri Mataji had asked us to help get this house ready, I think it was in Surbiton. I was speaking to John Watkinson, and he needed help, so I went up there. I wanted to borrow my father's car, but when I asked him where it was, it wasn't where he said it was. It should have been just in front of the house, but it wasn't. So I went up on the train, and it was really strange. It seemed like someone had stolen the car.

We were working all night in this tiny little bathroom, tiling, and I just remember thinking that if Shri Mataji asked me if I wanted a boon, I would ask for my father's car to be returned. Then I thought that's a kind of strange thing to ask for; there are other things I could ask for. Anyway, when I went home—we saw Shri Mataji arrive—I went home, and that night a piece of paper had appeared on the doorstep of my father's house. It was a sort of cut-out, with letters from a newspaper, a sheet of paper with letters cut out saying where the car was. My father went there, and it was there.

So someone had stolen it but then decided to return it or let you know where it was?

Yes, but who would go to all the trouble to cut out the letters? I thought it must be my sister who had gone off and had a joyride in the car, but she denied it. So it was a mystery how that appeared on the doorstep. You could say, okay, it was just a coincidence, but a very strange coincidence.

And you got your boon.

Well, yes, in a way it was. Shri Mataji often said you have to be careful what you ask for, because you'll get it.

No, it's very true. So, Felicity, were you and Jeremy together in England at that point in those early years, in the early 80s?

Well, I came in '79, and there weren't very many people, only like 30 or 40 in April of '79. Then that year, just a lot of people started coming. All the Brighton people came, the TM people came, John Watkinson... so many of the original yogis who are still with us came in that year.

But I remember Jeremy coming. The first time I met Jeremy was when we were in Chelsea Road. I don't think you remember this, Jeremy, but I was upstairs in the meditation room at the time, and you were brought in as a new person. You must have come up with the Brighton people. When I saw you, I felt, "Oh, I must get to know him," because you came in with just such a lovely, normal, balanced, warm-hearted vibration. Jeremy stood out because he wasn't like many people who had come into Sahaja Yoga at that point. He just kind of floated along with everything that was going on.

Then I would go up and down to Brighton quite a lot because Brighton was a very warm-hearted collective. You'd think this is the example of how a collective should be. They were very sweet and supportive of each other. London was a big challenge. You just can't understand what it was like to live in London in those days. Shri Mataji gave this talk where she says, "Just look at everything three feet below—the grass, the children, and the sky," because we were so weak in our chakras that you just sucked up everything from people around you. So after Caxton Hall meetings, you just tried to keep the vibrations in and protect yourself.

I'm telling this as a sort of background story about the depth of connection of the yogis who came in at that time. Shri Mataji said a lot of us had been with her before. She would say to us, "You've all been with me before. You were with me in Jesus's time," which was very powerful to be told that when you're not feeling like a great soul particularly. To be told that you have this bond, this connection with Shri Mataji... and literally, that's what you felt like. She was calling people to come. Sometimes she'd say, "Oh, you're here now," as some new person who now is established.

This purity, you know, Shri Mataji talks about the purity of the brother-sister relationship, which I felt. You just know they have your back, that they're there for you. It was very fleeting, but it was so powerful. And I went, "Oh, oh, I think so." She was saying to us that we experienced that state.

We came together and we were there together. And other people would say, if you ask other older yogis, they'll say, "Yes, yes, I felt I recognized so-and-so." I've experienced it later on, even as recently as 10 years ago, when you meet someone and you just feel this connection. Like, "Oh, they're so nice, I just want to be with them." And later you kind of meditate on it a bit, and it feels like this complete comfortableness of being.

Thanks, Felicity. I'm only aware of this engineer visiting, and therefore the connectivity, so it might seem a bit abrupt. I'm sorry to interrupt, but what I wanted to ask was about the purity of the relationship and chastity. We're going back a few decades here, and you guys were all very young, as people are today, the Yuvas, and will be in the future. I'm sure there would have been instances where people would come in and forget the boundaries, that they're not to flirt or have unwanted relationships. How did you remind yourself, Jeremy, and how did you deal with it, both of you?

Well, that's a very good question, but it opens up a very intimate chapter.

I'm sorry.

No, it's a very important thing. I kind of promised myself I would write a book. Actually, I promised Shri Mataji in a way. She once asked me to write a book. I don't know if I told you. She asked me to write a book on the heart, probably because of my heart and because England represents the heart and all this sort of stuff.

About that, when did she say that to you?

She was... you know how she asked people to do things? She asked people to make films, asked people to write books. There was one person, I won't mention his name, but he was supposed to have written this book, and he was still working on it after years and years. She was giving him a bit of a left-right, and then she said, "Jeremy, why don't you write a book?" And I felt, "Oh my God, she just wants to blast me too." So I haven't actually written it yet.

There are these maryadas, but we in the West don't have boundaries, and that is a huge handicap when you are talking about having a pure collective. You don't know where one relationship ends and another one begins, especially when you're young. You feel all these emotions, especially when you're going through puberty or adolescence, and you have this rush of emotions and God knows what else. You don't know how to handle it. If you don't have some sort of guidelines or some understanding of what it is and how you're supposed to behave, it's very easy to go off track. Extremely easy.

I'll just give you one example of where Shri Mataji really saved me. There was a relationship which I had with a sister in Brighton, and we were very, very close. As I felt a close bond with Felicity, as she says, which was very pure, with this other girl it was pretty pure too. But we had this connection that was so strong. I could totally understand what she was thinking. I would be in a certain place, and then she would also be in that place. It would be uncanny. And it was kind of deeper.

Then she wanted to get married. So at the end of one tour in India, I asked Shri Mataji if it would be right if we got married. She said, "Ah, who is it? And when was she born?" I said she was born on the 6th of June. She says, "Oh, 6th of June. It's not good." She then said that anyone born in the first two weeks of June, it's a very dodgy period. I don't know if she knew, but of course she did know: almost all my family is born in the first two weeks of June. It's really strange. My son, my brothers, my father, my sister, generations, even my grandmother.

So she said, "Better wait." Okay, "better wait." That's all she said. And so when I went back, I just said, "I spoke to Shri Mataji, but she said better wait." But it didn't go down very well with the other person, and then she kind of went out of Sahaja Yoga pretty quickly.

Very good advice. You see, if you're open with Shri Mataji... I didn't want to make it my decision. In the early days, you really had to go on what Shri Mataji said. You couldn't be in Sahaja Yoga and take too many big decisions for yourself.

There were other people who asked Shri Mataji to marry someone, and she said, "If it makes you happy." And then when it didn't work out, the person said, "Well, Shri Mataji, you said okay." She said, "No, I didn't say okay. I said, 'if it makes you happy.'" She said the marriage should give you joy, and that's an important point.

What you've just mentioned... I had a similar situation where someone was saying to me, "I don't know if I should marry you or the other person," this other girl, and I was really shocked. I was able to ask Shri Mataji in the car. I thought, "I can't deal with this. I can't make a decision." I wanted to give it to Mother. So I said in the car to her, "Oh, Shri Mataji, so-and-so said this." She was very quiet for a while and then she just said, "Oh, you should marry someone who you can talk to." And that was the end of it. But as you said, because you were detached, you were completely surrendering it to Mother, she gives you an honest answer. And in your case, she did it in a very sweet way.

We will share that link, because it was in Brighton that Shri Mataji gave the talk on the importance of chastity and the purity of the brother-sister relationship, and keeping the importance to Shri Ganesha—all those reminders that we need on a practically everyday basis, more so the younger people who are still finding their feet and looking to have a family at some point in Sahaja Yoga.

What Jeremy said raises a very important point for young people. Jeremy had a lovely warm heart. He was very likable and very innocent and pure. And this is how our Yuvas are. It attracts non-Sahaj young people. The vibrations attract them to Yuvas because they don't meet people like this in their ordinary life. The Sahaja Yogi young people stand out because they have this purity and this innocence. And so as a young person, this is what I said to my kids...

I'm so sorry, I will have to wrap it up very quickly because the engineer is going to cut the line. So Felicity, if you could please conclude what you were saying quickly.

I was just saying you should decide for yourself what kind of marriage you want. Do you want a Sahaj marriage or a non-Sahaj marriage? You have that choice, and you have to be aware that other young people are going to be attracted to you, but you can decide whether you want to keep that relationship pure with that person or not. You can say to them, "I just want to be as a brother to you or as a sister to you."

It's cut. You've gone. Oh dear, what a shame. And I'm still recording, I think, but... she's gone, hasn't she?

She's gone, has she? Oh, what a shame. So there's three... she's still supposedly there. I don't know. That was not what I was expecting at all.

Are we still being recorded?

No, no, it says "request host to start cloud recording," so it's stopped. The recording stopped.

Now it's stopped. Yes. Okay. Oh, well. Next time we should have a time when there isn't a kind of... I mean, we only had like half an hour or less. I said to her, "Why don't we do it?" I had no idea why she wanted to schedule it then, because she even had another Zoom to arrange a different meeting earlier. We could have talked earlier. It was very... Okay.

*

Oh, hello, Jeremy. We're back online. Thank you so much, Jeremy and Felicity, for rejoining us after a little bit of a break because of signals. Hopefully, this will carry on smoothly. Could you please continue what you were sharing on the importance of the purity of the brother-sister relationship, Felicity?

Right. So just to recap a little bit, you'd asked the question, how did we manage? Because we had many ashrams, and we were all young people. Mostly, there were very few people who were over 25, 26, 27. From my experience, we just wanted to be Sahaja Yogis. You just wanted to be with Mother, and it was very clear. We were like a family. She was the mother; we were the children.

But I mean, temptations came in, as you say. This is the way the negativity wants to break the collectivity and disturb the vibrations. And over time, I learned to recognize it. I described my relationship with Jeremy before, this purity of the brother-sister relationship. I think I was very lucky because I had a blood brother in my own family. I understood there was something inside me that recognized innocence and purity and chastity. But sometimes I had one experience where I saw somebody and you get this... it's actually like something that comes in from outside of you, and you suddenly feel these kind of attractive feelings towards this person.

This is when you have to use your common sense. As a yogi, we have our emotions and we have our intellect. As a yogi, we are in the middle; we are integrated. You have to balance your emotions with your intellect and go beyond to the world of the spirit. Sometimes you have to use your common sense and just go, "Why do I want to get into that kind of relationship?" For me, it was very clear, but I think for young people growing up in Sahaja Yoga too, they have hopefully been mostly protected. I see a very deep innocence and almost naivety in a nice way. They're very trusting. They feel everybody is like them. Their personalities, their vibrations are very attractive to other people, mostly outside Sahaja Yoga. But as a yogi, as a person, you do have a choice. Mother gives us freedom of choice.

We can decide where we put our affections, where we put our love. People can be very flattering, and as young people and even older people, we can be "love-bombed," as they talk about nowadays. You can be overwhelmed with these feelings of being loved and understood. But you have to try to go deep in yourself and be clear in yourself: "What do I want? Am I here to evolve, to grow, to become the spirit? Or will I be happy and satisfied with a different kind of relationship or marriage?"

Shri Mataji, in those early years... she was kind of learning about human beings, how complicated they can be. I can remember asking her a question about something, "Why does my heart feel like this?" And she looked at me, and it was kind of like, "I don't know. Why does it feel like that?" I just heard her recently on a talk saying, "I can't tell you what to do. I can't fix things for you. You have to work it out. You have to be your own guru."

In the same way, you have to develop your understanding of the maryadas. When you're on a spiritual path and you want to be a spiritual being, when you stick to the maryadas, you feel good. It gives you strength and a security. When you go off a little bit, things start to get confusing. I have to say, from my own experience before Sahaja Yoga, Shri Ganesha will show you if you're going over the maryadas. If you're talking with someone from the opposite sex and you're becoming a little bit more involved or sharing a bit too much, you're losing that boundary of yourself. He will give you a warning signal. You will feel it. But whether you listen to that or ignore it is up to you. And if you ignore it, he will just stop. He won't keep on pressing the warning buttons. So really, as you're growing older and learning to understand relationships, you have to know yourself. Ask, "Is this good for my spirit? Is this what I want? Who am I?" Mother said, "Know yourself." It is a growing path.

In her compassion, as Jeremy said, in those early years some people did match themselves, and Shri Mataji allowed it, but not many of them survived. In a Sahaj match, Mother has said so clearly, she's matching you vibrationally for your spiritual ascent. Anyway, that's another topic altogether. Thanks for listening.

I just wanted to share a little bit about the brother-sister relationship and how precious that is and how it gives you such a different depth of security.

Sorry to interrupt, but your voice is coming over a little bit distorted. I don't know if the phone is on a table and it's vibrating. Can you put it on a cloth or something so it's not distorting? I didn't want to interrupt because that was such an important thing you were saying.

Thanks for pointing it out. Is that better?

Not much.

No? It's quite clear to me here.

Okay, all right. If it's clear to you, that's fine, because you're doing the recording.

I will leave all these bits in there for people to enjoy our conversations as we are grappling with technology in Turkey and England. Tell us, Jeremy, as a young man then, how did you deal with it? Because even now there are more yoginis, more young girls, than there are young men. And what did you find reassuring? Because I know young people now in universities or colleges where they're just surrounded by non-yogis and it's so in your face.

Well, as a man, I found it easier. There's a nice saying in English where the man chases the girl until the girl catches him. So it's actually the girl that decides in the end. If you don't chase girls, at least in the past, there was a kind of thing that the girls wouldn't be so shameless as to say what they felt or to openly say that they were interested in you. So I was blissfully unaware of anything that was going on.

Because as Felicity said, it's a question of priorities. What is your priority? What are you looking for? And basically, yes, I was looking for evolution, to become the spirit, to know myself. So my attention was very much on myself, improving myself and becoming the spirit.

And there's a very nice story connected with that. We were also very, very lucky because we had Shri Mataji with us. I think this was the most important difference between Sahaja Yoga then and Sahaja Yoga now. Because we had Shri Mataji with us, she would be like a mother to us, literally telling us every little detail, from how to brush your teeth to how to meditate. It was a small group, so she knew everyone intimately. She knew us all personally. She knew about our families, she knew everything about you, even things that you didn't really know about yourself. I remember one time I introduced someone to Shri Mataji, and she said, "Yes, I know them." It's like she knew who you were even before you came to Sahaja Yoga.

So it was a case that if your priority was inside, if your priority was the spirit, your priority was evolution, you could remain in Sahaja Yoga. But if it wasn't, then you couldn't even stay in Sahaja Yoga. It just wasn't possible. Whereas now there are so many people on the periphery or who can get distracted. But at the beginning, Shri Mataji was building the foundations, so it was all or nothing. You couldn't be a part-time Sahaja Yogi. I don't know if that answers your question.

Yes, that's a new one. I've heard of quarter-baked, half-baked Sahaja Yogis. "Part-time Sahaja Yogi" is a new one. But yes, you're right. There are so many people who are finding peace with Sahaja Yoga, but it's actually the one-to-one relationship with Shri Mataji one has, as the pure spirit, that really makes all the difference. And it's all easier said than done, given that in many ways, life was much simpler back then. You didn't have internet, social media. You could only be then and there in one place with people, not like now where you're just bombarded with information and people. So that's a very good point.

Jeremy and Felicity, thank you for bringing back together the importance of the purity of the brother-sister relationship and how important it is as a Sahaj family, as a Sahaj collective, to maintain that and take it forward to the next generations.

Would you please tell us... you were saying, Jeremy, that Shri Mataji was telling you everything from how to clean your teeth to how to meditate. Is there any other advice that comes to you that you'd like to share?

Yeah, I particularly remember in Chelsea Road, and these talks weren't recorded. It was just sitting around Shri Mataji very spontaneously. It was like sitting with your mother or grandmother or an aunt around the log fire and telling stories. I remember one thing particularly that has remained with me as such an important message.

She once said, "You see, the problem with you people," she was saying generally, "is you want to do Sahaja Yoga. You want to grow spiritually. So it's like you want to play the game, but you don't know the rules." This game has rules. And Indians are far more knowledgeable about things like maryadas, protocol, how to evolve, what is involved, what you need to do, the punyas and the tapas. But we had no idea, absolutely no idea.

So it was quite funny, she gave an example. It's like, so you want to become the spirit, okay. But to become the spirit, you have to let go of your ego. So I arrange something to happen in your life, and you say, "Oh my God, no, please Mother, not like this!" So it's like we want to play the game, but we don't want to sacrifice or go out of our comfort zone or play by the rules. Because we can't decide the rules; it's the Divine who decides the rules.

This is something I've seen very often, that people have conditions. Like, "I'll become a Sahaja Yogi if you do this, this, and this." Like she said, you must have heard the talk where she says, "Oh, I've been in Sahaja Yoga three months and my economical situation hasn't improved. What's going wrong?" It's not like we can make the rules. On the contrary, very often our economic situation gets worse, because whatever needs to happen to your ego or to your situation to make you grow, to make you become the spirit, it will happen. So again, it's a bit like you have to be careful what you want, because becoming the spirit really means letting go of everything. All Mother wanted was complete surrender, complete surrender in every sense of the word.

That sense of peace that is so deep and intangible, and all those spiritual feelings that go beyond words... and when you touch that, you go, "Yes, this is what I want." So all the other is just like being in university doing exams. It's all the learning process to get to the pinnacle, which is what we want and what she wants. That's really so deep. I'm so thoughtless now, just to enjoy that bliss and peace in total surrender to Shri Mataji who's... I'm hoping you're going to ask Jeremy about some of his experiences in Italy, so get him on a nice memory sharing. If we freeze, we can continue.

Yes, go on, please, Jeremy. Share with us how Shri Mataji then became from this lovely, very approachable, loving mother, grandmother, or aunt figure to...

Wait, let me say, this picture that you are conjuring... it wasn't quite like that. In Mother's presence, your chakras were turning and clearing and spinning, and sometimes it could be really uncomfortable. You'd get odd thoughts. She'd make you realize, "I shouldn't be having these." So it wasn't quite like sitting with your mother and grandmother. That was the maya surrounding the spiritual experiences that were going on. So I just wanted to...

Well, thanks for that clarification, Felicity. It's so beautiful that you all share these memories because for us now, it's not many years since the times you are sharing with us happened, and yet it seems in a different realm altogether because it's not in a tangible, so-called reality. So yeah, please share with us, Jeremy, about those times and how then it changed and progressed.

Okay, I'll give you an example. I mean, it was a small group, so obviously it was a totally different dimension. She would ask about your family. She knew my family because I brought them to a meeting in London, so she knew my father, my mother, and my brother. And she would ask about them. When she saw you, she would ask, "How's your mother?" She would be genuinely interested and probably also working on our chakras and things like that.

And she would work on you individually. There would be moments where she would be sitting there, you would bow down in front of her, and she would work on you personally for, I don't know, 10-15 minutes or something. Then she would work on someone else. So it was a hugely individual attention. You had a very, very intimate, personal relationship. And that was amazing. It really was something unforgettable and game-changing. It really was. You can't recognize someone you don't know. To recognize someone, a friend on the street, it's because you know them from before. You can't recognize someone you've never met before. So recognition implies that you've known her before, in some life or some capacity or in some dimension. You have that connection.
