Thank you for joining again for the second session of the photos with Shri Mataji and the golden moments that you spent with her. This is a lovely photo of Shri Mataji's holy lotus feet at the weddings. Would you please share with us your memories of that?

Yes, definitely. The weddings were held quite regularly after the initial few years, and I was being persuaded to get married every year by Shri Mataji. It was difficult to overcome my belief that to really get your full enlightenment, one had to be single.

Eventually, Mother did get me married. This photo shows her feet, and you can see some remnants of kumkum there. This was after a puja, and her feet had been cleaned and so on. Then Shri Mataji—I was going to say "my mother," which she is—asked us to put it on her feet.

Oh, beautiful.

And I took this photo. Now, my wedding, as some of the old leaders used to say, was a major saga of many years. Since I wasn't too keen, it finally occurred. I'll give a quick glimpse—this is us getting married. You can guess who the guy is.

The person I got married to is a yogini, Rajni, from Pune. And that also relates to one of the things you asked me after we stopped recording, which was about the exhibition in India.

That's right.

Yes, so this was on one of the India tours, actually in 1985. I was staying at the back then because there were lots of new yogis who obviously wanted to be close to Mother. Suddenly, I heard Mother calling me at one of these exhibitions. I went through the crowd to the front, and she just pointed at a table. There were some fancy writing pads there, really pretty ones which I would have never bought, all decorated. And she said, "Buy this."

Of course, I bought it. I picked it up. Then she moved along and said, "Come, come." She pointed at a pile of envelopes, also beautifully decorated and matching, and said, "Buy this." So I bought them with no clue as to why, because there was no need to ask. After a while, we left the exhibit, and days passed. The tours used to be two months long at one time, but since I was working, I could only do one month, half of the tour.

One morning, after coming off the buses the previous night—and those were challenging times—I was sitting with the yogis taking vibrations. I was with the collective, and I felt a tap on my shoulder. It was an Indian yogi, and he said, "Mataji wants to see you." I thought, "Wow, this is bad," because I had been ill. I was coughing. The bus rides were terrible with the dust and everything, so I was physically unwell. Of course, the vibrations told me there was a lot of tingling, and I was thinking, "Good God, I've got to go see Mother."

So he takes me out, and I sit at the back of his scooter and he scoots along. Then he stops at some shop to run some errands. I'm sitting on the scooter, completely clueless. Eventually, he gets me to a yogi's house where Mother was staying. I walk in, and Mother is sitting on a sofa at the far end of the room. The room is full of Indian yogis; none of the Westerners were there. They were all back at the camp where I was.

This is in Pune or Ganapatipule?

Yes, this was in Pune. I went in and I thought... I mean, for those who have been before Mother, you just don't want to go in feeling catches. And I knew I was not in a state to be there. But anyway, I made my way through this crowd, tiptoeing or stepping over people, and got to the front. As I went to Mother's feet, my head was swimming with the thought I would be told off because, in Sahaj, nothing is secret. I go down to Mother's feet and then I hear a voice saying to the leaders, "Look at his vibrations. Feel them. Feel his vibrations."

My brain is going, "What?" And the leaders are going, you know how they say in Marathi, like, "Ha, ha, ho, ho," that kind of stuff. And here I am at the bottom going, "Okay." Then Mother moves her feet to let you know you can get up, and she says, "Come with me." She leaves all these people—the room was full, so there must have been about twenty leaders and Indian yogis—and she takes me down a hallway into a side room.

I go in there and I see a local yogi lady. Her name was Mrs. Chevaleca, we called her. Mother goes and sits down on the bed. There's a girl in the room, an Indian girl, and I have no clue what's going on. I go in and sit on Mother's left, and the girl is sitting on Mother's right. Then Mother introduces her, tells me, "This is Rajni." There was no advance warning, absolutely not. Then Mother says words to the effect of, "I'm going to get you engaged to her." I'm thinking, "Engaged?" because that wasn't the case in the old days. You just went there to be matched if you wanted to be.

You wanted to be matched, yes.

And get married. Mother talks to Rajni as well, in Marathi, I think. Then Mother opens her purse and says, "Oh, let me look in here." She says, "Oh, I seem to have two rings."

Surreal.

I didn't know what was going on. I just couldn't think. She takes these rings out. She gives one to me and one to Rajni. She tells me to put a ring on Rajni's finger, and then she tells Rajni to put the other ring, which came out of Mother's purse, onto my finger. And she said, "Okay, now you're engaged. And keep it a secret. We don't want anyone to know." I'm going, "What?" I'm telling you, it was just... I don't know. Then she says to Mrs. Chevaleca, "Okay, now you're the witness to this engagement." And then Mother said to me, "You have to write to her."

"Okay."

And I'm like, "Right." She said, "Yes, you have to write her letters regularly." And obviously, she had made me buy the pad a week or two earlier. I was blushing. I mean, I'm probably blushing now, but with dark skin, you can't see it.

Amazing. Especially because you had this conditioning or this approach that if you're a spiritual person looking for the eternal truth, then Brahmacharya, you just stay single and carry on with your seeking. And here's Shri Mataji giving you...

She probably suspected I might have done a runner if she had told me beforehand. Who knows? I probably wouldn't have dared to, but yeah. So that was it. Then we were told it was all the rage because Mother used to tell me that I needed to learn how to be a romantic.

So what's the kind of advice that you could give to perhaps some of the listeners who might appreciate...

I did not receive advice. She just told me that. And then she took me to watch some movie in India. You won't believe it. I was so embarrassed by the whole movie, sitting next to Mother.

Watching a romantic movie.

Oh my God. I don't know why I'm telling you all this on video. We may have to delete this. Anyway, she said to me, "You've got to give Rajni some of the love you have for me." And I was thinking, "What?" Anyway, to cut a long story short, Mrs. Chevaleca was sort of a point of contact. So we would go and meet in her house. Mother would say, "You've got to go meet her." So we met once or twice.

Later, Mother told me about her history. I found out that her parents had come to Sahaj and then she had joined them. Her father, when he was getting older, apparently went to Mother and told her, "I give you my daughter." And Mother accepted. So there was always that special relationship where she always seemed to treat Rajni like a child, which was a very nice thing to see. So yes, I guess that was the background to me being suddenly married. Now, I was blissed out, which is why I'm smiling like crazy.

Beautiful couple.

Yeah, because Mother had given me the same garland that she had been holding and showing people. And she gave me the same shawl that she had been holding and showing yogis how to dress. It didn't help but be in a very nice state. I was also late for the wedding, by the way.

What did you do to the garlands?

It's somewhere. It's all in a box. We moved, and we've got boxes in the garage that haven't been opened for nearly 25 years now. But yeah, we kept a lot of it.

It's just wonderful mementos indeed.

Some of the yogis, they're realized souls waiting to be born. You've got to get married and things like that. The end result, three-plus years after we got married, was our first child, our daughter. As soon as Mother found out that there was a child on the way, she kept monitoring everything and telling us, "You must tell me when the baby is about to be born." So when the time came and we went to the hospital, I called Mother. She was in London; we were in America by that time. Mother said, "Okay, keep me informed and call me as soon as she's born."

So I did exactly that. As soon as she was born, over the phone, Mother described exactly how she looked. I was just standing there in a daze. She said, "Her hair is really long and thick, and she looks like this and that." You already know who Mother is. And then she said, "You will call her Priyambada, one who speaks sweetly and auspiciously." And she said, "In America, they like short names, so you just call her Priya for short." And so that's what we did. Mother told us, like many yogis know, that you keep her at home for 40 days.

Yes.

We did that. Two days after the confinement, on the 42nd day, we hopped in a car and drove from Cincinnati all the way to New York, where Shri Mataji was, to see her. My daughter did not want this photo shared, but as a doting dad, I did. So this is Mother with Priya when she was one month and a bit old.

Oh, so sweet.

And as soon as Mother held Priya, she started talking in baby language. And she went on and on, I'm serious, for the five or six longest minutes. That's how it seemed to me, like an eternity. And Mother was going, "Ah, ah, ah." Priya stopped her baby talk. Mother looked at me and she said, "She's told me everything." You can imagine, I thought, "Oh, good God, what did she say?" There were lots more photos, but I won't show you those. Anyway, that was the end result of getting married. Here was the baby who talked to Mother. But most of the little children were fantastic.

This one was born a few years before Priya. He was an amazing child. Now, his dad, whom you know as Gregoire, passed him to me because he was babysitting at that time in one of these seminars. He said, "Hold Nachindranath." And I said, "Oh, sure." I'm not kidding, I thought, "I'll take this baby to look at some flowers," because I used to always go into a state of meditation. I carried him, I felt these vibrations, and I went completely silent. And we both went and stood and just looked at these flowers. English roses are beautiful. We were in complete silence. Later on, when I was walking around with him, someone took this photograph. And that is Nachindranath, who is now a grown man with children.

Yes. In Switzerland.

Yeah. Wow. Amazing.

Those children of the yogis, I mean, they are something. It's very interesting how you were talking about Priya's conversation with Shri Mataji as a one-month-old baby, and this photo of Nachindranath, which transported you to a meditative state.

I'm telling you, that child, if he ever watches this, I hope he's disciplining himself so he returns to those states. I know he's very good; I've met him. And his vibes are still good, but not as good as when he was a baby.

No, that's just pure innocence, isn't it? Life and responsibilities...

Yes. So you have other things to pay attention to. Yes. And then this is Pratishthan, when Mother was designing it. So those are the blueprints there. We got married in January and then we stayed on a little bit. Then we went to England and then came back for Mother's birthday, I believe. We were here for a few weeks and were fortunate that she let us stay with her.

So whereabouts is this design being made?

This is all in Pune. It's in Pune.

So that's a small altar there, isn't it?

Yeah. So that's the architect there. I always used to find it funny that people put a photograph of Mother in a room where Mother is. I mean, she's already there. She definitely does not need it. Anyway, the poor architect had a tough time because we were there for a part of it. Mother would always send him away with a new plan. He'd come back having redrawn it, and then she'd change it again. He would be quite perplexed, but he was a Yogi, so he was fine.

And who has just moved further back?

Oh, that's Dumal, who used to be the leader of Rahuri. He'd done a lot of Sahaj work there with his family. And that's Rajni, a month or two after we got married. I don't know who this man is, but I've seen him on the tours.

Okay. Wow. Beautiful.

And a week later, it looks like a different day. Mother's changing the plans again, reviewing the changes that she gave him. I think his name was Patankar or something like that.

Patankar, yes. Yes. Patankar.

Yeah. So that was Pratishthan. When Mother built it, she gave us a tour of the place some years later and was explaining how she wanted it to be a museum of Sahaja Yoga. She showed us the upper floor and was telling Rajni and me her plans. So way at the beginning, she'd already planned for it to be a museum for Sahaja Yoga, for all the things related to it and all the gifts she was given that were meant to be placed there.

And this was March '86 during the birthday week.

It'd be in Delhi?

No, no. All this was going on in Pune.

Oh, I see. Okay.

Yeah, a lot was going on there. It was a long time period, at least from my memory. I'm hoping it's correct. When Rajni comes back, I'll make sure, and then we can stick a correction underneath. Okay. So this is Kalva. Kalva was for the puja.

Okay. Yes. The New Year's puja used to happen in Kalva.

Yeah, so it's Kalva. On the birthday morning, we were there. Mother was sitting on a sofa and talking to one of the local yogis. A couple of them had come in to visit. She was asking them to feel the vibrations and we were looking on.

Wow. Those eyes, those are the...

Oh, and this was the birthday puja. Maybe you can tell me what or who Mother is looking at up there after the puja.

It doesn't need to be told, actually. It's so obvious.

Yeah.

So beautiful. Beautiful isn't an adequate word.

Yeah, I know. Just no words in the language.

Ah, this is... okay. Bob Dylan. So before Sahaj, I was listening to Bob Dylan and really liking all his lyrics. There's a song called "Shelter from the Storm," and when I re-heard the lyrics after Sahaj, I thought, "This guy is writing about Mataji." Anyone who would like to can go online and look at the lyrics. Rajni also had heard it, of course. She had to listen to quite a bit of my decadent music after we got married. She wrote all the lyrics down, and I made a tape recording of it.

I went to see Mother, and at that time, again, the front room was full of Indian leaders discussing programs and problems and whatnot. We kind of made our way through the people who were waiting for Mother and went into her bedroom. She wanted to listen to it there and then, while the leaders were still waiting outside. So I think we brought a little tape recorder with us. We played "Shelter from the Storm" for Mother, and she listened to the whole thing while she was reading the lyrics. Then she said, absolutely, it was about her. She even said that he wrote it when she first visited America, which was not when she was doing Sahaj programs.

Amazing. That is amazing.

Yeah. In the early days when I came, some of the old yogis told me that they'd asked Mother about some of the musicians they listened to. Apparently, she replied that Bob Dylan and Eric Clapton—I'm talking about in the '70s—one of them was realized and one of them was awakened. I don't remember which was which. So we know that the song he wrote is special. The whole tune, the way he sings it in his raspy voice, and the lyrics are very moving. Worth listening to.

Yeah, it brings to mind one of the poems... it's a song that is taught as a poem in the A-Level equivalent syllabus in India, at Shri Mataji's school in Dharamshala. One had the privilege to teach it to the students—the futility of war, given what's happening today. He's really pictured it so well, how the mother sends her young son in the hope that it will bring pride and honor to the family, the medals and stuff, which is so meaningless. Because when the son returns from the war, he's lost his limbs, totally disfigured. He hands the medals to his mother and just keeps walking away. She couldn't recognize her own son. It's a lovely, touching poem. You can see that he's not just any ordinary poet, singer, or artist.

Yes, yes. He was definitely very special, Bob Dylan. And all the verses are so relatable to Shri Mataji. But the last verse is simply mind-blowing. At the end, he says, "If only I could turn back the clock to when God and she were born." I mean, the recognition, the understanding was just... wow.

We'll have to listen to that song.

Yeah, definitely. And here, of course, I always find this funny. Mother reads the books about herself, reads the names, and goes through it carefully. She doesn't talk about Maya. I mean, she really plays it all so perfectly.

Whereabouts is this? It's a lovely throne as well.

Oh, I'm afraid I can't say. One of the older yogis who sees it will recognize the chair and so on. It's a beautiful photo.

Yeah. And there's one photo that has come down purely by accident. I think it was supposed to be somewhere else, but I have not used PowerPoint since I stopped working in the corporate world almost 25 years ago. I might have pushed pictures to the wrong place, but let me try it... oh, this one. Suddenly, Mother started tearing up during the same event. I just found it so moving. It's like the compassion for her children and the state of the world. I have no idea what caused it, but I was there with my telephoto lens.

Which year is this?

This is after we got married, so I think after '86, in the '80s. I'll find out the dates in due course. It might be earlier, I'm not sure. So what I did was, I saw Mother's face and I wanted to see what the rest of the divine body was doing. So I took a close-up of her hands at that time, and then of her feet. You can see that just being... yeah. When I took these photographs out, I didn't need anything else for quite some time. It was not only fully satisfying but very joy-giving.

And this is Mother at Stonehenge. This is chronologically out of sequence; it's actually from 1980. The way it worked was, I told you in '79 that the TM movement people came to us in Cincinnati when we had the breakthrough. From then on, TM sort of went downhill, and these yogis helped to expose the terrible things that were done. Two of the top four leaders came to Sahaj. Only one stayed; the other one eventually left. But a lot of the teachers came to Sahaj as well. So, it made quite a change.

Anyway, in 1980, one of the directors who was with us was saying how great Stonehenge was and that there were great vibrations. I think we were doing a tour of the South of England again this time. He was quite insistent—they were all quite insistent. They were not like the earlier batch of yogis who let Mother decide what we did or where to go. That group seemed to feel, "Here are the places we should go." And Mother allowed her children to have a little leeway. So we made our way there in quite a few cars full of yogis.

We made our way to Stonehenge and walked up there. These yogis, the former TM people and others, put their hands up. And this chap who had brought Mother there said, "There are no vibrations, Mother. There are no vibrations." Mother smiled and she said, "That's because out of respect for me, they are not emitting their vibrations. I have to give them permission." Then she looked at the stones. A few seconds later, she said, "Okay." And then the stones started emitting vibrations.

Wow. Amazing, uncle. I think that's an amazing story. We'll take a pause.

I tell you, everybody was just in complete silence.

Of course, yes. It's a phenomenon. It's a phenomenal photo. And really, really beautiful, given not just the location, but the importance of it all, isn't it?

Yeah. She, like some of the names say, can open and close the door to realization. She turns it on and off because it all comes from that source.

Absolutely. The master programmer and the source of the power generation.

On that same trip—I may have mentioned it in the previous video—we were driving back, and I was sitting with Mother in the back seat. She was on my right. The same guy who was driving us, a nice guy, was complaining about the forest fires because we had had a lot of them. He said, "We haven't had rain." Mother's response was, "But there are lots of trees in England," something like it doesn't really matter. But he was really concerned and kept saying, "The fires are bad."

I looked at Mother because I thought he was going on a bit. Mother looked out of the window to the right. In the far distance, there were some clouds. She just looked at the clouds. For non-yogis, it will be hard to believe, but the clouds started moving towards the car at an amazing speed. I am not joking. Mother was following them, or I should say directing them, with her eyes. She turned her head from the right upwards. She didn't say anything. He stopped talking for a while. We got back to her place, and the next day on the news, they said there was unexpected rain and the forest fires had been put out.

Amazing, amazing story. I'm speechless. It's just the power. And to be a witness to that, wow.

The other aspect of it is that it was something that, from Mother's view, was unnecessary because England had plenty of trees. But because one of her children requested it, she went ahead and satisfied him.

Amazing. Only a mother can do that.

Okay, uncle. On this note, I think we'll conclude this session.

I think so. I think it's perfect. And I think you have tasks to take care of, being a mother and a wife. Also, it's getting late here.

It's lovely to talk to you. Thank you so much. Regards and love to you.

To our illusory world where we still have duties to perform.

Thank you very much, uncle. Thank you so much. Bye-bye.

Bye. Bye-bye.
