A general day, did she just see people all day, generally? Or how did it work?

Well, sometimes Mother would ring you up. She'd just pick up the phone and say, "Is Mataji here?"

When we had our first Brighton meeting, she said, "I think I'll come down to you." We wondered, "How is Mother going to get here? Is she just going to materialize?" It turned out Mother was going by train. But how did Mother go on a train? So, I was in the car with others to meet Mother at the station, and we were late. Then you could see Mother coming off the train like a mother duck, with the Sahaja Yogis behind her. I realized I wasn't late, because Mother was just arriving. She said, "See? The train waited for us." I thought how great that was. I thought I was late, but it was Mother who was just arriving.

Yes. Yes. We were living in the Dollis Hill ashram. I was quite new; I had just moved in. Mother would ring quite often. Once, I picked up the phone and said, "Yes, Mother," and quickly took my shoes off.

Shri Mataji was always gracious. We hadn't had a seminar for some time, and I was very aware of how the seminars really brought us all together. I felt it was really hard to keep the heart open in the collective with the yogis. Anyway, to cut a long story short, I decided to ask Shri Mataji if she would like to have a seminar at my parents' place while they were away on holiday. I'd always been a dutiful daughter; I'd never done anything like that, never had parties. It was a very hard decision to make. But when I finally felt, "Yes, Mother would be happy with this," we wrote an invitation. My parents had just completely done a renovation, and the big loft mill room was empty. It was perfect, in the countryside in Dorset.

There are little stories that go with this. Someone said to me, "You have to give a formal invitation to Shri Mataji. That's the proper way to do it," even though I had already asked her at a meeting and she had said, "Yes, yes, good idea." So I wrote a little invitation and asked if the theme could be "Keeping the Heart Open." I had to go and deliver this invitation, and I was working all week. The only day available for me was Sunday, which turned out to be the day of Princess Diana and Prince Charles' wedding. I thought, "Well, I'd like to watch this on TV, but never mind. This is the most important thing."

So I went on the train. All the streets were empty; everyone was either at Buckingham Palace or watching on TV. I arrived in the lobby of her building, and I was always very aware of who Shri Mataji was and my own insignificance. Alan Richards arrived just then, and I said, "Oh, you can take the letter up. I don't have to go." He said, "No, no, you should come." He said, "Any bad feeling is not you, it's negativity." So sweet. So we went up in the lift. I sort of hung back, and he went forward and rang the bell. Mother opened the door. I said, "Shri Mataji, I brought this invitation," and she opened it and said, "Oh, come in, come in! We're watching the wedding on the TV."

So we went inside and sat down. She was sitting on the sofa with C.P., and I sat with Alan Richards. She invited me in. It was so amazing because she was watching the TV, and they were up at the altar. Princess Diana made a mistake, and Shri Mataji went, "Oh, look, here's Ego coming up," and she gave him bandhan like this. Then a few minutes later, he made a mistake. "Ah, that's better." So amazing.

So we went ahead and arranged the seminar down in the countryside, and 70 yogis came. It was part of a tour Shri Mataji was doing. She went on to Bristol and Exeter afterwards, but I think she started with our seminar. We went to meet her train from London, and as I was going, I thought, "Oh, I haven't got any flowers. It's Sunday. Everything is closed. I can't meet Shri Mataji without flowers." So I went into the garden. There was one single rose. Nothing else. We got to the station, and my whole attention was on flowers. I must have some flowers. And there were these yellow weeds growing. I went over to the station master's wife and said, "Could I pick these?" And she said, "Oh, yes. They're just weeds."

So I picked them. It's an interesting story because it's not what you give, it's how you give it. Shri Mataji responds to the heart that gives, not to the gift itself. So she came off the train; I can still see her, Shri Mataji in her sari. She had traveled with the public, with one or two yogis. She joked about one yogi who had been giving her some problems. She said, "I just played a little trick. He got left behind." So sweet. She got off the train, and I gave her the flowers, feeling they weren't what you'd want to give. She just went, "Oh, so beautiful! What fragrance!" Later, she actually used it in her talk. She talked about the fragrance. It was such an example of how Mother responds to your desire.

It was a very amazing weekend because you have the Goddess in your house. I mean, you just cannot put into words what it feels like. And for me, you can't make the place like you want it to be for her. It was just an ordinary house. I bought new sheets for the bed, different things.

We had this beautiful puja in the big empty room, and so many sweet things happened. Shri Mataji really taught us not to be fanatical, not to be ritualistic. There was no place for that. Sahaja Yoga is about love, and that's what she showed us all the time. Sometimes, as a mother, she could be strict and say, "Don't do this. This is not good," because a mother wants her children to be balanced. But you always felt that love come through. She would correct, but then she would balance.

I remember one of the yogis was very tired. He'd been preparing for the Exeter program and was really exhausted, but Mother was there, so he came. He could hardly stand up, he was so tired. Mother just turned and said, "Oh, you're so tired. Go and lie down. Go to sleep." It was so practical. If you're so tired, rest your body. It needs balance.

Then we had the puja. Because I was the host, she said, "Oh, Felicity, you come up and help do the puja." I was such a mixture of excitement and nervousness; I just could not relax. She said, "It's okay. You sit down and you just be here," near the front, which was much more comfortable for me. So we had 70 people in this house. After Shri Mataji left, I went around, and Rosie stayed to help me clean up.
