 (England)

Thank you for taking the time for this session on the times you spent with Her Holiness Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi on the various properties she had in England, Italy, and India, particularly Pratishtan. It had been foretold by William Blake; he called them the "golden builders." So, it's really a privilege to have some of Shri Mataji's golden builders here.

I'd like to start off with Pat, if you could tell us—and this question is for everyone—briefly, how did you get your realisation? Where were you at that point in time? If you could put a timeline, that'd be great. And what was your first experience of meeting Shri Mataji like? Pat, please.

Well, I went through it in the other interview. By the time the golden builders type of stuff started, we'd already been with Mother for quite a while, years even.

The other thing about the golden builder setup was that it was quite different from most things that took place with Shri Mataji because it was a very rough, tough, chaotic atmosphere. There was lots of stuff flying about, lots of rubble, noise, dust, and walls falling down or being knocked down. So the way we interacted with Mother wasn't quite the same as usual. Mostly, you would be lost in awe of Mother, in meditation, and listening to her. It would be an extraordinary atmosphere. When Mother was there and we were doing building work, it was kind of different, and Mother would get quite involved in it all. She'd be around all the time.

I remember in Brompton Square when someone put a nail through a pipe and there was a water leak. I jumped up and yelled, "There's a leak!" at the top of my voice, turned my head around, and found myself facing Shri Mataji about two feet away. I felt like a complete idiot. But this is the sort of thing that went on, with Mother mixed up in it. So it was kind of different.

Interviewer: So what's your first memory of working on a Sahaj property of Shri Mataji? Was it Chelsea Road?

Pat: No, it was actually Mother's house in Oxted. She decided when she was going to sell it that she wanted it decorated. It was me and this chap called Gus, and we had no experience in decorating work at all. We had no idea what we were doing. There were these tiny cracks in places, and we gouged them all out into these huge chasms and then tried to fill them. It looked like they were just bodged up with chewing gum. Then we painted them, and it looked like a film set for a film about earthquakes. Sir CP never said anything, but he used to give it extraordinary looks. We just did our best. The people who came to look at the house to buy it stared at it as well. I don't know what happened, but the house ended up getting sold. So that was my first experience.

After that, nothing much happened until, I suppose, Brompton Square. Although at some point around then, we had all these housing co-op properties around London where we used to do all kinds of work. We used to get them to rent, or rent-free actually, for periods of six months or a year for this housing co-op that was organized. We had to do all kinds of odd jobs to clean them up and get them okay. In a couple of them, I did work on the gas and central heating and stuff like that. Brompton Square started in 1981, so it was around about that time.

Then at Brompton Square, we probably did the most work. But I did work in Chelsham Road probably before that, before we got married in 1980, because I was working there with another yogi. When we got married, there was no roof on the meditation room at Chelsham Road. We had to put polythene sheeting over it with balloons and things. So, I did some work there on the meditation room, and then it was probably Brompton Square.

Interviewer: We've had the privilege of looking at some of the photographs of Brompton Square. And the other day, the housewarming was shared on one of the evening meditations. It was a really beautiful house with so much handcrafted work. Can I address this question to Laurent? Because Greshna, John, Fergie, Derek, and Alan, you've kindly told us about how you got your realisation in previous interviews ages ago. So, if we could have Laurent, please.

Laurent: Yes, I met Shri Mataji a few months after my realisation, actually, in 1980 in a program in Zurich. My mom's aunt was the seeker in the family who had tried and experienced everything. She was working with Gregoire's sister in Switzerland. When she discovered Shri Mataji, she gave me a call and said, "Forget everything I ever told you about anything. Just drop everything and come." She was like the guru of the family in a way. So, I quit my part-time job, dropped everything, and within a day, I was on the road to Zurich, across France and Switzerland. I met my aunt there and got realisation in the evening.

I didn't quite understand much of the speech; it was translated for the Swiss Germans, and my English wasn't that good at the time either. But for the first time in my life, I didn't think anymore. I didn't need to think. I was just enjoying myself in the present like never before. There were no more problems, no more worries. Ideally, I would have liked to stay on that chair for the rest of my life, just sitting and enjoying the moment. There was nothing else to be asked. It was quite amazing.

Following that—that was a Friday evening—we spent Saturday in Arnaud de Calmont's apartment in Zurich. On Sunday morning, I rang the bell of the apartment to maybe join them again. I had a minivan and was sleeping in it, the little white van that all the colleagues here know about. Shri Mataji had called the yogis for a puja, which I didn't know, obviously. The yogini at the door wasn't going to let me in at first. So, I asked what was happening, and she said, "Wait here." She went to ask Shri Mataji, and Shri Mataji said, "Oh, the new guy is here. Let him come." So, I had my realisation on Friday and was washing Shri Mataji's feet on Sunday. I was so blissed out that nothing mattered. I was just on a cloud, and everything was wonderful.

I came to England in 1981. Shri Mataji came to France for a seminar and she actually asked my mom for permission for me to come to England for a month or so to help with her house. I was supposed to go for a month; I didn't know it was going to turn into four years at the time. I was meant to fix the doors on the kitchen. So, I said, "Great, I'll go." We bought the oak doors in France and I brought them to England. It was the first time customs didn't look in my van when I drove through with it full of oak doors and tools.

When I arrived and saw Brompton Square for the first time, I asked, "Okay, where's the kitchen?" She said, "Oh, that's this room." There was no concrete floor in that room. I said, "I'm just here for a month to fix the kitchen doors. Who's doing the kitchen?" She said, "Oh, you are." I said, "What do you mean, I am? I'm just here to fix the doors."

When Pat mentioned that in Brompton Square we broke down walls, I think what got broken down the most were all the egos and conditionings we had. Shri Mataji worked quite strongly on knocking down all the big walls we had in ourselves. That was quite challenging. I don't think there's a single one of us who didn't have a moment where we thought, "I'd like to be miles away from this place. It's just getting too much." But we have great memories.

From there, it went to a house in Victoria. Shri Mataji would ask you to come for something to Ashley Gardens, near the McDonald's, and then she'd order McDonald's for everyone. Beautiful.

Interviewer: Thank you very much, Laurent. Could we ask John to tell us about your times with Shri Mataji? What was the first property that you worked on, and what was the experience like?

John: That would have been Ashley Gardens. Well, I say "work." I offered to wash all the carpets in the flat, which Shri Mataji kindly agreed to because I wanted to make all the carpets soft and springy for her feet. That was difficult because as soon as I started working, it was just a bombardment of thoughts as the negativity was coming out.

As Pat was saying, the early days of Brompton Square were very messy, with walls being knocked down and a lot of soot and dust. I think a lot of yogis were wearing balaclavas and things. I remember Shri Mataji saying, "I can't recognise any of you, but I know you by your vibrations," because we'd all be in these weird costumes.

Each house had its own different quality and special vibration, but I think Brompton Square was the most intimate with Shri Mataji. As Pat was saying, she would be around all the time. In the very early days, she wore the same shoes, sari, and headscarf because she was hands-on herself. She was showing us how to stain varnish and I remember she told some yogis off for putting the filler on the walls too roughly. She was showing how to do it in a very smooth way, so there was very limited sanding down.

It was cold at times, and there was a midnight shop down the road. Yogis took great delight in buying Shri Mataji sausages because she once said she liked them. So, she'd get a never-ending supply of sausages. But Brompton Square was very, very beautiful. It was like a jewellery box. As soon as you entered, it had the beautiful screen on the left, and everything was real art and craft. All her beautiful things were within there. And once Shri Mataji was there, of course, then it was complete. Brompton Square was a very special place. We were spoiled and completely blasted there; it was both extremes.

Interviewer: Could I ask Fergie to briefly tell us where his journey started and what was it like?

Fergie: Housing-wise? Okay. I had discovered that Shri Mataji was going to leave England because Sir CP only had a four-year term. I had just got my realisation and didn't know much. Because I was a qualified plasterer, I thought I might as well move down to London and find out more. So, I moved into Chelsham Road. Later on, Shri Mataji said to me, "I'm buying a new house. You can come and work there." But in the meantime, she had the house in Ashley Gardens.

I remember she asked me to go there to move some boxes. There were lots of other Sahaja Yogis there. While I was there, the phone rang. Somebody was making some complaints about me, and I was like, "Oh my God." I was behind Shri Mataji's bed, so I couldn't move. And she was saying, "Oh, really? Oh, is that true? Fergie this, Fergie that." I was thinking, "Oh my God." Then she put the phone down and said, "Don't worry. I know everything." We were all involved with dramas, but Shri Mataji had us there to see things. So sometimes we're in a house for other reasons.

Then, I started work on Brompton Square. What had happened is that the builder was ripping off Sir CP and he hadn't put in the main staircase. So, in the beginning, Shri Mataji couldn't walk around the house to see what was going on. One day, a Sahaja Yogi named Danny went out, bought a brand new staircase, fitted it himself, and then Shri Mataji walked around the whole house and vibrated it. That changed a lot of things.

I don't know if you know, but building workers have their tea room with all sorts of things in it. So every few weeks, Shri Mataji would get us to do something in those rooms so that their negative vibrations wouldn't stay too long. Then one day, the builder came to the house. He was a kleptomaniac. Shri Mataji had asked him to come in to tell him off. He was big and really arrogant because he was taking all the money. Just as he came in, on the left, there was a cabinet with little trinkets. He picked up one of the trinkets and put it in his pocket while waiting for Shri Mataji. I saw that and thought, "Wow." Then I thought I needed to say something. I said to one of his workers, "Can you tell your boss to put that thing back he just stole from the cabinet?" He was completely oblivious that he'd put it in his pocket. So I took it from him and put it back. He was on the back foot, and then Shri Mataji came out.

I don't think many people have seen Shri Mataji in "wrath of God" mode. Sir CP was normally dealing with the builder, so I don't think he'd seen Shri Mataji like this; she was usually quiet. She just blasted him. He was completely finished after that. He made sure the workers did the work properly, and everything went much better.

The builders had a hard time because the Sahaja Yogis didn't have any tools, so they kept taking the builders' tools. The men would say, "Where's my hammer?" and it would be at the top of the house. I was the only yogi with tools on the building site, so I was chasing after my tools all day. By the time I went up to the top floor and found one, I'd go back down and the next one was missing.

After the builder left, one of the workers enjoyed our company so much that he asked if he could carry on working there, which he did. But he complained that every morning he would come in, his whole body would break out in a rash because he used to drink gin. When he came into the house, because of the vibrations, he would come out with a rash. We were telling him he needed to get his realisation and do Sahaja Yoga. Every room had a drama. That was my first initial time.

Interviewer: Great, thank you for that. Could we ask Alan, was Brompton Square your first experience working at Shri Mataji's house?

Alan: Yes, it was. I can't remember whether at that time I was living at Chelsham Road or at Nightingale Lane, probably Nightingale Lane. I can just remember walking into Brompton Square, walking into the universe with all the yogis trying to sort out all the problems of the universe and untangle them. Shri Mataji was basically clearing us out. I don't think it had anything to do with the building work; it was more to do with us cleansing ourselves through the work we were doing.

Like I think John was saying, everybody was dressed in balaclavas and bobble hats and weird outfits. And I thought, "Blimey, this is really weird." They were all stripping wallpaper off the walls, causing destruction basically. Nobody had an idea of what they were doing. But it was great fun.

I remember Sir CP paid the builders, and the first batch of builders ran away. They didn't do the work after he paid them. This was the way Shri Mataji sort of arranged for the yogis to come in. She said, "Why don't the yogis come in and do the work?" And of course, Sir CP was very grateful and very nice to everyone. It was wonderful.

I was just amazed at what havoc there was everywhere. But Mother didn't mind. She was joyful about everything and would come around and tell us what to do. I also remember later on when the builders did arrive, this thing of the tools. They were always shouting, "Where have the tools gone?" They'd call the Sahaja yogis "the loonies" or something. "What have the loonies done with our tools?" We would drive them mad because they'd get a tool back, and then 10 minutes later, it would disappear again. So they really didn't know how to handle it.

Apart from some labouring on building sites, I hadn't done any building work. Shri Mataji said, "Oh, you're going to do the carpentry." I think Laurent was the carpenter. She started me doing little jobs around the house. When she used to meet people, she used to say, "I taught Alan carpentry." And it was true. She taught me everything I knew about it.

How old were you at that point, Alan, if I may ask? We're talking 1981.

Briefly, not precisely.

About 25, maybe. Yeah, mid-20s.

Okay.

Or maybe something like that. Because I got my realisation when I was 23, that was in 1979. So we're talking ‘81, ‘82.

So how was your journey from Bristol into the thick of things in London?

God, it's so long ago. It's so far back now, pulling these things up. Well, I'd been in Bristol. Fergie got his realisation in Bristol, and he very quickly realised that he wasn't going to get the information he required and decided that he was off to London. After he'd done that, and I'd been around for a while—I'd been in Cheltenham on my own for a year, just giving people realisation, telling them about Sahaja Yoga—which was great, actually.

When we came to Sahaja Yoga in those early days, we didn't have any information. Now we have so much information. I think we had one sheet of paper. It was "A Unique Discovery."

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it was written by Shri Mataji.

Yes. Don't tell me if that's true. Was it Shri Mataji?

I think it was a draft of a speech she gave.

Ah, was it? Okay. So we had that and a chakra chart, and off I went in Cheltenham for a year, just giving realisation. It was such a great experience. I had no fear about it. I'd had such a transformation within myself and such a faith in Shri Mataji that all the crazy things that were happening around with Sahaja Yogis or whatever, it didn't matter. I just knew who she was.

So I would just approach everybody, anywhere. I can remember very clearly being in a nightclub. I was a barman in a nightclub as a Sahaja Yogi. I wouldn't call myself a Sahaja Yogi at the time, but I had my realisation. I’d just start talking to people about it, and before you know it, I'd have a big crowd of people around me. They were just amazed at the things I was telling them, but at the same time, I think they thought I was probably a bit of an eccentric. In those days, to say you meditated, you had to be a bit strange. It wasn't accepted like it is these days.

I went to Cheltenham for a year. I had a girlfriend at the time as well, and went through a lot. I got quite attacked, I think, because of that. So there was a whole process in that year, and we ended up getting split up. I went to Bristol because my sister was here, and spent some time here. Like Fergie, I decided I would go to London. So I moved up to London, straight into Chelsham Road ashram. That was an experience, arriving there.

There was a girls' dorm and a men's dorm. I don't know how many men... there must have been about 10 to 15 of us in the room, in our sleeping bags, like sausages.

Like sardines.

Like sardines or sausages. Shri Mataji actually likes sausages. We all say sausages. It was my first night there, and I got into my sleeping bag on the floor, thinking this is all a bit strange. I lay on my side—no mattress, just a sleeping bag, head on the floor—and all of a sudden, I felt this warm sensation in my ear. I thought, what's going on? It was one of the yogis of the past that is no longer around. I think he was called "the monk" or something because he always had a massive scarf around his neck. So he was wearing a balaclava or something all the time, mid-summer, with scarves out here and a bobble hat on. And he was pouring warm mustard oil into my ear. He knew it was my first time in an ashram, and didn't ask me, didn't tell me he was going to do it, and just poured this oil into my ear. So my whole faith was in Shri Mataji, but the Sahaja Yogis, as far as I was concerned, they all seemed like complete mad people.

How long did it take to recover from that?

Well, you just went into this witness state, really. There were so many things going on. In the men's room where we all were, everybody had their different routines, so everybody would have an alarm clock, and they'd all be set for different times. An alarm would go off about 2:00, 2:30 in the morning. The first alarm would go off, and the person would start doing all their ceremonies, whatever they were doing. That's the one with the bobble hat and the scarves. And then one by one, the alarms would go off.

We also had another yogi in the room that would sleepwalk, and he would do the most extraordinary things. He would build brick walls, have fights with his pillow. One morning, he woke me up at about 3:00 in the morning, shaking me. He was saying, "Meditation time. Meditation time." And then he woke up in the middle of that and said, "Oh, oh, I was asleep," and went back to bed again. So yeah, it was a very interesting time living at Chelsham Road, but I learned a lot there.

Those alarm clocks... I remember in Chelsham Road, we only had one bathroom and about 30 people living there. Everyone had to set their alarm during the night to go and have a bath.

Well, this is the thing, wasn't it? Chelsham Road was a building site. It remained a building site for many years. It was only really when it was bought by another yogi that the work eventually got done there. So yeah, it was an interesting place to live.

When you were saying about the routines, everyone had their odd routines. One yogi, he would go for his wash, and before going for a wash, he'd lay out his sleeping bag, put loads of bandhans on his sleeping bag, bandhans on himself, come back, and then put more bandhans on his sleeping bag. Then when he went off for his wash, every night, I'd go and get this ostrich—because this was my routine—and I'd stick it into his sleeping bag. As he would ceremoniously pull the cover back to get in, there'd be this ostrich, and he would just chuck it out in disgust. Every night. It's the only way I stayed sane there.

Oh, dear. It's very strange, because we never had these things in the ladies' room.

Did you not?

Basically, from 5 o'clock in the morning until 11 at night, the ladies spent their time in the kitchen with little breaks, because we were cooking all the time. We were cooking breakfast. Everything was falling apart. The kitchen was upstairs. Whatever you tried to fix in Chelsham Road when I was living there—and it was until the 5th of December 1980, when I got married—everything was falling apart. You couldn't really fix anything. You'd fix one thing, something else would disintegrate. In the kitchen it was a similar situation, so it was quite hard. Lots of people were living there, as you could hear, but there was this tiny kitchen with just a couple of ladies, or maybe sometimes people helping, but we were just non-stop cooking and washing up. I was thinking—I was very new at the time—I was thinking, "Is this my life?"

Roughly how many ladies and how many gentlemen were there in Chelsham Road at this point?

I can't remember. I know that it was me and Chaya permanently cooking, but there were ladies who were going to work, you see. There was Anne. So maybe there were five ladies, but they were coming and going. It was very difficult to say because they were visiting.

Yeah, there were quite a lot of visitors that came. When the room was full of that many men, it was probably when people came at weekends or something, so we were really squashed in.

I went to Chelsham Road from abroad for Sahasrāra Puja in 1981. We went from France to England for the first time, and I had heard of Chelsham Road where the yogis lived together. I think my realisation in Switzerland was all neat, tidy buildings and tidy yogis. I expected a beautiful white house, shining with shining white yogis, nicely dressed. When I arrived there, it was a bit of a shock somehow. I said, "What's happening?" I had no idea about this aspect of Sahaja Yoga. I mean, I lived in Chelsham Road some years later. I remember there was a little mouse living in the kitchen that had been named Roderick. It used to come out every now and then.

I should say, there were more than one mouse there. You should be careful with any vision of a mouse.

I do remember one particular... Go on. You can speak, Alan.

Oh, right. No, I was just going to say, John was such fun. He was a joy when I was in Chelsham Road because he was the one that I could feel was really sane. Well, there were others, but John seemed like a guy I could say anything to. And he was very devoted to Mother.

The person they were talking about, the one with the scarf, he was quite good with me. One time I was kicking my left big toe on upturned pavements. You know, when you kick your toe, it's like... So I said to him, "Oh, I keep kicking my left toe." He said, "Oh, that's left Nadi." He said to me, "There's no such thing as accidents." That's all he said. And then I completely understood what he was saying and how to resolve the issue. So, he was like a pujari.

Saying that about "there's no such thing as an accident," Shri Mataji used to say, if anything happened—if you dropped a cup or knocked something over—she'd say, "Put yourself into bandhan and say Shri Ganesha's mantra." So the tiniest thing would come back to your subtle condition.

I was just about to tell you this thing about John. John would like to be worked on, as I would like to be worked on, and everybody likes to be worked on. But when you worked on John, it was a full-on thing. Lots of beating, lots of massage. Anyway, on this particular occasion, I had a real pain in my Hamsa chakra. I mean, it really was painful. So John started working on me, and there was a lot of beating involved and fun for him, lots of fun. But this pain just wouldn't go away. Eventually, when John had got fed up and everything he was doing didn't get rid of this pain, I decided I was going to shoe-beat it. I went into the garden and I said to myself, "I'm going to shoe-beat this until it goes." I was beating away, and after 3,000 hits on the ground in the garden, it suddenly went inside my head like that and completely disappeared.

Wow.

I remember the accident you mentioned. She was in the room—I was sitting alone with her—and she was drinking tea and telling me exactly what we talked about, that nothing happened by accident. Even a drop of water falls on a specific spot on the ground, even that's not an accident. And as she was saying that, a bit of the tea was leaking and went down her neck here. She said, "And you see this drop of tea coming down here? It's just to point out that you have a problem with your Vishuddhi now. So I have to put my attention on Vishuddhi right now." It's very, very sweet.

She had this one amazing trick she played on me to switch off my brain. I was thinking, obviously, like a few others maybe. I was working in the corridor on a skirting board. I was there and she arrived in the house. I gave her a flower. Then she moved to walk toward the room, and I went down to the work I was doing on the ground. As she walked away, she said in French, "Merci." A French word. My brain couldn't take it. My brain went, "Okay, you're French. You're in England. Shri Mataji speaks English." That French word totally disconnected my brain. My brain just went "pop," like that. It was totally disconnected. I was like this. And I looked over at Shri Mataji, and she looked around and gave me a little look like, "Got you." She totally pulled the switch. That was quite an amazing moment.

Sorry, there's a little bit of a lag on the line. At this point, can we welcome Hade, who's driven all the way from Cabella to Vienna and actually made this session. Thank you so much for joining us. Would you please share your journey in Sahaja Yoga and the first property that you worked on as a "golden builder" for Shri Mataji?

Yes, I got my realisation in '85, in October '85. I deepened into my realisation then in Edinburgh, where the collective was maybe twenty-fold at that time. There was Melody Blythe and Alan Richards and a few other, mainly ladies, there at that time. My first experience meeting the collective was obvious when I came into the room, because I got my realisation out in the sticks in Cupar, Fife. And even though at that time we were still drinking and smoking pot and all sorts, I always felt this feeling of the Kundalini coming up.

I finally went to the first meeting where I met Melody and the rest of the yogis, and for me, it was just obvious that that was it. That was the answer. Then the first time I came down to Shudy Camps, it was for Shri Adi Bhumi Devi Puja. It was quite an experience for me because we'd already arranged that we'd come down to the Puja, but I missed the bus which they'd rented. And I said, "No, I have to go." So I jumped into my car, filled it up with petrol, and started driving down the motorway. Heading down from Scotland to Cambridge, there are about three different ways you could come, but for me, I just started driving.

Within about an hour of driving down the motorway, my Kundalini just started getting stronger and stronger. And then all of a sudden, I saw the bus that they'd rented, where the yogis were inside. They were driving so slow on the motorway. It was just incredible. We stopped off at the next village where we could pull off, and we drove all the way down until we arrived at Shudy Camps. We arrived around three or four o'clock in the morning. My Kundalini was soaring; apparently, they were working on me from behind the whole time I was driving. I thought, "Okay, I'm just going to go for a little walk and have a puff."

I was walking down the drive with Elliot, who was the son of Melody, and I lit the cigarette, took a puff... and the vibrations went. I looked at the cigarette, knew what it was, threw it away, and that was my last cigarette ever, actually. That was quite an experience for me.

What was the first meeting with Shri Mataji?

The first time I met Shri Mataji was down in Shudy Camps. At the Adi Bhumi Devi Puja, I was just so engrossed in how many people were there. And I was fascinated with the children because the vibrations from the children were just fantastic. I just found myself playing with them. The first time I actually met Shri Mataji was when I then came down to work at Shudy Camps. I'd taken two weeks holiday and ended up staying four weeks. And I remember just before I left that first time, John telling me, "If you don't come back, I'm going to come and get you."

Do you remember that, John?

Not so much, but you've said it a few times.

It was a really strong connection with John. At that time, I think it was his humour, and we just connected somehow. There weren't very many people I connected to because I was very shy in those days.

The first time really speaking to Shri Mataji, I think it was '86 or '87. Shri Mataji had given out a whole load of presents to yogis at one point. Quite a lot of the yogis got a present and I didn't get anything. I was thinking, "Okay, it's not my time." Then again, Shri Mataji came back from India and she had presents for yogis. She called me and she gave me a watch. At that time, it was one of these Seiko gold-plated watches that she was giving everybody else the year before. I was just so touched. We didn't really have much of a conversation at Shudy Camps. I wasn't really such a talker; I was just very happy being there and in the collectivity.

For me, the most wonderful thing was to see how... I just enjoyed the collectivity. The vibrations just held everything together, I found. There were always problems, but there was also the fun things as well. We had so much fun being together that the problems were less than the fun that we had. And the problems became less and less as we grew together. There were exceptional situations at some points, when we had big, huge discussions that time when Warren was found out that he was messing around. I think I was in Brighton. Bill was angry and wanted to completely annihilate Warren. And there were people there like Gavin and David, and they were trying to smooth the whole situation down and trying to calm everybody. That was my first real understanding of what was really going on. I got so ill there from all this turmoil. I remember I just went to bed. I didn't want to be bothered with all this stuff. Then I remember waking up the next day, and I think John worked on me. After John had worked on me, my Kundalini was completely soaring. It didn't bother me what had happened the day before. These old memories really still stick in my head because I think that's where the bond to a lot of the older yogis then happened. This bond is so strong that there's nothing that can shatter your acknowledgement of this friendship.

Can I ask Hade something? Do you remember that time I came in a car and picked you up? You were nearby the house. You must have got a bus or something to the local village, Linton or something. And that was the first time I met you. So I came with somebody in the car and then we gave you a lift to the house. Do you remember that?

I can't remember. I remember Hade, when he came to Shudy Camps, he was very balanced, actually. You say you were shy, but you were not really that shy. You were just full of joy, I think, from what I can remember.

Yes, true. You were wondering how you could cut your hair and get away with it. I remember this because you wanted to cut your hair, but your mum wasn't happy about that.

I cut his hair in the end.

Is that because you're a Sikh?

No, he wasn't a Sikh. But he had very strong, very long hair, but it was cut. It was like a really springy bush, I remember it well. And I was sort of going into hysterics at the whole situation. It was wonderful times we had together, really. There were always times where the laughter would be out of control. Well, for me anyway.

I seem to remember Harry wearing a turban when I first saw him at Shudy Camps.

I don't remember that. I never had a turban on when I came. No way. I just had a lot of hair. The turban had disappeared already when I was 18. I used to always wear my hair long. Maybe you had a bobble hat on.

The first time I cut it, my hair was virtually down in between my knees and my calves.

Wow.

And the first time I cut it, it was down to about my lower back. And then John cut it short.

Gave you a John cut. It was a head-shot cut. Everyone got a shock, I remember, when I came out of the bathroom. It was all gone.

Brilliant. It's one of those characteristics of Shri Mataji that she used to make everybody laugh. The feeling of joy and tranquility that was there at the same time... it was a different atmosphere in her presence. Would you like to share some of those moments with Shri Mataji, when you were working in different properties?

I just want to say one thing about Brompton Square, about the wall. Do you remember what Shri Mataji asked the builder to do?

Oh, in Brompton Square, that was the bathroom wall. He finished it and said to Shri Mataji, "What do you think?" And she said, "Yes, I like it quite a lot. It's pretty good. But could you just move it about 18 inches that way?"

That's brilliant. It was a wooden wall, so we had to take those enormous nails out, demolish the whole thing, and kick the whole thing back.

About Shri Mataji's sense of humour, I could tell you Mother's leader joke, if you like. That was hilarious. She was complaining about the leaders spending so much money on giving her presents. She said, "I keep telling them I don't need these presents. What am I going to do with them? They're taking up so much space. So I said, 'You just give me something small.' So they would come with a diamond, and that would be too much. 'You give me something practical,' and they'd bring something on a crane for doing something." She went on and on, saying, "It's just these leaders. They keep giving me all these presents." And she said, "Worse than the leaders, it's these deities that keep helping them!"

Shri Mataji loved it when we were having fun together and she would create situations where it would obviously end up being fun. There was myself, Alan, and I'm not sure if it was Laurent or one other person. She got us to put oil on our heads, and she really got us to put a lot on. That was in Pratishtan. That was with you, John. Three of us sitting together with our heads really oiled. And she was just looking at us and laughing. She said, "Looking like royal family."

I remember we walked into Shri Mataji's room in Pratishtan, John and I, and we asked her a question about the work we had to do. We walked in there, and we ended up each getting an oil massage from Shri Mataji. Then we came out totally blissed out. We had forgotten about the question. And we said, "Oh, what about those questions? Oh, well, never mind." That was quite the experience.

What an amazing privilege. My God, Shri Mataji giving a head massage.

We had to move furniture around quite a lot, and to rearrange the furniture, it'd often end up as it originally started. But there was one time she was getting us to move lots of mattresses around. She wanted the mattress from her bed swapped for the mattress at the very top of the house. With the vibrations, we were charging around with these big mattresses. We came charging back into the bedroom, and Shri Mataji was waiting for the mattress to come. The other yogi pushed it in a way that made me fall, and I fell and the mattress fell on top of me right at Shri Mataji's feet. She absolutely roared with laughter. She threw her head back. But she was really enjoying the fun. She loved it when we were all having fun, and she would take on these different aspects. She'd be like one of the boys, one of the lads, laughing and joking. She'd be Mrs. Srivastava making sweets for C.P.'s diplomatic guests. She loved it when we had fun together.

I remember Alan was laughing or something, and Shri Mataji walked into the room and he went all serious, like a naughty boy. Shri Mataji said, "No, no, I'm enjoying your laughter."

I just have to bump in there and say, John was actually laughing because we were together. We were roaring, and Shri Mataji walked into the room and just like two naughty schoolboys, we stopped. We said, "Oh, sorry, Mother." And she said, "No, no, no. I love to see you having fun."

Even when she worked on us, it was one time in the little room downstairs in Brompton Square that was used as a workshop, the front room on the street side. Shri Mataji never used to come to that room normally, but that day she came down and she started working on my Vishuddhi. I was on my knees and she was cracking my neck the way she does it, which is basically going very quickly to shock you out of it a little bit. She worked on my Vishuddhi. And then I remember the rest of the scene, like out of a Tom and Jerry cartoon. We were next to the workbench, and she looks on the table and she sees this big claw hammer. She grabs the hammer and turns toward me with it. I thought to myself, "I'm going to run now." I started running and she was running after me with a hammer all the way down the corridor. At the end, we both laughed and she said, "Okay, next time you catch a Vishuddhi, I'll treat you like this." I still have the hammer, by the way.

I just wanted to say about Shri Mataji's creativity, because you remember, John, you were doing the plaster moulds for Shri Mataji's bedroom. And how she used a chocolate box, the top of the chocolate box, as a design for the plaster work.

It was a table. No, there were two things in there. One was a tin and one was a table. I just remember the table. It had embossed roses in it.

It was a tin, and they opened it out longways. At that time, I was making the moulds and John was putting them up. It was a biscuit tin with embossed roses, and we cut it out, laid it out, and made a mould from it. It was incredible. We used them all around Mother's bedroom. The roses were painted in gold and pink. I never knew that it came from that.

And also, we had to get some glass paint, and we had to paint on the chandeliers, pink. You remember the chandeliers? They were originally white, and we had to make pink designs with this paint. But also, she wanted something in the hallway, in the ceiling. She just wanted some designs. So what she actually asked us to do, she asked us to put some pieces of glass on the Persian carpets and paint the design of the carpets with the glass paint. First the designs, and then we had coloured paints and we filled the designs in. All these designs of the Persian carpets were up on the ceiling as well.

Fantastic. They were on glass ornaments.

Wow. It's so imaginative. Because they were so beautiful, these designs, and then they ended up on the ceiling, reflecting it.

About the plaster moulding you talked about, she often made us do things we had absolutely zero idea about. At some point, me and Danny were supposed to make these plaster lines in the big dining room downstairs for this plaster plate to go in between. So we had this kind of a wooden thing with a metal profile. We'd throw the plaster on the wall and run this thing to make the line. Of course, we had no idea about plaster. We put the plaster up, and it would set within seconds. We would throw away two huge buckets per day of plaster. We'd do 30 centimetres on the wall that day. We were trying everything. We were not progressing. The plaster was drying too fast. So we tried to put some salt with it. We would mix salt with the plaster. It wouldn't quite work, so we put a lot more salt, and it started to work. But then the plaster would never dry because it was always so wet because there was salt in there. It was absolutely one of the worst moments we had with Danny, struggling from early morning to late evening trying to get the thing and just throwing most of it away.

The other thing is that she'd come up with completely original ideas. Before you showed the photographs, I've got some silk here that Mother got us to use as wallpaper in Brompton. It's silk cloth, and we used it as wallpaper. It's really hard to hang because it moves; it's not stiff. So we had to devise a method to get each strip really long and then glue it.

In Mother's bedroom, it was silk on the walls. Then there'd be ornamental plaster work around the edges and mirrors alternated with this silk wallpaper and the embossed rose design. It was beautiful. There were panels, wasn't it? Panels of the ornamental plaster work, and then the silk would be in the panels.

The silk all started when Shri Mataji had this mirror, and there'd be these golden horsemen that are at the farm now on either side of the stage. She said, "Fix some silk on the back of the mirror." And I said, "What should I use to fix it on?" She said, "Wallpaper paste." I said, "I don't think it'll really work." And Shri Mataji said, "Just try." Of course it worked. Many rooms in the house had that silk. It didn't have any paper backing, so it moves around and everything, but it did look really beautiful.

I remember one thing: how incredibly John managed to do that without putting glue on the silk. I thought, how did he manage to not put any glue on that silk?

No, you just put the glue on the walls. The way I did it anyway was to put it on, then fix it, and pull it off again. Then put the glue on the wall, then put it back.

I went through quite a bit because Shri Mataji kept on asking for estimates. We all learned everything we were doing there. I'd never done any wallpaper hanging or anything. Everything was learned there. I just used to go into a room and look at it and literally guess how many meters. It got to a point where I was going through something and Shri Mataji was telling me off for anything and everything, even things I hadn't done. I was on the run. The negativity was on the run, and it was getting worse and worse. It came to one of the final rooms, and it suddenly dawned on me while I was putting this silk up that there wasn't going to be enough. I'd been told off so much that in my head I was really thinking that I was going to be turned into ashes. I was really, really terrified.

I went to Shri Mataji, and she had the usual entourage of people following her around. They used to follow her around with their hands out, and every now and again she'd say, "Go do some work," and they'd all scatter slowly, and then they'd all come back, following her around the house with their hands out. She said, "Yes, John?" And I really spluttered it out. But instead of busting me, she said, "That man in the shop must have cheated me." And everything was all right after that, because I was so terrified. It must have driven something out. Then all the telling-off stopped, and everything was fine. I felt much better as well. Something had gone.

How many times, John, how many times did you wallpaper some of those rooms?

The place that was wallpapered the most was the stairs and landing. It went on and on and on. I must have really needed the vibrations. I must have had many problems to have been given so much work.

There was a wallpaper miracle where Lewis was one of the yogis, and he'd wallpapered along with someone else to surprise those away with C.P. on some function. When Shri Mataji came back, they wanted to surprise her. She was very pleased, but because of wallpaper shrinkage, there was this gap. The next day, Shri Mataji worked on those wallpaper panels, and she was saying how we should believe in the vibrations because they do the work. I have heard that she pushed the wallpaper together.

Can I just say one thing before I forget? John, you mentioned those golden horses that were at the farm. They go all the way back to her screen, to Mother's house in her screen. She had them there. There was a guy, not a yogi, who came to deliver something and he was looking at them and said, "What are they, symbolic of something?" And Shri Mataji said, "They're the riders of the apocalypse."

Yes, I've got a smaller version.

I just wanted to say, before we move to Shudy Camps, about Shri Mataji's ingenious use of mirrors in her house. In the entrance, the corridor was quite small. She put mirrors facing each other in the corridor. When you looked, the corridor looked really huge and you could look into infinity with all these mirrors reflecting. But also on the ground floor, I think it was in the basement where there was the dining room, Shri Mataji put mirrors up on the ceiling. It was quite low, so the room suddenly became really tall. Using mirrors was quite ingenious.

The dining room was beneath Shri Mataji's bedroom, and like you said, it was quite a low ceiling, but the mirrors sort of took the room up, so it made it feel higher. We spent many pleasant times in there with Shri Mataji around the table. But Shri Mataji used to go to sleep in the afternoon, and we used to go in and go to sleep as well. We'd go into the dining room and lie on the floor after the meal, while Mother was asleep. I remember at this time, I laid with my head underneath a cabinet and had gone to sleep. We were all asleep on the floor, and Shri Mataji walked into the room. I can't remember what she said, but we all woke up with a start. I woke up and banged my head on this cabinet I had stuck my head underneath. But Mother was very amused by it.

I remember watching a horror film with Shri Mataji at Brompton Square. When you enter the Maya of a movie, you get involved. Watching the movie with Shri Mataji, it was tenfold. I was absolutely terrified. There was one part that made us all jump, including Shri Mataji. We all shot back in our chairs and Shri Mataji said, "Baap re!" I remember I was completely terrified. She was commenting on everything, saying, "This person is super-conscious. See the way he's doing this," and saying, "See, nothing's growing there because of the negativity." Whatever she watched, she would be very enthusiastic about and enjoy from her point of view.

The most Maya-ish situation was we were watching a video of Shri Mataji, with Shri Mataji. And she was agreeing with herself and saying she was such a good actress and things like that. It got to the point where it was like there were two Shri Matajis, the one in the video and the one in the room. It was a really weird sensation, but it was interesting how she was enjoying her talk and agreeing. "Such a great actress," she said.

I heard about the vampire film where she apparently said, "Oh, the Sahaja Yogis need to watch this vampire movie. They have to watch this. So that's what will happen to them if they don't make it."

Yes, I’ve got my hand up. Krishna was mentioning the chandeliers. I thought I'd bring up a little story about the chandeliers, how we're all in Brompton Square and we're all in our own little drama all the time. Mother's untangling the knots within us. Anyway, we were sitting in the front room, the reception area, and Mother was sitting on a chair with the Sahaja Yogis around her. Eighty chandeliers, the pink ones, were going to be put around the house, and they were being distributed in these boxes into the particular rooms they had to go into. I'd been given the job with the clipboard and where each box was supposed to go.

There was a Sahaja Yogi that was taking these boxes up to the different rooms. I'll call him Richard, to save his embarrassment. Anyway, one chandelier... seventy-nine chandeliers were accounted for. They'd all gone off to the rooms. And he came down and said, "Shri Mataji, I can't find this chandelier. I can't find it." And she started getting cross with him. It was just a drama; she wasn't really cross, as we know. She was obviously working something out in him, but also me at the same time. She would say to him, "Go, go and have a look in that room." Off he'd scurry up the stairs into the room, and he'd come back and say, "I still can't find it, Shri Mataji." This went on for some time. She was sending him all the way up to the top of the house and back down again, and she was getting very cross with him.

I was standing there with my clipboard looking at it, and it slowly dawned on me that there wasn't a chandelier missing, that it was my fault. I'd seen people getting blasted by Mother, and I'd never been blasted. Slowly, this drama was going on, and I was thinking, "God, it's my fault. It actually isn't missing at all." I was trying to pluck up the courage to say something to Shri Mataji in preparation for the blasting I was going to get.

Anyway, he'd gone scurrying upstairs to the top floor, and I said, "Shri Mataji, I've just realised that there isn't a missing chandelier. It's my fault on here." She just stopped, looked at me with this beautiful, radiant look on her face, and this smile came across her face. She said, "Yes, I know." She said, "But whatever you do, don't tell Richard." And I felt very relieved to not get a blasting.

Of course. Here is the cleaned and formatted version of the transcript, following all your instructions.

It tells the plank story.

The plank story?

Yeah.

What, the one with a piece of...

No, no. We called them planks. It was a scaffolding board.

Oh, right. That's the best story. It used to tell us where to go and everything. It started with the wallpapering, just the ceiling, just a very small ceiling. And it was embossed paper, which ended up completely flat. And then it went from there. So, when we'd finished one room, we'd go and ask Shri Mataji where to go next.

She sent me to the very top of the house where the loft—the roof part—had been converted. It was sloping roofs, sloping ceilings. And she said, "Go to the top right one." In the top left one was a very hot-tempered yogi, and he had two of these scaffolding boards. I asked him if I could have one because there weren't any available, and he kind of blasted me out of the room, you know, eyebrows and everything.

So the only other scaffolding board was a really, really long one down at the bottom, down in the basement. Me and another yogi had to, as we were taking it gradually up from floor to floor, stick one end out the window and then get it around the corner. As we went further and further up, it was getting more and more difficult. So when we got to the top, we had to take the loft hatch off, place it into the loft, and then try to bend it into the room. It kind of got stuck.

While we were moving this thing around, Shri Mataji was coming up the stairs with an entourage of yogis following along behind her with their hands out. Shri Mataji said, "What's going on here?" And I said, "Oh, we're just trying to get this plank," as we called it then, "the plank into this room, Shri Mataji." The next thing I know, Shri Mataji got hold of this plank with me. We were both moving it backwards and forwards together. And all the yogis were standing there with their hands out, making suggestions.

So we were together, moving this plank around, trying to get it out of the loft hatch and into this room. Then she looked over and she said, "Why don't you take one of his planks?" Because, you know, this other yogi had two planks. So again, we were moving this plank backwards and forwards, and suddenly she just threw it down. She shouted this yogi's name very loudly, "Come here!" And he came out and she said, "Look at this plank. It's just like you, obstinate. Give him one of yours." Sort of going off on one and everything. He gave us a plank.

Then we had to take the plank, the one stuck in the loft, back down the stairs. We could feel that there was some maya going on. Anyway, coming back up to go to the room, I met Shri Mataji on the stairs and she just burst out laughing. It was just a play she created for this guy, who was very hot-tempered and not very helpful. So you never knew what you were going to get, really.

Shri Mataji telling somebody off... I mean, it's maximum vibrations, in the yogi's benevolence, of course.

What was it like?

Very powerful. There were about five of us, and one by one, she was blasting us. She was in a complete fury with one yogi; she threatened to throw him out of evolution. But I've never felt such strong vibrations. He couldn't move, I couldn't move. Everything cleared out. I remember my left Nabhi was still biting, and she actually asked me a question. I didn't have to answer the question because the left Nabhi just disappeared into nothing. It just went into coolness. So you knew that what she was asking was true. I didn't have to say anything. But yeah, the strongest vibrations I ever felt. And it's actually giving maximum blessings.

I agree with that. It was like the negativity within you would just scatter. It was unbelievable. Very powerful.

Well, for instance, in Cabella, we'd be working 12-hour days, seven days a week, getting blasted by Shri Mataji for all kinds of things all the time. Then a puja would come, and someone would do a little dance in front of her for five minutes and get praised to the skies.

We'd be working really late, sometimes through the night, and we'd all stagger off to bed. We'd all just be lying there, just about to nod off, and then the door would fly open and someone would enthusiastically say, "Shri Mataji wants to watch a movie!"

I tried... I just said I couldn't face it one night. I remember I just said, "I can't do it, I can't do it." And then everyone had gone, and I thought, "Oh, I have to go." So I staggered upstairs and stuck my head in the door, and Shri Mataji gave me a big smile and said, "I hear you're very tired, Pat."

We would remember watching hours of films in Marathi, laughing our heads off at big mustaches. We'd all be sitting there with our heads going like this, and then our heads going back one way or the other. God, it was a very significant time in laying the foundation for the New Jerusalem, wasn't it? It's just like chiseling so many things.

And Shankarji and I had the privilege to visit the house that Shri Mataji actually had constructed in Lucknow in the 1960s. It's in the shape of the Star of David, and the kitchen is on a different level than the sitting room, and the bedrooms and the bathrooms are arranged differently. You've told us about the mirrors and how the silk was on the wall used as wallpaper. Was there any other aspect that Shri Mataji took care of or suggested for design and auspicious purposes that you could share with us?

Well, in Pratishtan, she designed everything from beginning to end and was incredibly creative. She came up with all sorts of ideas, and most of the architects who were there were completely bamboozled by it. They couldn't understand it, but everything was like a new idea. She designed these pillars made of bricks; she just worked it out by building it up with her hands, the way the pillars would make round pillars but with bricks put at different angles. The dumbbells for the bedroom that I had to make, she designed all those, and everything really. All the stonework at the front of Pratishtan she got from some palace in Rajasthan, I think, and had it all reassembled in the front there. The whole thing was just designed. Then she got me to make loads of molds, both in glass and in concrete, and used them throughout the house in all sorts of different ways.

The main staircase... they built it, but Mother didn't like the way they'd done it, and she kept telling them to knock it down and start again. As soon as she was driving away off to another tour of Australia or somewhere, all the architects would start arguing about, "Mother surely couldn't mean that we should take them down." The last time she came back, she said, "What do I have to do? Take a hammer and break it myself? Knock it all down and rebuild it."

Were these architects Sahaja Yogis, or...?

Yeah, supposedly, but they were very different from us. I remember one was a lady architect, an Indian lady, and I was making these molds in concrete for the dumbbells. When I put my hands into the concrete to mix it, she actually screamed in shock that I touched the concrete. She was very, very not hands-on at all.

It was the same in Cabella. Shri Mataji designed all those pillars on the stairs and everything. But it did get to the point where Shri Mataji didn't have to say anything; she knew I knew which cornice, which coving went in which room. I was really grateful. In Ealing, I was sort of let off the lead and given this free rein. Also in Cabella, while I was putting the three angels up above the reception, I had all these people coming up to me saying, "Do you want to put them up?" and things like that. But I just carried on, and when Shri Mataji came back from somewhere or other, she looked up and said, "Wow!" So I felt really chuffed. It was good. It's like a glorious entrance to Shri Mataji's apartment.

She had fantastic ideas. They had the curved coving that, instead of going from the ceiling to the wall, she had it lower down the wall. Then she got us to put strip lights behind it so the light came out. In Ealing, I put all Shri Ganesha's within the coving in her bathroom, and there were angels flying along behind. She loved it. She absolutely... I wasn't there, but Padmini was there when she first saw it, and she was calling to CP to come and see it and everything. So we were very, very lucky.

The angel, the big one, I found in a shop in Cambridge. I was passing the shop and thought, "Oh, wow." So I bought it. I said, "It may come in handy." We took it to Shudy Camps, then I got a man down from Birmingham, a plaster expert, and he made the mold for us. Afterwards, we took it to Cabella.

There was a time when Shri Mataji was sitting at the front, looking out towards the fountain, and she asked to see me. I came up the stairs, and I saw I had a whole vision of the end of creation. No sunlight had been coming in her room because all the windows had been covered with plastic. I came up the stairs. Shri Mataji's face was very down and drawn. As I came up, Shri Mataji and CP had the big main doors at the back where the fountain was opened, looking out. I came up the big main staircase and just went like that. She turned to me and she said, "You see that angel up there? John Watkinson put that up, and I can see the vibrations." She said the vibrations are coming from that angel. Then she turned to me and said, "The scaffold which is outside... that needs to come down, or something's going to happen." And my whole... I just saw that picture of the end of creation which Michelangelo has done, and I was like, "Oh my God." I was thinking it can't come down because plastering needs to be done first. Anyway, we did it.

Just saying about the angel, and then the Ganesha which John was talking about, I found in a shop in Fulham. It was called Ganesh. I was walking around and I saw this little Ganesh and I bought that. We took a mold of that, and since then we've made a cast and we gave it as a puja present one year, a few years ago. So things are still going on now.

I remember there was a Hanuman Puja, I think it was in Brighton. We had decided to make a whole load of Hanuman figures out of polyester. We'd made one for Shri Mataji of virtually 90% bronze and we made about 500 of these little Hanumans at that time. That was a really nice thing. Shri Mataji was so overjoyed when we offered hers as a puja present. And then she was saying, "What? You made 500 of these?" That was really quite nice.

I never saw one of those, I don't think.

As much as she always encourages us to use handmade things and natural things, at the same time, she really was very practical. If something is not easily available, is there any kind of instance that comes to your attention that you'd like to share?

Well, there is a story about the kitchen, about Shri Mataji being practical. We had all the wooden doors with this sort of shape at the top, oak doors for the kitchen. So we brought a certain amount of doors according to the requirements, and when the kitchen was coming to an end, there were two cabinets which were open without doors because we didn't have doors fitting for them. So we had two doors which would have sort of fitted in the width, but one was longer, one was shorter. I said to Shri Mataji, "How can we... we could leave it open, put a glass front or something." She said, "No, no, no, you can..." She said, "Turn the doors around." So you have the rounded piece at the top. I said I'll turn the door like this and then cut them in length like that. They were fitting, but I said to Shri Mataji, "You can't put this round shape on the side. That doesn't belong to the style."

And she said, "No, it's near my last time, you do it." So I had to actually make one door smaller, which was a bit complicated, and I had to fix the door sideways like that. Which, of course, for my conditioned ego coming from a carpentry school, was a bit disturbing at first. She said, "You do it like that." And as if it wasn't enough to tickle my ego, every time a yogi came in the house, they would look at the door and say, "Oh no, you put the door the wrong way around." I'd say, "No, it wasn't me." Every single time.

Wow, amazing. I don't know if you remember the ceiling of our bathroom in Brompton Square. Whenever one of us needed a good clear out, she would send us to do something in the bathroom. We'd be boiling hot in there; everything would come out of us. It was so incredibly strong in there.

We have a video. I found a video Linda had given to somebody in Australia—South Africa, sorry—and then I managed to get a copy and put it back together. So it's on Amruta. Paul Winter made a video of the house. It shows every room.

Oh, brilliant. I remember talking about Shri Mataji's bathroom. I was doing some work in there and I remember finding lots of Shri Mataji's hair in the bathroom. I didn't know it at the time, but Shri Mataji has to give permission for you to have her hair. I think it's Kali, isn't it? God of death. Anyway, I gathered up this hair and I got a little wooden box and I put the hair in it. I had it for years, for a long time. I had it until we got married, I think. Had it in this little box.

Then somebody said, "Oh, you shouldn't have Shri Mataji's hair unless she gives it to you or gives you permission to have it." So I started to get really panicky about this box of hair that I had, thinking some grave thing was going to happen to me. So we took this box of hair... in Bristol, we have the triangular dock, which is the Kundalini of Bristol, and it has a jetty that goes out into the middle. On this particular day, the yogis, we went down there and we went out to the middle of the Kundalini of Bristol, at the end of this jetty, and sang Shri Ganesha's names and Shri Mataji's mantras and offered the little box of hair into the water. I thought, well, I should send it to the elements. So we put it into the water.

It was a day when the sky was absolutely blue. There was not a cloud in the sky. I mean, it was a glorious day. And as we got to the end of Shri Mataji's mantra, the vibrations were really strong and we knew we'd done the right thing. Then all of a sudden, out of nowhere, we got this little shower of rain on our heads. We looked up above us and in this clear blue sky, there was one tiny cloud just above our heads, as though it was a sort of confirmation that we'd done the right thing. We were given this blessing of this little shower of rain.

I remember being there, but I don't remember... I remember organizing the trip because I've got the map of Bristol which I showed to Shri Mataji years later to get it confirmed. All I remember is a light shower of rain, but I don't remember that you put hair in the water.

In '97, Shri Mataji said to me, "Come and see me before you leave to go back to England." So I had the map of Bristol. I first saw it—I bought it from the museum—and I brought it to her. I said, "I found this map of Bristol, and I think it represents every chakra." So I showed it to her and then she drew a swastika on there. So she saw more than what I could see because I didn't notice the swastika. She did it so fast that even now, I need someone else to sort of figure out exactly where it was, but it is authentic. Every chakra, like the Vishuddhi of Bristol, is the bus station where everyone goes in and out. So, interacting with Shri Mataji, you get to find out things years later.

I just want to mention before I go that everyone's talking about certain things, but what I remember is being on the building sites with Shri Mataji was like a cement mixer. When you put bricks in it and they go around, all the rough edges break off. So after a while, we're all like in a cement mixer, and then you put a little water in it, and after a while, they all become smooth and we all, you know, well-rounded, well-balanced.

You talked about building things, but there were the moments where she'd work on us and talk about more spiritual things. Like one time, she was explaining to me that you can combine mantras. You can say up to three names together. You don't put the 'Shri,' so there was the example of... you can say those three names in a row without actually... in a mantra. She said you can combine up to three names; you don't have to put 'Shri' at the beginning of each.

There was also a funny story where, at the beginning, I was very new, working in Brompton Square every day. I'd heard of foot soak, but that's as far as it went. One day, one yogi got an epileptic fit and got sick, and I was just sitting with Shri Mataji alone in that drawing room on the ground floor. She was telling me about him. She said, "Yeah, I know what it was like. It was like this, it was like that." And I could really see, wow, Shri Mataji really sees and really knows everything. She was describing it. Then she looked at me with big eyes, directly in my eyes, and she said, "And just imagine, he wasn't even foot soaking every day!" That's what shook me inside. I think Shri Mataji left after that. I went straight to the shop, bought a bucket, and put my feet in it. I've been foot soaking ever since. She had a very subtle way to very directly tell you.

Foot soak every night is very important, isn't it?

Absolutely.

Well, there was another little detail, a short one. One day, and there was no context for Shri Mataji to tell me that—I understand many years later better why she said that—she talked about lemons. She said, "If you bring vibrated lemons to someone in a hospital, that person has to pay for the lemon, otherwise they will not work." Because people have to take charge of their own negativity. They have to pay for their own negativity, so to speak. So whenever you get a clear out in the ashram or something, I say, "I want to pay for my lemons."

I remember with the foot soaking, at one point in Cabella, Shri Mataji said to me that I should do more candle treatment than foot soak. And she told me I shouldn't foot soak every day. So, I mean, maybe that's something else, I don't know.

Different. Everyone's different. Nothing's set in stone. Whatever works for each individual. I took some lemons and chilies to Shri Mataji to vibrate—seven lemons and seven chilies. I said, "Shri Mataji, can you vibrate these for me, please?" And she said, "What are you going to do with these lemons?" I said, "I'm going to put them under my pillow, Shri Mataji." And she said, "No, no, no. You've got to eat them."

Okay, let's share some photographs of Shudy Camps that Greshna has kindly shared. Does that bring back memories?

Yeah, of course. Sure does. Oh, yes. Wow, what an assembly of angels. That's at the back of Shudy Camps. That was the back garden.

Amazing. You can see me there in the brown...

Yes, I can see you. And there's my little boy. Lots of people there.

It's a beautiful Grade II listed building. By that time, the roof had all been done. So this is all the roof repaired. It was all stripped off, flat like an aircraft carrier, apart from the chimneys.

The majority of the timber work... on one part of the roof was completely burnt. The men who previously owned the house were a couple of gay men who'd basically done a botch-up job, just trying to repair it to sell the house at that time.

From what I remember with the roof, there was a few Australians... Paul Henderson and... Robert Henshaw. We have lots of photographs of the work on the roof. I don't know where they are.

I've got a... I made a Golden Builders Facebook site, and there's lots of photos there as well from not just Shudy Camps, also from Ealing and a few others.

That's the roof under construction.

What happened was that Shri Mataji had a very good idea. We ended up using sheets of, like, galvanized metal. It looked amazing. But the actual postman was very happy with us because he said for the six weeks when there was no roof on, it didn't rain. So he was saying all the people in the village were happy with us. But what happened, we took off all the old oak, and some people came around and they said, "Oh, can we have that?" I said to the man, "We'll let you know." And we discovered that the oak was valuable. So we sold the oak and used that to pay for the wood for the roof. And we got loads of lead delivered to redo it properly. And we had Laurent making the actual windows upstairs.

Amazing story.

The inspectors came afterwards to see what we were doing. Shri Mataji decided she wanted to lower her bedroom ceiling, so we had to hide that fact. While they were walking around, we were banging on the ceiling above them.

We actually lowered the whole of the roof floor. The complete upper floor was lowered one foot to make more space in the attic, because the attic would not have had enough headroom. But we had to keep this for the future because we weren't supposed to. I mean, it was a listed building.

That was the mould. That was from the coffee table of Shri Mataji.

Coffee table from Brompton Square. It all got shipped to India afterwards, all her furniture. So it would be at Pratishtan, probably. There's a Chinese cupboard that Shri Mataji asked me to paint white, and then all the details gold. That is in Pratishtan there. That mirror was a present from the Austrian collectivity. Fifty Austrians turned up out of the blue and suddenly started working on the house. Tremendous. People from all over the world. Tea breaks were wonderful. You'd spend time with yogis from all over.

The last two weeks we had a 24-hour shift. As we went to sleep, someone else would take over. I remember I was so busy in Shudy Camps, I hardly knew what was going on. It's the first I've heard that the ceilings were lowered and everything. I was just so absorbed in what we were actually doing.

When the grading, listing people, whoever they are, came to inspect the house, they didn't even know the floors had been moved. There was all this wooden paneling in one room, which the yogis just ripped out, which was all listed. But they didn't know.

That's the attic. That's where we were sleeping. I remember Pat going to bed with ear defenders on because of the noise of the snoring.

In the dining room, I remember Laurent putting a glass of water beside his bed in the night. And he woke up in the morning and it was frozen. It was frozen for two weeks. There was ice in that glass. I used to warm up the sleeping bag with a hair dryer.

That's me there. The stage... the structure of the oak from the roof was used within that stage.

Wow, so a big chunk of the oak was sold off to pay for the lead and the remainder was used for the stage. Amazing.

Yeah, we didn't know it was valuable until I made some inquiries. It wasn't Shri Mataji's plan; we just discovered that accidentally because some non-yogis came to the house and said, "We'll take it away from you for free."

Ah, Shri Mataji. That's the reception room. We knocked it all the way through. It was a separate room, so we just turned them into open archways all the way along.

I remember the ceilings being leveled out because the ceilings were all over the place. A lot of time was spent leveling the ceilings and the floors.

These were made... Chris Marlow made these things.

That's for the big tent marquee thing, wasn't it?

Yes. And they also then moved to Cabella. It was used there for a little while. The first stage in Cabella was built with them. We were always renting these tents, which were costing around £10,000 every time we rented them for a long weekend. Then Chris Marlow said to Shri Mataji that we could make it for half the price and we could keep it for the whole season. We glue-laminated them with Cascamite, which is like a glue made from ants. We had a huge bag of dry glue and we're mixing it every time we were planking.

It got to a point where we had to put them up. It was the Land Rover and my Saab that we used to pull them up. Douglas Fry, who recently died, we used his Land Rover and my Saab to pull them up. Heavy, heavy bits of wood. But we made good use of them, you know, there and in Cabella.

Anything that was going on in the garden, of course, Shri Mataji could see out of her bedroom window. So you'd often see her face at the window.

Okay, fabulous. So there are some photos of Pratishtan as well.

These are just the early part when I was there. There are some handwritten notes of Shri Mataji, which is interesting to see. You see, this is a drawing Shri Mataji did while I was there for what she wanted, showing me what she wanted. I was just doing the cladding. The concrete pillars were there, and it was just a matter of sticking the plaster or concrete casting around the outside.

And Shri Mataji is saying, "No bats, no beacons." Amazing.

This is the one in Pratishtan. The pillars that Mother invented. The geometry created out of the bricks for the pillars.

So Pat, you were there in about 1987.

Yeah, April, May, June I was there. Maybe July, I can't remember.

And then was it John who was there next?

Later on, yeah, after that. 1987 and '88. For about six months.

Myself, Laurent, and another yogi, Shri Mataji invited us to go to Pratishtan. And before we went, we were each given a chandelier. Do you remember, Laurent?

Not exactly, but I know we always carried a lot of things in our luggage.

She told us, asked us to take a chandelier each, but in a black bin liner. The leader got us Pakistan International airline tickets, and the security was unbelievable. They were constantly looking in our hand luggage. At the airport where we changed planes, we had to get off the plane, and there was a row of guys with submachine guns. We had to take our luggage from one trolley and put it onto another for the ongoing flight while these guys were standing there. They were constantly looking in our bags and everything. They asked, "What's in the black bags?" And we said, "A chandelier." And not once did they ask to look in these bags. Incredible. I think they were so dumbfounded that we had a chandelier in a black bin liner. Obviously, it was bubble-wrapped. That's what they told us to do, so that's what we did. We took it as hand luggage. It was a life-changing experience at Pratishtan, really. Very powerful.

Was it the same year, '87 then?

Yeah, it must have been '87. We were married in January '88. While working on Shri Mataji's house, every now and again, you'd be called for some reason or other, and then you'd just end up being there while Shri Mataji would be talking to someone else. You'd often not even remember how you got there; you were just there.

I was in the room with Shri Mataji, and she was speaking Marathi with this man. Every now and again, they kept looking over at me. Then suddenly Shri Mataji said, "What's your height?" So I said my height. And then she looked back and she said, "What's your age?" I said my age. And then she's asking me questions like that. Then she said, "Go and tell everyone to put your best clothes on. You're going to a marriage."

And I thought because she was asking about me, that I was getting married. Laurent and everyone were all laughing and joking. You know the expression, "my knees were knocking"? They really were. The shock of it, my knees were just shaking. I was off to get married. Everyone was patting me on the back, congratulating me and everything, and I was completely freaked out.

So we had to present ourselves to Shri Mataji. She said, "There's a tempo van outside. You all look very nice." And she said, "I want to speak to you, John, before you go, alone." I was really freked out by then. I thought, "That's it. I'm just going off to get married." She said, "The sister of the girl is getting married. If you like her, you can marry her."

So that's how it all happened. We were foreigners in this huge hall with all the Indians sitting on the floor, and they got these chairs out for us. We're all sitting in the middle on these chairs. And my knees were still going. I couldn't control it. It was the shock. But yeah, so it was very beautiful how she did it. She played this little game.

Brilliant. Thanks, John.

The challenge in Pratishtan... I was in charge of a team of about 15 carpenters to organize them. And Shri Mataji would say, "Okay, today you do this and you do that." So I would go talk to them. I just knew five words of Hindi to say, "windows up, door down." That's about the four words I could handle with them, and that worked. So I would give the instruction, and they would go off to do the work. It looked like we would do the work we were supposed to do that day. I was very happy.

But then Shri Mataji would come out of her room with the architect and say, "Oh, we could do this here. Get a couple of carpenters." And, "Oh, we could do that here. Get a couple of carpenters." By the time she finished her tour, more than half the team was busy doing something else. So there's no way we could do what Shri Mataji was expecting us to do that day. It was getting quite depressing.

At some point, I was so desperate about the whole situation. I said, "Oh, I've had enough. I give up." After lunch, I stayed in the room. I had a siesta the whole afternoon. I said, "I don't care. I give up now." And I saw Shri Mataji in the evening. She looked at me and said, "Oh, you're much better now." And then I understood.

Actually, we have to reveal a little secret, John. Until Pratishtan, John and I were probably each other's favorite enemy within Sahaja Yoga, to be quite honest. There was a sort of love-hate relationship. I think we even punched each other a little bit in Shudy Camps, but let's leave that behind. Anyway, one time in Pratishtan, John became sick. He had jaundice or something quite severe. And Shri Mataji told me, "Go and work on John." I didn't really want to come near John in those days. Now he's my best friend in the world, but in those days... so, I went to John. I said, "John, Shri Mataji said I should work on you." He said, "OK, do it." I don't know what happened. I worked on him, but I remember that ever since, he's been my best friend. I don't remember even having a bad feeling for him ever since that moment. Shri Mataji fixed that nicely by getting me to work on him. And after that, that was it.

Beautiful. Shri Mataji once said to me, "A guru doesn't give solutions. A guru gives problems to solve." And we all can testify to that.

When I got to Pratishtan, there was a big, long story. There were these Indian mafia people that were trying to get hold of Pratishtan. They wanted the land because it gave access to somewhere else, and they persuaded the local collector to try and stop the building work. There was no description in law of what kind of building you could have on agricultural land, and Mother used that loophole to build that huge palace there. And ruffled a few feathers.

Anyway, they got the police to come and serve a warrant saying that we had to stop work on the house because it was illegal. Everyone was in a big fizz about it. I was wondering what was going to happen, if bulldozers would try to knock it down or what. The guy who was in charge, Mother had given him power of attorney, and he signed a form agreeing to knock it down. Then Mother came back and found out all this was going on. She said, "No, no, no. If you stop work, it'll never start again."

So she got this guy who had power of attorney to take some strange medication, which made him act very funny. She got a psychiatrist yogi to write a thing saying that he'd lost his mind. And so she got his authority to sign the form removed. And that is typical of her kind of amazing way of finding ways out of problems.

The doctor declared him as insane or something?

Yeah, yeah. And he was all going around going, "Ooh." So the thing he'd signed agreeing to stop work was invalid. And the next person who got it didn't agree. So it was a big drama that went on for months, but eventually the house got built, of course.

Maybe I can tell you a story from Brompton Square. It was an unusual day, all very amazing. We sometimes think Shri Mataji can change from being unwell to being completely fit. Once I came to Brompton Square, I was on my own. I think the servant opened the door, and Shri Mataji wasn't there yet. Then suddenly, Shri Mataji comes downstairs. She looks very unwell. I was quite worried, actually. I was thinking I shouldn't really be bothering her.

So she's coming downstairs, her feet very heavy, and she's complaining about the human body. She's saying this... this annoying, sticky thing. I suppose for the Goddess to fit into a human body, it's not really easy. So she's complaining about her body. She comes down, she touches the ground floor, and suddenly she changes into a young girl. I mean, it's completely different. She's changing into a young girl who is actually gliding over the surface of the floor.

I've seen her like this all day. We were working together; it was complete harmony. I didn't probably have to learn a lesson, but I just learned to be one with it somehow. It was just so amazing for me. At the end of the day, when I was leaving, Shri Mataji looked at me and she said, "You have done a lot of work today, haven't you?" Actually, I was just following Shri Mataji, really. So this was my amazing experience to see Shri Mataji being so... from one aspect to another. And she was so fast. She was doing so many things all day. It was just amazing.

It just blows one's mind away. It's also at Brompton Square, wasn't it, where Dania had shared the story earlier where she and her mom were using the furniture polish. There was very little of the furniture polish in the bottle and they kept praising it, "Oh, very nice, how nicely we are doing it." And they were praising it so much that it actually flowed over from being very little to overflowing. It's just those extraordinary experiences which just remind us that we are in the presence of the Supreme Goddess, Shri Adi Shakti.

Can I tell you a story? In Mother's bathroom? People have probably heard this story before, but I'll tell it anyway. It's in the early days of my lessons of carpentry with Shri Mataji. I was learning, didn't really know what I was doing, but she asked me to build a cupboard or put some shelves in her cupboard. It involved wood. I spent probably a couple of hours trying to find the piece of wood that I needed for this particular job, going up and down trying to find tools.

Anyway, I found this piece of wood that was perfect for this job. I was in there and I measured it. I measured the space, measured the wood, checked again, marked the wood, and cut it. I measured the space where it was supposed to go, and to my horror, it was an inch short. I thought, "Oh no, it took me a couple of hours to find one piece of wood in the house that would do this job."

At that very moment, Shri Mataji walked into the bathroom and she could see that I was obviously a bit upset. She said, "Is everything all right, Alan?" I said, "Oh Mother, I've spent ages looking for this piece of wood and I've measured it and I've cut it. And now it's an inch too short." She just gave me that knowing look and she said, "Are you sure?" And I said, "Yes, Mother, I measured it twice and marked it and then cut it." She said, "Just try it. Put it in the space." And I put it into the space and it was exactly the right length. She stretched it. And then she sort of smiled and walked off looking very satisfied.

I'm so lucky that Mother was going to Rome. She was living at Nightingale Lane at the time, I think it was 1982. It was one of her first visits to Rome. Just out of the blue, I decided I was going to go to Rome to be with Shri Mataji. So I just jumped on a train and went all the way to Rome, got off the train, and was met by Guilhem, I think it was. He put my bag in a locker and we immediately went up, putting posters up around Rome. And I ended up staying in the flat with Shri Mataji. There were very few yogis there, and I spent two of the most glorious weeks of my life in Italy before moving on to France.

On one particular occasion, we went shopping in Rome. We'd been out for some time, and we'd been walking across the cobbles of the street. She was walking with very heavy limbs and finding it difficult. We said to her, "Are you all right, Shri Mataji?" Somebody did. And she explained to us that there were hundreds of souls hanging off her legs, begging for redemption.

She explained that this is what happens to us when we go out in our daily lives. There are these souls that want to come to her, and they know we're Sahaja Yogis, so they cling on to us. They don't mean us any harm, but they know that this is going to be a route to the Goddess. So she said, "You go out in the morning, you come back feeling very heavy. So you have your foot soak, put your hands towards the candle, and then all these souls hanging on to you go through the flame to the Goddess. And then they can take their rebirth."

It was very, very enlightening to hear this. That's why we felt so heavy sometimes when we've been out. It was very difficult to see Shri Mataji walking like that, virtually to the point of not being able to walk. She said that these souls are in a state of limbo. They can't take a birth; they're stuck. And so that's why they would cling on to her to be able to get this redemption and take another birth.

I was in the house, on the first staircase there. I remember being there and then looking around. Shri Mataji was at the bottom of the stairs. I turned around, and when I turned back, she was already at the top of the stairs. I was like, "Oh, my God." What people don't know, in the early days, anything you used to think of, she would sometimes explain to you what you were thinking. So it was good to only have good thoughts. When she turned back around and saw me flabbergasted, she said, "Oh, it's Sri Hanuman. He carries me everywhere." And she just carried on walking.

I remember when we were doing work in the house, she said to me, "Before you start work in the mornings, you should say the mantra to Sri Ganesha and Sri Hanuman. And then they will remove all the obstacles in the way of the work." So we used to do that. There was one time when... you think you want to do more. So one day I worked till late, maybe 10 o'clock at night, and finished off something. I got back home and then I came in late in the morning. She actually asked me, "Why are you late?" And I said, "No, I was doing this plastering on this ceiling for you." And she said to me, "I didn't ask you to do that." And I just realized that sometimes we want to do things to impress.

After that, because that was the first main house, I noticed that lots of people wanted to do things to impress Shri Mataji. And when she used to come back, she used to tell them, "Whatever you've done, take it all down completely." She didn't have this notion of, "It's done, so that's it." Even when we were working in Pratishtan, people would build a wall, and even if it was six inches out, when she came back, she would say, "Knock the whole lot down and do it again." She had no compromise for things.

When I finished the work at Shudy Camps, Shri Mataji asked me to go straight to India, to Pratishtan. But at the time, I just couldn't do it. So she said, "Okay." Later on, she came back to England and said to me, "You're coming to India with me." At that time I could go. I said to her, "Shri Mataji, I have no money," because at the time the tickets were quite expensive. She said, "Oh, don't worry. Just speak to the leader. He'll buy you a ticket."

So it was just the two of us. We traveled to India. That was '88. We arrived there, went to the leader's house. We got met at the airport by lots of Sahaja Yogis. They had a chair for her. We went to the leader's house. She was discussing lots of things about the India tour. What I noticed is people were making suggestions to Shri Mataji which were not practical, and she was correcting them. She was really practical. She didn't like people being ripped off just because the Westerners have got money.

When I arrived in Pratishtan, for the first week, she actually didn't speak to me. Nothing. Every day I would go to see her, I would bow, she didn't say nothing. So I just used to go to Pune. I found a juice bar, bought some English newspapers. And after a week, someone said, "Shri Mataji wants to see you." So I went to see her, and then she said, "Oh, you see all that plaster work which has been done? I want you to take it all off and do it all again." Because when I arrived there, I thought, "Why am I here? It's already plastered." She said, "No, take it all off."

And I was like, "Oh my God." So she said, "I'm going to give you people to help you." So I had some little boys, maybe 10 or 11, with little hammers to chip off all the plaster of Paris which they put on. What I discovered with Indian scaffolding is you have to arrange something two weeks in advance. So if I wanted to plaster a ceiling, I had to give them two weeks' notice because they tied all the scaffolding with bamboo. Then I would plaster the ceiling and the walls halfway down, then they would take the scaffold away and I would go into another room.

Everything was made easy. I knew what was going to happen, so I brought this special chemical, a special salt to go in the plaster. With plaster of Paris, it goes off in 10 minutes, but the same man which me and John used from Birmingham told me there's a special chemical which the Indians didn't know about. A pinch like this was enough for a bucket, and a scoop like this was enough for the big 40-gallon drum. So it would take me 20 minutes for it to go off. Shri Mataji said, "I'm giving you a plasterer. You train him up and the two of you work together."

Before I left England, she said, "In India, there's nothing. Bring everything you need." So I brought some spare English trowels. Every time Shri Mataji went away on the tour or somewhere, the Sahaj foreman would sack my plasterer. So I would go to him and say, "Why are you not working today?" He said, "No, the foreman has said I need to take half wages and I'm not doing it." So I used to come back and say to the Sahaj foreman, "Look, when Shri Mataji comes back next week and says, 'Why is this work not done?' I'm going to have to say you stopped the work. So what do you want to do about it?" And then he would say, "Okay, he can be reinstated."

That's how the work carried on. But everything I was doing, Shri Mataji made it easier. There was another Sahaja Yogi there from England, the electrician, and Shri Mataji used to give him harder and harder tasks. He didn't have a Kango, so he had to chop out the ceiling for the cables with just a hammer and a chisel. It was taking forever.

After six months, my ticket was going to be up, and then she actually said, "Oh, can you stay a bit longer?" So I said, "Fine." I changed my ticket around and I stayed a bit longer.

I've recently found a recording which I made where Shri Mataji walked around the house with the Sahaja Yogis and described all the rooms and said which room was for which daughter and stuff like that. It's audio. Also, I don't know if people know there's a book called "Nine Nights of Navaratri," which we give out as a PDF. I recorded that. The Navaratri in Pratishtan. We need to update it because when we have Navaratri, everyone misses off the tenth day when you're meant to burn Ravana, which we used to do.

I'd go back to Pratishtan '88. I think Pat had already left. Fergie was still there, Terry was still there, and there was also an Indian electrician there at that time, Mohan. I just arrived; I'd had a very, very long train ride from my family in North India. I arrived at Pratishtan, my glasses were broken, and I saw Fergie as he was heading off to Pune. I managed to find an optician to get my glasses repaired, not knowing that Shri Mataji was waiting for me.

When we came back, we got a message that Shri Mataji was angry and she wanted to see me. I remember going upstairs and she sort of blasted me and said, "If you carry on like this, then you might as well leave." I said, "No, Shri Mataji, if you want me to work, I'll work. I'm here to work." That was another very, very hard, blunt side where, when Shri Mataji got angry, it was like decisiveness inside yourself. Why are you here? Why are you a yogi? What's your purpose?

Then she got me doing the plumbing in the house. I'd never really done plumbing at that time, just helping Pat now and again in Shudy Camps. In the end, I ended up doing all the main runs up to the swimming pool on the roof.

Most nights then, Shri Mataji invited us into her apartment and we either watched movies with her... there were some very, very beautiful occasions where we had spontaneous pujas with Shri Mataji. We were allowed to offer kumkum to her feet. Other days, she would just sit there and talk to us. It was very, very much elevating. Even though we were working hard the whole day, you'd sit with Shri Mataji until one or two o'clock in the night, and then you'd be up again at six o'clock in the morning.

It was the period where my visa ran out for India. Shri Mataji was heading off north, and we'd stayed awake the whole night to see her off because she was leaving at four o'clock in the morning. We prepared some coconuts to offer to the car before she drove away, and there she asked me if I'd like to come with her to Delhi. My flight was the next day. I just remember telling her, "Shri Mataji, I'm sorry, but my visa runs out. My flight's tomorrow." That was a very special stay, indeed.

Thank you so much, everyone. I'm aware we are really running behind time. First and foremost, thanks to Shri Mataji for giving us this opportunity to remember these beautiful times. Thank you all for joining us. I'll stop recording now.
