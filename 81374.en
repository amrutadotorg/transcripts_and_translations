 (England)
Thank you so much for joining us this afternoon, probably early evening for you there in Turkey, and to share with us again your absolutely beautiful, surreal, magical moments. Would you please start with where and when those moments were?

Actually, I must confess, Shri Mataji always asked us to write a diary. I did in bits and pieces, but over the years, I don't know where those diaries are. So many people have been asking me to write down my experiences. I've started collecting; they're a bit random, so bear with me a little bit.

The first one I've got is in Brighton, where I got my realization. It’s difficult to put an exact date; it'll be '81 or '82 maybe. She had one of these little terrace houses, and they have just little gardens, so it's quite a small garden with two gardens on either side. We had a puja in this little garden. One thing I remember is that I brought some sweet peas from my father's garden. Just to show you how homemade and very casual it was—not so much spontaneous, but it was very casual in the sense that my father used to grow a lot of flowers, and I cut some sweet peas and just brought them along. We used them to decorate Shri Mataji's feet, and there's a lovely puja picture with her feet decorated with these sweet peas.

I remember being in front of Shri Mataji, and it was Rustam trying to get me to say some mantras in Sanskrit. He was kind of our puja guru in a sense because he knew what to do; we had no idea. He was telling me these long mantras to say in Sanskrit, and I had no idea what to say. Of course, it was a bit embarrassing because there we were in front of Shri Mataji. So, that's one of my earliest memories of being in front of Shri Mataji.

Which puja and which year is this, please?

As I said, I'll have to check, but it was probably '81 or '82. There wasn't a name for the pujas in those days; we just had a little puja. It was very informal, not formal at all. There wasn't a particular name.

There's another puja I remember—the first time we did Guru Dakshina. Shri Mataji just said in this puja, again I wish I could remember which puja it was, it might have been in London somewhere, but I remember very clearly that Shri Mataji said that it is auspicious to give just a little something to the Guru. And she said, "I don't want any notes. I don't even want any silver coins, just some brass coins—just the lowest money you have, brass coins." I'm sure it was because the English had no idea of offering to the Devi or offering to the Guru. I think it was a Guru Puja because it was Guru Dakshina. That memory has just come to me now, so that will have to be confirmed. But it was the very first time that Shri Mataji ever asked us to contribute in some way. I just remember the bowl went 'round, and it was just full of brass coins. That was the start of that.

Then there was another occasion in Nightingale Lane, again a Guru Puja. Somehow, I was helping to prepare the puja, and Shri Mataji was coming, but we weren't ready. She came anyway because I suppose it was an auspicious time and she just wanted to start, and we were kind of just half-ready. Just to show how informal things were in those days. Even in Cabella, she once said the reason she came late very often was because she was waiting for us to be ready. We should be ready long before, in meditation, waiting for her. But because we were often late or people were arriving late, she couldn't come before we were there. So that was the reason, apart from auspicious timing.

How much time did you have? What was it like? Did Shri Mataji phone from her home and say she's coming, and then you had hours? Relive the moment for us.

She was there in Nightingale Lane. To give another example—I wasn't even there—but the first time in Rome, Shri Mataji was sitting in the living room and just said, "Let's have a little puja." They had nothing. So they just brought a plastic salad bowl and they washed her hands, and that was a little puja. It was quite normal in those days.

Later, she started saying, "Yes, like in India, it would be considered extremely late," but at the beginning, the importance was not on the protocol; the importance was on the vibrations—just to give us vibrations or to give vibrations to the place. So that was much more important, and she knew we didn't have puja equipment. At the beginning, we just didn't. Like the first puja, you must have seen that picture—I think the very first time, we had a few irises stuck between her feet and a little box of strawberries. It was like that.

I remember that's another memory I have of Brighton. We didn't have any fruit. We didn't have time to go and buy it. I think we must have forgotten to buy the fruit, or one person thought another person was going to buy it. Anyway, we didn't have any fruit. I was going to make some chicken with pineapple for lunch, so I just brought the pineapple—luckily I hadn't cut it—and we offered that as the fruit. Just to give you an idea of how informal and almost impromptu it was. Probably the deities were just closing their eyes, biting their lips. But it's how it was. It was very, very informal.

To give you another example, one of my favorite pujas was in Lyon. We were going around France from Brighton—four of us jumped in my little Mini with all our luggage and everything. We were traveling around France to all the pujas. We went to Paris with Mother and the programs there, then Chartres to the cathedral, and then Rouen and Lyon. We went to Lyon because there was a Sahaja Yogi there, and I think there must have been a program.

What I remember was that Mother was in the living room of this Sahaja Yogi, and he played for her. He could play the sitar, so he played sitar for her, and we had a puja just there and then. That was probably one of the strongest experiences I had. I just felt a flood of emotions; I could hardly keep them in. It was so powerful because the puja was with Mother. In the early days, you actually went and washed her feet. There were only 16 people in the room, I remember, just 16 people, and each of us was invited to literally wash Mother's feet. So that was a very powerful moment. This must have been '81 or '82 because they were early days in Sahaja Yoga.

The other experience like that was in Venice when Shri Mataji came. This must have been '86, I suppose, the second Venice program. I was alone with Shri Mataji, and she asked me to wash her feet. That was so, so powerful. The water started becoming cloudy. For me, it was a shock. I didn't know what was happening; I thought maybe something wrong was happening. I wanted to finish because I thought there must be something wrong. I felt very strong vibrations, but apparently, that happens sometimes. I'm not sure why it happens, but the water goes kind of milky. I don't know if you know the meaning of that.

Someone brought him some vibrated water because he was not well, and this water went milky, just like the time when I was washing the feet of Shri Mataji.

So what was the understanding then?

I don't know. We didn't know. I still don't know the meaning, but I imagine it's something like Shri Lakshmi or something auspicious, isn't it? The water changes. It's that idea of the churning of the ocean and how the nectar came out. I imagine it's something like that. I'm not sure; we have to get that confirmed by an authority on the subject.

One of the most beautiful moments I had was driving Shri Mataji to a puja. Again, in Brighton, early days, probably '82 or '83. We arranged this seminar in East Sussex. We found this beautiful place in the country and we were going to have a puja there with Shri Mataji. Paul Winter had just bought this brand new Volvo. In the early days, he was the only Sahaja Yogi with any money. He was in Brighton with me; we had a lot of real characters there—Ray Harris, him, Phil Ward, Kingsley. Lovely times.

Anyway, he was the only Sahaja Yogi with any money and probably the only one with a car at that time. He said, "Look, I can't make it. Can you drive the car?" And I said, "What? Your brand new car? I've never driven it." He said, "No, it's okay, because we've got to go and get Shri Mataji." So, here are the keys, go. The insurance wasn't such a big deal then, obviously. It was just, yeah, just go with the vibrations. Someone had to go and pick her up. So I went, and I just felt like I was driving the Goddess. It was a lovely, lovely feeling.

What did she say to you when she saw you in this brand new Volvo?

Well, she arranged everything, so she didn't really say much in situations like that. It was just a question of getting in and taking her where she had to go. We met at the station, and there were all the Italians as well. Three Italians piled in the car with her—the three ladies, maybe Ruth, Flavia, and Alessandra. I just drove there.

But the other very important thing about that puja was when we had found this song that we knew Shri Mataji liked. Do you know this one? It was the first time it had been sung to Shri Mataji, and it was very, very moving because she said, "I was just doubting myself, looking in the mirror and saying, 'Who are you?'" This song was a favorite of her father, and she was telling this beautiful story that it gave him courage. It was very meaningful to Shri Mataji at that moment to hear this. It was very, very moving.

How did your journey as a pujari begin? When and where and how, please?

Well, it seems like I did a couple of pujas already, even in Brighton, which I wasn't aware of at the time. But I suppose that started me. Officially, if you can call it that, I remember one time in Cabella—don't ask me the year, I really don't remember—we were doing pujas in Cabella. It must be the early '90s. Chris Patmore was preparing everything, and he was alone. So I asked him if he needed help, and he said, "Yes, please."

So I started like that, just helping. He was a friend of mine, again, he was living in Brighton. I think he had just married Caroline at the time. How he became a pujari, I have no idea. But in those days, again, it was very informal. It was just like, someone did it, and whoever was there did it. So I got the job.

I do remember once, Shri Mataji asked me, "Please come on stage, because I don't always understand what people are saying." I think it was just an excuse to get me on to be the pujari. It was a sweet way. I remember in that puja, I sort of stayed near Shri Mataji's side, and halfway through the puja she said, "What are you doing here?" as if to say, "You have to stay here all the time." It was a bit like that Hanuman situation, where Hanuman just asked to click his fingers in case Rama yawns.

The puja situation is that very often, every puja was different, and Shri Mataji didn't say what to do a lot of the time. You just got on with it. And if there was something... ah, sorry, I'll go back a little bit, because something people don't know is that, for example, once in this seminar in Sussex, I offered Shri Mataji a cup of tea. She said, "Don't offer me a cup of tea, just give it to me." I think I had asked her, "Would you like a cup of tea?" She said, "Don't ask me if I want a cup of tea. You just bring it. If I want it, I'll drink it."

I give that example because it was a bit like that in the pujas. We didn't wait for Mother to say what she wanted; we just kind of offered things. And if it was okay, she just went along with it. If it wasn't okay, she would say. But that was the other thing. She would invariably ask for something during the puja, and it would always be something different. And the chances were, you didn't have it. So you would either have to run somewhere and get something or improvise or do something. That was the most nerve-wracking part.

I think, as I might have explained before, the other part is that there had to be a mistake in the puja. There is invariably a mistake. I imagine, again I haven't had it confirmed, but Shri Mataji is the Adi Shakti and she's divine, and we are not. So being on stage with Shri Mataji, you can't be on the same level.

To give you a little example that happened to me, she asked for alta, because we used to decorate her feet with this liquid kumkum which we call alta. So I brought the alta, and Shri Mataji looked at me and looked at the alta and she said, "What's that?" I said, "It's the alta, Mother." She said, "No, I asked for Alga, not alta." She wanted Alga, the yogini, to come and decorate her feet, and I took the alta instead, which is the red liquid kumkum.

But then there were always problems, like the water shouldn't be too hot or too cold. The alta shouldn't be too liquid, it shouldn't be too thick. If you leave it for a while, there's a sediment at the bottom, so you have to shake it. But you have to know you have to shake it and you have to get it all out. All these little things. So if you don't know—because the second time you know, but the first time you don't—there are all these little things that could and did go wrong. It added to the fun, let's say. You had to really, really have good attention to be in the flow, to know what to do.

Sometimes, Shri Mataji would change things up. Once I remember, she just asked me to start the puja. We'd washed the feet, and I was there on stage. I can't remember what I was doing, and she asked me to start, like with the ghee, to offer the elements, the amrut. She'd never asked me to do that, and I didn't feel it was my place to do it. Sometimes you feel it's a test. Is she testing you? Does she really want you to do it, or is it just testing your ego and then she’ll say, "Huh, what do you think you're doing?"

It was a very, very fine balance of doing it but not doing it, or just being the instrument. At that point, I just remember grabbing Grégoire, the leader, and saying, "Get the leaders," because it was the leader's job at that time. Sometimes the puja would do it, but I didn't feel like it was my place. You're on a razor's edge. Do you do it and risk being caught in an ego trap, or do you back off?

Another example I can tell you: the first time I was actually drying Shri Mataji's feet. She would really like to have her feet rubbed really quite hard, and it was tiring. You had to keep going; you couldn't stop. And she would say, "Nabhi," so you would do the Nabhi, or "Vishuddhi," or "Heart," and you'd have to go to that toe or that part of the foot. I remember it was my first time, and she said, "Vishuddhi." So I started drying her ankles, and suddenly she said, "It's not you." Because I felt that she was working on me. She obviously felt my left Vishuddhi and just said, "Look, it's not you, I'm working on the universe. You're not that important."

How old were you when you got to be a pujari?

Probably mid-20s. Let's say mid-20s. It was great fun, but as I said, you were really under the spotlight. And you don't get the benefit of meditating; you get the blessings in a way, but you don't get the bliss of meditation in a puja because you're always active, working, making sure everything is alright. There's always something to do.

So what brought about your move to Venice? How did that come about?

Oh, that's a long story, but I'll keep it short. My wife wanted to go to China. We're talking about '83 or '84. Shri Mataji just said, "Are you joking? You want to end up in jail?" because that was the '80s. It was not a good time to spread Sahaja Yoga in China. Then, Shri Mataji was there with the leaders, saying, "Okay, so where do we need to have a new center?" I remember they were discussing either Bologna or Venice, and Shri Mataji wanted Venice. So then it was like, who can go to Venice?

Okay, my wife, Flavia, wanted to go somewhere, so we could go to Venice. Also, because I was a teacher, I could change my job. I applied for jobs in Venice, and so I went. We got this little flat in Venice, and we had a beautiful, beautiful program there in, I think it was the San Giovanni Battista—John the Baptist hall. It was a beautiful hall dedicated to John the Baptist. Shri Mataji stood up the whole time and just gave the talk, a very beautiful talk.

That was another beautiful moment with Shri Mataji. On the way to the program, we went in a taxi, but since it was Venice, it was a water taxi. I was a little bit concerned about Mother getting onto the boat. She said, "Don't worry, I come from a family of seamen and sailors." I suppose it's because her father, C.P. Srivastava, was in the maritime sector.

Anyway, on the way, Shri Mataji was in meditation, and suddenly she just said, "What do the people want to know?" I didn't know quite how to answer, so she said, "Like, what do they want?" It was a time when there was some problem with Libya; Libya was firing rockets at Lampedusa, which is in the south of Italy. So I just said, "Mother, they want peace."

It's really interesting because I never really realized that Mother sort of planned her talks. You always think that Mother is totally spontaneous, but it taught me a very important lesson that even the Adi Shakti planned her talks. She focused on what the people wanted. That's a very important message. She came to my mind... and it was a beautiful talk because, as you know, she says everything in the first three sentences. She bowed to the seekers of peace and she said, "The seekers of truth," and she said, "Yes, the truth is what it is, and that is that you are the Spirit." Basically, she said everything in just three sentences and then started a very, very beautiful talk. It was very interesting how she understood the feeling of the people. That's how she touches the heart, I suppose. She really understands what people need to hear.

So, anything else? Okay, I'll just tell you my favorite part. The best part of being a pujari for me was, strangely, taking off the jewelry. Because up until that point, putting everything on, there's a kind of buildup to a climax, and there's quite a lot of tension to get it all right. But then, tensions are pouring out, and everything is relaxed. When you just take off the jewelry and the toe rings and the anklets, it's just so beautiful. It's just blissful. Because it's almost like Shri Mataji is relaxing; the whole mood is harmonious and graceful. It's just a beautiful moment when you're just part of it. It made it all worthwhile, all that stress beforehand.

You started being a pujari in the early to mid-80s and continued until when was it, remind us, please?

The 2000s, yes, almost until I left for Turkey, which was 2001. That was my last time with Shri Mataji, but yes, I still help with the puja sometimes, even in Cabella or wherever.

Being a pujari for this span of time, how did things evolve or change, or not?

The main thing was the formality. At the beginning, it was very informal because Shri Mataji was so much more part of the family. It was just like a family gathering. That's making it sound too commonplace, but it was very relaxed. Then it obviously became more and more formal, and the protocol became more important. And the numbers just grew. I'm talking about doing a one-to-one puja with Shri Mataji to doing it with thousands and thousands of people in India. It's just totally different.

Of course, Shri Mataji couldn't do it the same way. Also, at the beginning, she was telling us everything. At the end, we knew what to do, so she didn't have to tell us. She could really just be Adi Shakti at the end. She could go into a different realm and she didn't like to be disturbed. You dared not disturb her, not for something trivial like, "What do we do now?" You would never ask something like that.

In fact, I remember once Shri Mataji asked me, "What should we do now?" This was in Cabella. And again, what do you say? It seemed like a trap. Because she's the Adi Shakti, who am I to say what to do? So I didn't say anything, of course. Every puja was different, and she was deliberately doing something different every time. So there is a kind of flexibility sometimes, but I just did not feel it was for me to say what to do.

Shri Mataji used to give a lot of gifts on her visits and also receive a lot of presents from the hosting countries. Do you have any memories from those moments being on stage with Shri Mataji?

So many moments. She used to really appreciate meaningful presents. Sometimes she was very happy, and sometimes she wasn't happy at all. It varied tremendously, even though she may not have expressed it on stage. She liked it when it was something auspicious. But she didn't often say it in public. Very often, it was afterwards, in the castle in Cabella, she would then look at all the presents again and decide what to do with them. She would then maybe make friends and appreciate it and take a good look at it. Whereas in the puja, there were so many, she would just take them, and they would be passed or just put aside and then taken to the castle. Very rarely would she comment there and then, also because it wasn't the place. It was a very sacred moment, a very deep moment after the puja. The vibrations, everyone's meditating while the presents were being offered.

And all these presents that have been offered to Shri Mataji are inventoried, and most of them are on display in Cabella, is that right?

Not on display. Again, another memory of Shri Mataji was when she said, "What am I going to do with all these things?" That's when she said, "Stop giving me presents." But then, of course, the leaders said, "No, we have to give you," because it's protocol and this and that. I remember once in India she asked me, "What can I do? We have to find some solution." She said, "I have to keep buying houses to put all these presents." That's why she had so many houses—because she had all these things, she had to put them somewhere.

I remember, again probably not auspiciously, I said the only thing I could think of was, "What if we gave donations to a project or something that is auspicious that needs donations?" But she just fell silent, and I felt, no, that's not really what you do at a puja. The donation should come, and that's another story.

I was alone with Shri Mataji in Cabella this time. I used to be there quite often because I would be responsible for taking all the donations, all the money from the pujas, and taking it to the bank. I would go and pay my respects, and Shri Mataji would often talk about it. She was very annoyed when people asked for a discount, for example. There was a period when pujas were actually quite expensive, and she said, "You don't pay for a puja. It's a donation." But she said, "If I didn't make a price, do you know how many people would give donations?"

Even for us being in Italy, it was very difficult. Sometimes I had to say, "I'm afraid I can't come to the puja," because I couldn't afford to go to every puja. And she said, "You don't have to pay." So it was a kind of awkward moment. Of course we pay, and then you get the blessings for paying, but sometimes, with a family, it was just not possible to go to every puja. So there were these moments when she was very upset that people didn't understand the principle of giving and donations and finding the balance.

Did she advise you about it?

The only thing concerning that subject is that there was a big meeting once with the leaders about how we were going to raise money for, I can't remember what the project was. I remember in the early days for Shudy Camps, she said every Sahaja Yogi has to donate £1,000. And £1,000 in England in '81-'82 was enormous. Still a big amount, but then it must have been huge.

But in this case, with the leaders, everyone came up with their ideas. This was the nice thing: one person suggesting this, another person suggesting that. And Mother just in the end said, "In the end, I'm my Lakshmi. If it's right, the money will come. You don't have to worry about the money." This she did very often in her leaders' meetings and in the "Brains Trust" and all these sorts of things. She would hear everybody's point of view.

What's the Brains Trust?

Oh, that was in the early days in England. She would get some of the leaders, the knowledgeable leaders, to form a panel, and then we would ask them questions. Or even she would ask questions. She would say, "So what's special about Sahaja Yoga?" and each of the panel would have to say what was special about Sahaja Yoga, for example. Something like that, like a quiz program. Was she playing with their egos? Or was it to impart knowledge? I think it was all of it, because she never did one thing at a time. She was working on so many levels: partly playing with the ego, partly imparting knowledge, and partly seeing if they had the knowledge.

Just the other day, I was listening to a talk when Mother was saying how you have to be knowledgeable in Sahaja Yoga. You have to know. She said she was in Australia and she was shocked because some people didn't know—she said, "Work on the void on the feet," and they didn't know where the void was on the feet. She said, "How can you not know? You have to know." Not only do you have to know because I'm asking you, but you have to know to impress people. They have to be impressed by your knowledge. And one thing I remember she said in England, "You come into Sahaja Yoga and then you kind of relax and you think..." She says, "The real seeking starts in Sahaja Yoga." It's not like you've arrived. Before, we were seeking in the dark, but now we have the knowledge. We know what we should be looking for. We have all the knowledge available, why aren't we just imbibing it? I think that was what the message was. All the knowledge is there, I'm giving you all the pure knowledge, you just have to take it in. And still, after 40-odd years, I'm still learning.

Well, the journey continues, isn't it? We've come home when we got our realization, and now the journey for evolution and spiritual life continues.

Absolutely. It's really... there's that beautiful dimension, like the deeper you go, the more you see there is to know. It's just infinite.

Did you have one of those moments with Shri Mataji where she sort of showed you... I mean, I've had illuminations and revelations and stuff like that. Any you would like to share?

Well, one I'm very proud of, if that doesn't sound too arrogant. I always had this feeling that the Shiva Lingam was not Shiva; it was the female Shiva. It was more like the uterus with the egg. It doesn't look like anything male; it's much more female. But I never told anyone this theory. I only sent it because it's very delicate, very intimate, very embarrassing, and I didn't want to be wrong. But then in the last book of Shri Mataji, she mentions it, that it is actually the Shakti. And the pure—you see, that's it. We always think the creator is Brahma, but in actual fact, it's the Shakti, it's the woman who creates. And we are in God's image, and that is exactly it. Not only is it the woman who creates, it is the immaculate conception. It's without Shiva.

And that's why she was so, let's say, insisting that we were her children, pure. We were pure like Ganesha because she created us. There was no male side; it was just she is our Mother and that's it. We are pure like Ganesha. The Kundalini gives us realization, and it's pure. So then I was very pleased to see she said that.

Shri Mataji had a great sense of humor. When you were attending to her, whether it was in Cabella or in England, is there any incident you'd like to share with us?

So many, so many. I think the most beautiful memory I have... She would imitate leaders, political figures, but also leaders in Sahaja Yoga, and it would be so funny. But the most beautiful, pure humor... because we as English have to be very careful. We have this terrible humor that Shri Mataji did not approve of—this sarcasm and irony. It's really not humor.

The most beautiful memory I have with Shri Mataji is in Cheltenham Road. I don't know if it was the first marriages, but anyway, there were marriages. I'm afraid I can't remember who was getting married, but it was the Haldi ceremony. We didn't know what a Haldi ceremony was. Shri Mataji was showing us; she was there making the Haldi and passing it out and saying we have to put it on people. Of course, this ended up in a kind of mud fight, and Shri Mataji was in the middle of it, and she was roaring with laughter. She was having so much fun. And the more she was laughing, the more fun we had. She was laughing so much she could hardly breathe. She was really, genuinely laughing, enjoying our fun. It was just so lovely.

There were moments like that when she would just enjoy our company, and we would enjoy hers. It was just a reflection. Beautiful, beautiful times.

Unparalleled and incredible. Thank you, thank you so much for taking your time and sharing your absolutely golden memories with Shri Mataji, all the way from Turkey. Thank you so much for joining us today.
