 (England)
Thank you so much for joining us this evening for you and afternoon for us in England. Thank you so much for joining us this afternoon. The picture is not quite complete without both of you being there together, so I really appreciate you joining us.

Where we should begin today, perhaps, is that journey that Sanjay Talwaji had explained: the first meeting with Shri Mataji way back in the '80s when his younger sister was getting ready to meet the bridegroom's party, who came with Shri Mataji and her Sahaja Yogis to your house. The younger daughter-in-law in a North Indian household is in a very, very precarious position. And it's something like a VIP visiting. Could we have, from your perspective, what it was like? You were busy preparing, of course, getting your sister-in-law ready and probably preparing food and things to take care of the very special guests. What was your impression of the whole party? And what was your journey with Shri Mataji like? Could you please take us from that point?

Yes, yes. I'm happy to join you for this sharing of experiences. That day was really very special because we are very close to Meenakshi, my sister-in-law. We were very happy for her because after a few proposals went downhill, this one really looked like they were matched for each other. And the families were also very joyfully coming together, though from totally different cultures—Punjabis and Maharashtrians. The food, even the language and the pehnawa (the way you dress), the whole thing was different. That was a different experience for us altogether because we were more the chapati, roti, paratha type, and they were totally rice. So for us, that in itself was a very big change.

Of course, for this lunch where the families were going to meet for the first time, everything was arranged. We were a joint family, so every function had a lot of effort from each member. They had a special place and a special sort of responsibility. We knew that the Buaji (aunt) was coming with the father-in-law, mother-in-law, and the mama and the bua, who are Baba Mama for us now.

Sanjayji has explained very well how everybody was sitting on the floor. I was a bit in awe of the whole situation because the first glimpse of Shri Mataji was breathtaking. It was very different. Even though at that moment, we were just introduced to her as the aunt, as the bua, her whole ambience was very godly. Initially, without knowing anything about her, because we were not prepared—there was no background given to us—that was the first impression we got. After that, when we were serving the food, she was a very, very small eater compared to the rest of the family. She just stopped at one chapati and a little bit of rice. I kept trying to offer her more. I said, "I hope you like the food." And she said, "Of course, it's very, very delicious, the Punjabi khana. I love this food," but that was all. She wouldn't take more.

A few months later, my son was born in September 1985. Shri Mataji had also come to our house then, and we have photographs in which she's holding him in her lap. I thought there couldn't be a bigger blessing for him than having Shri Mataji hold him in her lap and caress him.

I want to fast forward a little bit to the years from 1986 onwards. In '87, Sanjayji was traveling with Shri Mataji to the programs. He was very involved with the music team that was being set up by Shri Mataji and was going overseas. That was the time I was working with my father-in-law in the nursing home. I had a full-time responsibility with the children, the family, and my parents were also in Delhi. I don't know how those years went between '86 and '91, when the nursing home closed down. Sanjayji was not really around for the family. He was just always either planning, physically away, or recording music.

When the cassettes were being made, the whole family became like an assembly line. We were putting the cassette covers on, putting the cassettes in the boxes, then making smaller boxes out of them, and writing the information on them. Everybody was on the job. Whether it was the bearer or the cook, whoever he could grab hold of, they were sitting in the assembly line. Of course, the children, my bhabhi, my mother-in-law, father-in-law—everybody, after dinner, we would sit down and put these tapes into covers and then quickly into boxes. They had to be labeled and then put away in preparation for Ganapathi Pule or for going to Europe. Suitcases were brought out, and we were told, "This is not coming back. You will have to get them into a box in which it will have to be gifted with the suitcase." That was perfectly okay with the family. They said, "Okay, no problem. Just have them ready in time."

That was a time that... what can I say? I was very involved in heading the responsibility of the family. For some time I did feel his absence also, because of the children—for birthdays, parent-teacher meetings, and milestones that children remember, even holidays. He was mostly away. But the thing was that because Shri Mataji was the focal point, it went very smoothly. I never felt that anything was amiss. It was all, in its own way, getting completed, and everything was getting looked after. That was a miracle by itself.

Once or twice, Shri Mataji even came to stay with us. There was some public program, and in between, she had to rest, so I was looking after her. This was '87, maybe '88. There were programs in West Delhi and some medical conferences happening. In between those programs, it was too far to go to Vasant Vihar where Shri Mataji was staying, so she would come to our house. We had, of course, the master bedroom prepared for her—my parents-in-law's bedroom. One minute I felt that she was in a very deep sleep after the meal, but luckily, I was just there. I didn't go anywhere. Within a couple of minutes, she was up, getting ready for the other program, and already dressed. It was always a very big and very fast transformation.

I remember these starched cotton sarees with the borders. It would take us a very long time to put those pleats together, and the starch in the saree doesn't allow you that fall. But she was just amazing, totally awesome. The way she would switch from a lying down, deep sleep position into sitting in front of the dressing table, already ready to go. She would just walk out and say, "Come."

One thing that I noticed in every city, because we did travel with her a lot, was that when we went to a city, the people were very fresh and ready to walk with her, go that extra mile, do everything. Then when we were going to the next city, when I look back, they were already falling over because the vibrations were so much for them. But she was fresh like a flower. She was going from Jaipur to another city, to Bombay, then coming back to Delhi, then going to Lucknow. It told you of the kind of energy she had. There was no question of getting tired. She was always in a fresh avatar.

Interviewer: Tell us something about your private life... I wanted to know, what was the turning point? What was that moment when you realized that it wasn't just any special VIP relative, but that it is the divine? For our viewers, Bua, as you said, is the father's sister. When did you realize this?

I think it was in Ganapathi Pule, at a puja. That experience that you have is like no other. You cannot even explain it. At that time, when I spoke to my friends about it, I wanted to compare it to something like childbirth. The pain and everything is there, and you feel, "My goodness, it's the first time. I can't do this. It's just not going to happen." And then you just surrender. And when it happens, you cannot explain it. It just happened.

For me, it was the first Ganapathi Pule in 1986. When I saw her there, it was a cutoff from the daily toil. There were no cell phones at that time, so when we were there, we were just focused and with her, listening to her. It was then that I felt that there is definitely something more than what you can see. It can take a long time for it to sink in because we came with a lot of baggage, a lot of pre-formed notions and experiences. Being Arya Samajis, we were also into Havans and stuff like that. And I come from a school with moral science and subjects like that, and the whole background about the Ramayana, Mahabharata. By 20 years old, you have read a lot and you're exposed to a lot of things, but this was something different. That's when I felt it.

And I remember later, in 1999, I was undergoing a medical condition. I had an injury on my leg, and very fortunately for me, the growth of the cells was outward; it wasn't going towards the bone, so they could easily operate. It was a malignancy. For that, we were advised to go to New York for advanced chemotherapy. On that trip, we met Shri Mataji. She was coming to New York from India, and we went to meet her at the airport. She already knew about it because Sanjay had been following the three-candle treatment she had advised. After that, I went for the chemotherapy and radiotherapy just to rule out any possibility of anything spreading.

Shri Mataji met us and very lovingly, she told me that there is nothing to worry. "I have been cleared already. I have taken care of it." That was itself a very big miracle in our lives because we were still very young with young children and many responsibilities. I was 41 years old. That was a very big turning point in our life. I had checkups after that; every five years, I was supposed to go for scans. But by her grace, after 10, 15 years, everything was cleared. I was given the green signal, and it had gone completely. That was a very big blessing from Shri Mataji.

Sanjay: I remember a couple of things that she told me when Shri Mataji was in Delhi. She used to come and stay in Rajesh Shah's guest house in Vasant Vihar. This was in 1989, '90. I remember she asked for my wife to look after her, and Ratna was staying with her overnight. A couple of things happened. Do you remember those experiences about the news of Mr. Dhumal?

Yes. There was this news about the Sahaja Yogi, Mr. Dhumal. He had just passed away, and Shri Mataji got the news while I was with her. It was the only time, in fact, that I saw that she was actually sobbing. There was a big sense of loss because it's like a plant which you have cultured, grown, and put so much of your love into, and suddenly it's taken away. She said she had already warned him, but he didn't listen to her, and so this was to happen. It took a little bit of time, a couple of hours in fact, that she was sitting up. I wouldn't say she was in grief, because I felt she already knew. But that was part of her maya, that she was a human being in that moment. She was very normal, like when somebody passes away and you have those emotions, your heart breaking down. She felt a helplessness, which she was very vocal about. But there was nobody else in the room. It was just that she felt that had this not happened... we had a gem. We had a real gem in Sahaja Yoga, which we have lost now.

At many instances, you felt that she's just one of us. Her humaneness was so apparent, but only in glimpses. Suddenly, she was looking, but she would look through you. She was not actually looking at you; she's looking into your eyes, but she's looking through you because she's not there. At that moment, I was very full up about it because we didn't know Mr. Dhumal so well. He was very senior, but we had heard about him.

Sanjay: Tell her about that motherly touch she gave when we went to her house.

We were in Juhu. We had taken the children; I think our daughter was about eight years old and our son was five. They were playing in the room while she was talking to us about the music and the next music tour. Then she just looked at the children and said, "Oh, you're playing here?" Then she opened her purse and gave them a hundred rupees each. And she said, "Now you go to the beach and you enjoy yourself. Go and have some ice cream and some coconut water." This was probably 1990.

Sanjay: Yes. I had just written a song for an album and said, "I have to go and meet Shri Mataji to show her the song." That was when Yogi Mahajan was there. He had to go out somewhere and said, "You better be with Shri Mataji because I am the only one looking after her." When he stepped out, he gave us the responsibility. It was exact lunchtime when we had gone there with the children. When we were there, she came to the table and we all had lunch together.

After lunch, she normally goes to sleep, so we were a little hesitant. We felt she was now going to go and take some rest, but no, she called us. She said, "You come in my bedroom." We went in, and she asked the children to go lie down on a divan next to her bed. She laid down herself and asked the children to lie down.

Aradhana: We were sitting and talking to her. I think the children went to sleep. This is again like a very human thing. She's a grandmother. She just told the children to go and play. These instances were very... suddenly you lose that whole perspective of who she is. You come so close to her and you actually start feeling that she's a family member. Only in the next instance to know that she's something really beyond our perception.

Sanjay: That day, it was her rest time. When she went to lie down, we felt awed and thought we should leave the room. But she said, "No, you stay on." When the children went to sleep, she also lay down. I planned that I'll leave the room, but she said, "No, you sit here." She made me sit next to her on the floor, closer to her forehead. Then she asked me to put my agnya finger onto her bindi. I put it there. She said, "You also lie down on the floor." So while I lay down on the floor, my hand was up on the bed, my agnya finger on her forehead. And she started to snore. She went to sleep.

I thought I would remove my finger so it didn't disturb her, but she just quickly said, "Put it back." She wouldn't let me take it away. I moved the other way around and put my other agnya finger. She said, "Put the other one also." It was like she was clearing me. My agnya finger was on her forehead for a long time. My arms were getting very tired, and after some time, I must have withdrawn my hands. And I passed out. I completely passed out. It was a very deep sleep.

When I woke up, the bedroom was opening onto the beach. It was right on Juhu beach; her doors would open and you could just walk onto the sand from there. I saw there was so much light in the room. Shri Mataji was not on her bed. The children were not there. Aradhana was not there. I just thought, "What has happened? Where have they all gone?" I got up and looked around, and then I saw this beautiful scene. The children were running on the water, and Aradhana and Shri Mataji were sitting down having tea. I don't know how long they must have been together. I must have missed all the fun. But I do remember, I passed out.

Aradhana: It was like you were with family. The children felt so easy, so happy. Shri Mataji was doing everything to look like a grandmom and to me, like a real mother. She was just so, so loving to us. We felt that we could be living there for ages with Shri Mataji.

Sanjay: And that was the time when I had read out my poem to her on the dining table when we were having lunch. Then Yogi came back and he said, "Wow, you guys have been there for hours. I thought you would have gone back after lunch." I said, "No. Shri Mataji called us into her room, we had an afternoon nap, and now we are having evening tea." How lucky is that?

Aradhana: There is one more incident. It could have been the early '90s, late 1991. We were traveling by train from Lucknow to Delhi and we alighted together. I was with Shri Mataji in her compartment. We alighted at the New Delhi railway station. Shri Mataji used to walk quite comfortably fast; if you don't keep up pace with her, you're left behind. Somehow in those days, the stations were not that crowded. We were just going towards the exit.

At that time, Sanjay was expressing a desire to go to Bombay to try out singing as a profession. His professional career in chemical technology hadn't really taken off after he joined his father in the nursing home. He met Shri Mataji, and that was also a thing of the past. So now he wanted to try out this singing in Bombay. He had told me he was going to try this, and I happened to mention it to Shri Mataji. "He's going to try this in Bombay, Shri Mataji. He wants to go for playback singing." She just looked at me, her full face, and she said, "No. He must not go. He must stay and do his music and his poetry and follow this in Sahaja Yoga only." And that was it. There was no more discussion.

This was a very big decree from her, but put very gently and very firmly. So I told him in the evening when we went home, "This is what she said." And I think there was no further discussion on it.

Sanjay: No, there wasn't. On the sidelines, I had got a call from Salil Chaudhary, a very famous music director in Bollywood. For the film Anand... those songs are classics. In the Delhi ashram, there was this gentleman from Calcutta, a Bengali. He used to get after me, "Sanjay, you've been singing so many bhajans for Shri Mataji. Your voice is so good. Why don't you go and sing for Bollywood? My own brother-in-law's name is Salil Chaudhary. I will talk to him." So I was excited. I said, "Wow, what a chance."

Then this happened when she asked Shri Mataji about it. But a year or two later, when this matter was over, I was in Bombay. I got a bit interested, thinking, "At least let me pass an audition. I may not go and do it, but why don't I just quietly get an audition done?" So I sent a message to the gentleman to talk to his brother-in-law. I spoke to Salil Chaudhary on the phone, and he said, "You come tomorrow." But the next day never came.

That next day, when I made a call to find out where he is and what time I should be there, the person on the other side said, "Sir, he passed away the night before."

Interviewer: So Shri Mataji told you, "No Bollywood singing, stick to Sahaj singing." One can understand the allure and attraction to at least give it a go.

Sanjay: Exactly. I wanted to pass his audition. And Shri Mataji knew everything. After that, I didn't dare even look that side. Not even think beyond what her words implied. It was just on that railway station, coming from Lucknow to the Delhi railway station. That was it.

But she got very excited when the music I was composing and singing was appreciated in Ganapathi Pule and the cassettes were going everywhere. Shri Mataji was very, very involved. It was giving her so much joy about my developing into a singer, composer, writer, and a filmmaker now.

Shri Mataji in a couple of instances told me, "You can go and sing in Doordarshan or on the radio." And suddenly, I got letters and invitations to perform on television and radio. I got a call from All India Radio, and I was singing bhajans there. I was so excited. I told Shri Mataji that All India Radio was going to be playing my bhajans. I remember there was this gentleman who used to drive Shri Mataji's car, Rajesh Shah's driver. He used to tell me, "You're very lucky." He said if Shri Mataji would come into the car, she would say, "Bring Sanjay's cassette." So, if she would drive anywhere within Delhi, my bhajans would play in the car. There was a time when he forgot to put my cassette in, and she said, "No, I'll sit. Go get the cassette. Otherwise, this journey will not start."

When that call from All India Radio came, I made sure I sang Sahaj bhajans. Half an hour before the program, I made a call to the number I had for where she was staying. She happened to be at the Kutub Institutional Area. Shri Mataji stopped everything she was doing. She sat down, asked for the radio to be turned on to that particular station, and waited for the program to start. She heard the whole program. After she heard it, she asked them to dial my number. I had this feeling she might want to talk to me. And she did. She said, "I am so happy. I bless you. Wonderful job. And you just see how many places you will go and how much recognition you will get."

That desire of mine, of the Bombay thing, was actually maturing in another form, where I was continuing to do bhajans, but they were going into the electronic media. The next year, I think 1992, I got a call from Doordarshan. They invited me to perform three of my own compositions, which I had made for Shri Mataji. It was a half-an-hour Doordarshan presentation on my bhajans, and it came live on TV. For us to be live on TV, on a prime time of Doordarshan, was quite an achievement. What more could I have asked for? She had already fulfilled that desire of mine.

Sanjay: In 2002, when I had made Jai Jagadambe Ma, my latest presentation, something similar happened. I went to her, and she said, "I think you should go international with your music. You should not just limit yourself to making bhajans; you should make audio-visuals for the big screen." So we took a cue from that. I made a video, shot in the mountains, hired dancers and a music director. That's where my first exposure to filmmaking started. That particular album was called Jai Jagadambe Ma, and in the video format, it was called Ma Ka Ashirwad, which was presented to her on her birthday puja in Balewadi in 2003. When I sent it to Shri Mataji, she said, "Bring all the VCDs and distribute them to Sahaja Yogis." I had a stall there with a small TV playing the video. She had fixed the price, and it was selling like hotcakes. She said, "Go to Times of India, they will take your music." The next day, I went, and very easily, they signed up a 10-year contract with me. The albums were on their website, all over the world.

Similarly, something happened the same year with ghazals. She said, "Ghazals are all left-sided, they are all negative, people cry. You should go research a bit." So I researched and found some beautiful words in some ghazals which have never been set to music. Great writers like Jaan Nisar Akhtar, Ali Sardar Jafri, Majrooh Sultanpuri, Jigar Moradabadi—I researched which ones are positive, which have a Sahaj connotation. Then I composed music on those. Mother had already taught me how to do a recording when I was doing Ruhani Roshni.

Interviewer: Please tell us about these photos you have.

Sanjay: This is one taken at Pratishthan. I had gone to take her blessings before a recording. I think this is before the recording of the cassette Bandagi for Shri Mataji. She had her feet on my back, and somebody clicked this photograph. This was my co-singer for Bandagi, and Shri Mataji is working on her, again in Pratishthan. This is 1988. Then there's this very famous playback singer singing in that cassette Bandagi with us. This is a photograph of the cassette Bandagi in Pratishthan with Baba Mama and the entire team.

The song I sang in Bandagi was written by Baba Mama. And it was the same year I recorded Ruhani Roshni. It goes like this: "Ruhani roshni... ruhani roshni..."

Interviewer: It's amazing how Shri Mataji transforms people. Baba Mama was an accountant, and then he was writing poetry. You were a chemical engineer, and then you were singing and making Sahaj films.

Sanjay: It took a while for Baba Mama to discover my vibrations. In the early stages, when he came to know about the recording of Ruhani Roshni, he told me, "How come you've done all this so fast and I have not known much about you? I would also like to do an album." Shri Mataji had called Nirmal Sangeet Sarita to accompany me on our foreign tours where she herself distributed Ruhani Roshni. He was watching with awe. The minute he got back, the first thing he did was book a studio and say, "I'm going to do an album called Bandagi." Shri Mataji told him, "Don't record this album without Sanjay."

He had zero experience with me. He was going after that great musician to sing the male part of the song. So the musician came to the studio and recorded his voice. Then Baba Mama went to Shri Mataji and said, "Mother, I've recorded this song." She had asked me to be there, so I was in the studio, but he never recorded me. He recorded this man and told her, "He's a very popular singer. Because of his popularity, this cassette will probably reach out to many people." Shri Mataji just listened but said, "But I wanted Sanjay to sing."

He played the song that the musician sang. Then Shri Mataji asked me, "Sanjay, you sing the same song." So I sang the same song in front of her. She asked Baba Mama, "Do you feel the vibrations?" Baba Mama said, "Yes, Mother, his voice is very vibratory. His voice is shaking. He is nowhere close to this musician." Shri Mataji said, "I'm talking of Sahaj vibrations, not the vibrations in the voice. Can you feel it on your palms?" He said, "Jee, Shri Mataji, it's very cool." Then she said, "Well, now you play this man's song and now you feel the vibrations." He did the same and had to be honest and say, "No, Mother, it's not that cool as it was coming with Sanjay." So she said, "Now go back to the studio and record Sanjay on the same track."

The biggest compliment I got was after I finished my recording. This great musician came up to me and said, "Sanjay bhai, the heart and feel with which you sang, I was not a patch on that. I am telling Baba to take your song and not to take my song." He was a wonderful person. That is when he convinced Baba Mama that my song should be on the first part of the album. Shri Mataji's idea of music was that Sahaja Yogis who are practicing Sahaja Yoga should perform and record, not professional singers from Bollywood.

Sanjay: When I was in Cabella attending a puja, there was this discussion going on that Shri Mataji had to leave for the USA and Canada. They were talking about who was going to go with Shri Mataji, and it seemed that nobody was ready at that moment. I just happened to be sitting there. My passport used to have visas for the major countries. I had no plans to travel, but the desire came in my mind, "Mother, why can't I come with you?" Immediately it caught her attention, and she said, "There you are, Sanjay can come with me."

That was one of the most beautiful experiences I had, traveling with her from Cabella to the US and Canada. I remember I traveled once with her to LA. There wasn't much music in America. We suddenly landed at this public program where Mother had to speak. Before that, there had to be some bhajans. But I saw no stage set up, no musicians, nothing. I was getting a little panicky. They said, "Shri Mataji has hardly been here."

So I sat in the front row, hoping I would get an opportunity to sing. As I was contemplating, Shri Mataji walked in and asked, "Were there any bhajans?" Everybody cut a blank figure. Then she suddenly looked down at me in the front row as if saying, "What are you doing sitting there? Come on the stage and sing bhajans." I immediately got the prompt. I took the stage, asked for a mic, and there were no musicians with me. The minute I came to the mic, I don't know what came over me. I just announced, "Anybody in this crowd who knows how to play an instrument and has an instrument with them, please come forward and accompany me."

And lo and behold, we found somebody with a tabla, somebody with a guitar. Two or three people just walked up as if Hanuman had created the musicians from within the audience. They sat next to me, and I just started singing. They had never played with me, I had never known them, but they were playing so beautifully as if we had practiced. Look at this miracle that Shri Mataji created on the stage to have a bhajan group out of nowhere. We had an amazing public program that evening in LA. I will never forget this. Shri Mataji spoke so beautifully after that. She used to always tell me, "If you sing bhajans before my program, it prepares the people much better to take their self-realization. It helps me."

Sanjay: I met all these great musicians of America: Stephen Day, Matt Malley. In Britain, we had Tim Bruce and Harry, who came out with a cassette called The Golden Goddess. In 1989, I went to the UK and heard them perform before Shri Mataji. She asked me to meet them, saying, "Here are these musicians born here, like you are in India. You all should collaborate." It was so much fun with the West meets the East. We used to improvise and play in the public programs.

Interviewer: Tell us the warnings, the words of wisdom that Shri Mataji told you directly, that musicians in Sahaj should remember.

Sanjay: With musicians, she used to note that they always want claps and recognition, and it's a never-ending process. With most singers who don't practice Sahaj Yoga, they always demand a price. Shri Mataji used to respect that because she said they deserve it; they have that innate divinity in them. She used to always appreciate that and always pay them heftily.

In 1994 or '95, she put me in charge of the stage for her birthday puja. Shri Mataji wanted to prepare me for the role of Master of Ceremonies. One of those years, Shri Mataji paid a visit to the Dargah in Nizamuddin. There were these Qawwals singing there, the Nizami Qawwals. She was very impressed and invited them to the three-day performances for her birthday. There was a big team contacting great artists like M. Rajam, Anup Jalota, Ghulam Mustafa Khan, and Shobhana Narayan.

Shri Mataji called Baba Mama and me and said, "I want Sanjay to get experience as an MC. I want him to take over for my birthday puja." So Baba Mama stayed behind the stage and put me in front. The whole organization was on my shoulders. My duty was to get in touch with them, understand their needs, arrange hotels, cars, practice sessions, and meals. Shri Mataji was consulted every day. I would give her a list, and she would say, "Keep this person first, this person second."

I remember these Qawwals from Nizamuddin. I had to find out how much money they were going to charge. They were asking for some 11,000 rupees, which was a huge amount those days. After they performed, people were dancing and putting money on the chadar they had. They must have collected a fortune. Other than that, they had made their demand. I had a bag with all the money to hand over to the musicians. Do you know how much Shri Mataji put in that envelope for them? 51,000. When they saw the money, they fell on my feet. I said, "Please don't fall on my feet. Please go to Shri Mataji. She is the giver." Until today, one of them calls me his maker. After that, the Nizamuddin Qawwals never saw a bad day in their life.

Sanjay: She gave me one more opportunity in Russia when the coup happened. It could be 1991 or '93. Shri Mataji was supposed to travel to Tolyatti for a public program in a stadium with 35,000 or 40,000 people. The coup happened a day before. The airspace was shut, and Shri Mataji was supposed to fly from Cabella with Baba Mama. We musicians were dispatched by bus. Shri Mataji sent us to Tolyatti a day earlier to prepare for the music. She said, "You people perform until I arrive."

When we reached Tolyatti, we were told the airspace was shut and Shri Mataji was not coming. I kept getting messages from Cabella that Shri Mataji said, "Since I can't come, and Baba Mama is not there to be the MC, Sanjay, there's no other option but for you to take over." So that is how, for the first time, I took over managing a crowd of 35,000 people. We decided we were going to give them realization through our music. We started performing at seven in the evening, and we finished at four in the morning. Somewhere around one o'clock, I announced that because of the closure of the airspace, Shri Mataji was not able to come, but they could have their self-realization while we were singing. Photographs have come where the vibrations are flowing out of people's heads. All of them in the stadium got their self-realization. Shri Mataji said, "I'm so happy. My children have done what I wanted." The whole drama was played by the Devi.

When she came to know I managed the stage, that is the time she told Baba Mama, "I want him now to look after my birthday puja in Delhi." That's how I got that opportunity.

Interviewer: When does the transition come from music to big-screen filmmaking?

Sanjay: This one major event happened on the 10th of December 2002. I was telling you about my album Jai Jagadambe Ma and she said, "You could make an audio-visual." Then she said, "That's good what you've done. But I meant cinema." She told me this at the Balewadi Puja. After that, there was no going back. I didn't know anything about filmmaking. I was zero, just like I didn't know anything about writing poetry or composing music.

She said, "There are a lot of people who will not appreciate your work because we have more people who are gossipers and rumor-mongers. Don't be afraid. I'm with you." I said, "Shri Mataji, but I don't know how to make a film." And Shri Mataji said, "But you are not making it. I have made it already. It's already done. Just go push the door and see everything is done." She gave so many bandhans, closed her eyes, and then said, "Your work is done. Just try, do it, and see how it will work out."

I asked her, "Shri Mataji, how will it happen? And when will it happen?" She said, "You nurture the desire and it will work out." I just followed her words verbatim. I took the first step, formed an NGO, and floated the message. Many people came to support it. I found a writer, and we narrowed it down to a film called Gaya Lakshmi. Then I bumped into a very big institution that teaches filmmaking, and one of their heads turned out to be a Sahaja Yogi. Every moment was like opening a door was a miracle. Gaya Lakshmi was made and got one award.

Then the pandemic came, so we started writing Mahalakshmi Path. It was graduating from Gaya Lakshmi to the central channel. Now you see, 114 awards in one and a half years. It has been nominated for five awards at the Toronto Film Festival. Everybody whom I've shown the movie to loves it. School children were crazy about it. We did a show in Faridabad for 900 children, and they all took their self-realization. Many people got their family members into Sahaj Yoga by showing them the movie. I could now see what was in Mother's vision. If we do the correct kind of movies and present them on the silver screen, then Sahaj Yoga will stay there forever. My meeting with Shri Mataji in Mumbai on the 10th of December 2002 was the trigger.

Interviewer: Thank you so much for taking this time out to share this absolutely amazing journey of a Sahaj Yogi artist. And also thank you to Mrs. Talwar for joining us because it just completes the whole picture. Thank you for wonderfully sharing these stories and the amazing times that we can only imagine and enjoy the vibrations of.

Thank you so much. Jai Shri Mataji.
