 (England)
Thank you for joining Shankarji and me for this evening's Zoom meeting on the Indian Independence Day. Shall we start this meeting with your recollection? If we could ask you where you were when you got your self-realisation, please, and what was the scenario like?

Alright, that's a kind of tricky question, actually. Not straightforward, unfortunately. I used to work for a friend of mine who had a shop in London. I lived in Somerset. He had a French lady working there called Chantal, and I knew her quite well. Then one day, I came back up to London to help out in the shop, and she had changed completely. She used to be a bit, you know, as they say in French, les misérables. Suddenly, she was all joyful and happy, and everything was great. She told me about Sahaja Yoga and said, "There's this lady, she's an incarnation of the Holy Spirit." I went, "Okay."

But she didn't tell me very much about it, and she never sat me down and sort of worked on me or anything. When I went back to Somerset, I just started meditating spontaneously. Sometimes, I would just suddenly feel absolutely silent inside, perfectly peaceful and tranquil. I didn't actually realize at the time it was due to Sahaja Yoga, but it went on for a few months.

Eventually, because I lived near Glastonbury, which is where all the seekers in the world go, and there's every kind of thing you can imagine there, I couldn't find anybody who was having the same experiences that I was. So eventually, a little voice said, "You need to go and find the people who feel the way you do." I set off on a pilgrimage, packed a rucksack and a guitar, left everything behind, and headed off to London. I went back to the shop to see my friend Randolph, and there was Chantal. She started telling me again about Sahaja Yoga. I was going, "Yeah, this is exactly what I've been experiencing: collective consciousness, you can feel how other people feel inside by putting your attention on them, and you can change the way they feel by working on them." So I realized that here were the people who felt the way I felt, and I just stayed in London and joined Sahaja Yoga. Still there.

Remind us of the time of the year.

When she told me, it was around the middle of the summer of 1982. She actually said, "You should come to this seminar we're having in Gloucestershire," which was Cowley Manor. I said, "Well, I don't know anything about this thing. I think I'd be a bit out of place." It was probably a good thing because Cowley Manor was an incredibly powerful event. Shri Mataji really laid it on the line for the first time that Sahaja Yoga wasn't just about meditating; it was about devotion to her, specifically. So I can place it in the fact that it was about a month before Cowley Manor, which I think was in August.

So what was your first meeting with Shri Mataji like?

I didn't attend the seminar. The first time I saw her was after she went to India for the winter. She used to come back around Sahasrara Day or maybe Easter. The first time I saw her in person was at a public meeting in Hackney Town Hall or something like that. They had set the stage up with a very nice little throne and lots of flowers. Shri Mataji came in and completely bypassed all the arrangements by walking in below the stage. She stood with the stage behind her and did the program, just wearing a plain, simple white sari as she always did. That was quite impressive, the fact that she cut through all the pomp and circumstance.

Then people were working on the newcomers. Victor Bertini was working on me because they said, "New people, come to the front." I thought, "Well, I'm kind of new because I've never seen her before," so I went up to the front and got worked on. She pointed out to people what their problems were. This would have been around May of 1983.

At the end of the program, I brought a flower. We all brought flowers, but my usual stance is always to stand at the back of everything, partly because I'm a few inches taller than everybody else and I'm always embarrassed if I'm at the front. So I'm standing at the back, and there's a big crush around Shri Mataji. I thought, "Well, there's no way I'm going to get to see her with my flower." I'm just standing there, and Shri Mataji actually said, "What about that gentleman? Did he feel anything?" and she pointed at me. It's like the crowd parted, and there was this corridor. Shri Mataji was sitting there, and it was me with my flower.

So I walked up and gave her the flower. She said, "Did you feel anything?" which was a bit tricky because I used to feel a lot, but actually, at that meeting, in her presence, I didn't feel anything. Perhaps the vibrations were blocked on my Vishuddhi. So I sort of said, "Well, yes, I thought something." She went, "Okay." So that was the first time.

After about three months, I moved into my first ashram, which was in Queen's Park. There were a lot of young men there, all about 18, including Victor, Ian Crawford, Daryl, and Paul Duncan. They were all musicians, so after dinner, they'd all eat and then go next door and start playing music. So I did a lot of washing up because I was the old guy at 30 years old. They were all about 18 or 20. You know what it's like living in ashrams with young men—they're not very well-trained in the domestic arts.

Those were the exceptional times where Shri Mataji would spend so much personal time with the Sahaja Yogis. What was it like being with her?

One of my first experiences was when Shri Mataji had bought this house in Brompton Square, and the Sahaja Yogis were still working on it. Somebody, because I'm a carpenter, said, "Could you come and fix some floorboards in a cupboard in Mataji's house?" I went, "Yeah, okay, cool." He said, "Bring some wood with you." My style, as it was and still is, is to always try and pick up wood out of a skip or something that's being thrown away. I always try to avoid paying money if I can.

I found some wood in a skip, very conveniently. "Oh, this is just perfect, floorboards." I went along and spent a couple of hours inside this cupboard under the stairs, fitting these floorboards. I just had my last piece of wood and my last gap in the floor, and I thought, "Oh, I wonder if this will fit." I got this last piece of wood I had, and it just dropped in—a perfect fit, not even a quarter of an inch to spare. I was just going, "Wow, that's amazing."

Suddenly, I was aware of somebody standing behind me. Shri Mataji was standing there, looking through the door into the cupboard. She said, "How's it going in there?" What can I say? "Yeah, fantastic, thank you, Shri Mataji, very good." She said, "Anyway, I think you've spent long enough inside that cupboard. Time to come and relax a bit." So we all went out into her bedroom, and there were about five of us. We sat on the floor, and Shri Mataji sat with Sir C.P. on the sofa, very relaxed. She had her hand on his knee. We watched a Hindi movie, and Shri Mataji was explaining the plot to us. I was just going, "Wow, this is amazing, sitting here, relaxed, watching a movie with Shri Mataji." It was very nice. She had a very good way of putting you at ease, making you feel comfortable like that.

I worked quite a lot on Brompton Square, and I got a few cookery lessons from Shri Mataji at the time—how to chop onions, how to prepare quail. The chopping onions is pretty simple. You cut it in half, top and tail it, peel it, cut it into slices one way, then the other way. The point is you can knock off an onion in about a minute or less. And little tricks like with garlic, you whack it with the back of the knife, and the skin just falls off, which makes it really easy to peel.

We had to prepare 24 quail. She was having a dinner party for some of Sir C.P.'s diplomatic friends, so we prepared a lot of food. That was also quite interesting because I went with her one day to Southall. We did a lot of shopping. I was driving the car. She went to this one particular butcher and bought a lot of stuff—birds, meat, sausages, whatever it was. When we got back to Brompton Square, she said to me and Terry—Terry was the husband of Neeta, who was the cook—"Put the meat in the fridge, not in the freezer." We both nodded. I didn't take any notice because Terry was in charge. He got it wrong and put it in the freezer. For some reason, the freezer got unplugged. She said, "This meat's actually no good. Take it back to the butcher and tell him the meat's no good. You want it all replaced, free of charge."

It's not the sort of thing I'm good at; I'm rather apologetic usually. She said, "Don't apologize. Just tell him." So we loaded it all in the car, and I went to the butcher's shop. I walked in with this large amount of stuff and said, "This stuff is all off and it needs to be replaced." And the butcher just went, "Okay," and he replaced it all. I was going, "Wow, that is amazing." You didn't have to do or say anything; it was just all arranged, perfect.

So we cooked this huge dinner. There was a ton of food left over, so the next day, Shri Mataji actually arranged a little Griha Lakshmi puja for all the builders. We went around, probably about 20 of us, and had the puja in the front room at Brompton Square. We all washed Shri Mataji's feet, and then we all sat down and ate all the leftovers.

The dining room at Brompton Square was highly ornate, with mirrored tiles on the ceiling with some sort of gold filigree design, which made the room look twice as big. It was in the basement, but the mirror made it look huge. It was kind of strange because you could look up and see everyone upside down, eating around the table. That was a nice event.

We used to have puja every Sunday at Chelsham Road at 11 o'clock. We'd go along early and polish all the brass every week—the statues, the thalis, the plates, the lamps, everything—with Brasso, which is really smelly stuff. It smells of kerosene. Later on in India, Shri Mataji said, "This polish you're using smells a bit strange. Just use salt and lemon or something." Of course, being human beings, they went from one extreme to the other and just cleaned it with salt and lemon and never polished it. So all the brassware got more and more dull. Eventually, Shri Mataji said, "You can actually polish it as well sometimes." Imagine her coming on this planet and looking at human beings and thinking, "How am I going to give them all realisation?" Their brains are so complex and limited.

After puja at Chelsham Road, sometimes somebody would stand up and say, "Shri Mataji has invited five people to go to Brompton Square and help move furniture. Is anybody interested?" I would think, "Is this a trick question? Why isn't every hand in the room in the air?" But they weren't. It was strange. Most of the time, if you wanted to go, you could, because people weren't volunteering. So we got to go quite often. You got to know the furniture very well because one week we'd move the walnut wardrobe from the bedroom upstairs down to the second floor, and then two weeks later, we'd move it back up to the top floor. The point was, she just really wanted to keep us busy, give us something to do, and not just sit around.

One time, we had gathered at Brompton Square, and I think it was the day after the Ganesha puja in Brighton, which was an amazing puja. In that talk, Shri Mataji really laid it on the line that chastity was absolutely vital and what it really was. It was such a great talk. Some of the people who had gathered there sat down at Shri Mataji's feet and were meditating. She actually blasted them. She said, "Why are you meditating? You didn't have permission to meditate. Who said you could come and take my vibrations?" I was standing at the back; I didn't actually feel it was quite right. Apparently, I was right because she really blasted them.

But then she was talking about the puja and said, "Yes, I'm sorry that I had to talk like that, but it was necessary." I just said something like, "No, Shri Mataji, it was wonderful." I hardly got the words out of my mouth, and something exploded in my heart, and I just went into complete bliss. It was amazing. Shri Mataji nodded and said, "Oh, we've got something here." A few times in the early days, I would have that sort of experience where my heart just exploded with joy. I guess being English and all that repressed emotional side was being released slowly, slowly.

The Hampstead meeting was our big meeting of the week. Every Thursday, we all went to Hampstead. There would be at least 100, maybe 200 people there. It was packed out, an amazing meeting. At the end of every meeting, we all stood and sang "Jerusalem" and the three great mantras. Actually, we didn't sing the three great mantras in those days; that was started by Hemlata, I think. She sang it at Cabella once. I believe it was composed by Ravindra Jain. He was an amazing guy. He died a few years back, but he wrote "Mamta Mai" and "Anyata Sharanam." Shri Mataji spoke about him, how he really saw things about her which other people hadn't, like the fact that other incarnations had come to establish dharma, but she'd actually come to give self-realisation. Shri Mataji was very keen on him. I'm pretty sure he composed the three great mantras in Raga Jaijaivanti.

As a seeker, how did you... because Sahaja Yoga is very much an internal journey... how would you describe your spiritual ascent?

The thing that struck me when I got self-realisation—I'd been a seeker for 30 years, so I'd already done a lot of seeking—was that I understood there were all kinds of ego trips you can get on, which are very exciting, but what you couldn't find was real, solid peace. That was what was missing. So when I had my experience, I just suddenly went absolutely silent and peaceful. I knew this was it. This is what I've been looking for. All the scriptures suddenly became clear. Like Jesus gave a lot of parables about a man who was a dealer in pearls, and he discovered this one pearl of great value and sold everything he had just to get it. I thought, "Yeah, this thing, this is it. Everything else has to go compared to that."

I've not yet managed to establish that as a permanent state, unfortunately, but it's still something I go back to. The other day, I was on the tube, just feeling quite thoughtless and being a witness. It's not an empty state when you're in your atma because you feel peace in your Nabhi and love in your heart, compassion for everyone else. It's a very active kind of silence. You're not doing it, but it's working. So I guess spiritual development is just learning to be that. Like Ramana Maharshi says, "Just be what you are," which sounds terribly simple but is hard to achieve.

My meditation mostly these days is, I just keep attention on Muladhara Chakra and say the Ganesha mantra continuously. Eventually, because Shri Ganesha works everything out, and the Muladhara Chakra solves everything, I don't really bother with anything else. Eventually, you get in a state where you're connected to Shri Mataji's feet, and you're not saying anything anymore. You just go into the bliss. It's all very simple. I don't really do many treatments; I just keep attention on Muladhara Chakra until I get there.

Is there any miracle or experience you wanted to share with us that happened to you at the International Sahaj Public School?

Going back to Brompton Square again, Shri Mataji had indicated that because I was an educated person with a degree, why was I just doing building work and being a carpenter? She sort of indicated I should do a bit more with my education. So I thought, "Oh, well, I could do teaching." I decided to apply for a teacher training course. I had just filled out the form in the little back room behind the kitchen, and I walked into the kitchen, and Shri Mataji was there. She said, "Oh, hello, what have you been doing? You've been sleeping." I said, "No, Shri Mataji, I've been filling out this form for teacher training." She said, "Oh, okay, give it to me." She took it, gave it a bandhan, sort of looked into space, and then nodded and handed it back to me.

I did the teacher training course but never took up teaching in England, partly because we were always busy building. I think the total amount of time I spent working on Shri Mataji's building projects came to about seven years if you added it all together. And there were people who did more than me, like Pat and John Watkins. She did like to keep the English busy so we didn't get into mischief.

I remember painting the Shri Chakra that we have outside the art block in the academic building at ISPS. I think it probably needs renewing again. I made that; Ian and I worked on it together. I've been making quite a few Shri Chakras recently.

What's the significance of that Yantra?

Well, I've just completed a book about the Shri Chakra. Yantras, in general, the way the design works is that the outer bits are the outer parts of us. The square is the body, and the lotuses are the psyche—usually eight petals, representing the five senses with the mind, perception, and ego. As you go in, you become more and more subtle. The central dot is the formless God. Symmetrical designs focus you in; they bring your attention to the center, which means technically you're becoming connected with God, and all the outer stuff is falling away. Shri Mataji was keen on it and mentions it many times—the Shri Chakra on the left shoulder and the Lalita Chakra on the other side. She indicated that we should learn more.

To my mind, she always encouraged us to learn more, to delve into things, to find the connections between Christianity or Judaism or Islam and Sahaja Yoga, and to write books and show people the connections. It's a very enjoyable occupation, just to be free to spend your time meditating and researching these topics, which is what I'm doing in India. It's a great blessing, undoubtedly.

Have you been in a situation with Shri Mataji in a building context where she's explaining something, and you're sitting there as a tradesperson, listening to her explanations and trying to catch up, thinking, "Wow, is that going to work out?" and then it just does?

Yeah, lots of things spring to mind. There are many. Sometimes she would say things... she wanted mirrored windows in Ealing, but she was sure you could get ones that would let all the light in but still be mirrored. We didn't find them. At Ealing, her kitchen had a room next to it with a door in each wall, which was crazy. We thought what we needed was a door into the kitchen. Shri Mataji herself suggested we close off a door in the small room and make the window in the kitchen into a door. So we did that. Then the next time she came, she said, "No, I don't think we want a door in the kitchen. We should make it back into a window and put the door in the small room." We nodded, yes, but of course, we didn't do it. We kept it as it was.

Probably one of my favorite stories was when we were working in the basement at Cabella. The castle was a thousand years old, but the foundations were 2,000 years old, from an old Roman castle. The walls were five feet thick, made of massive blocks of stone. Yogi Mahajan had come into the basement and said, "Oh, we should turn that window into a door," which sounds very simple. All you have to do is remove the bit below the window. Well, two people worked on it for two weeks and didn't manage it. A group of eight Swiss people came down with jackhammers for a weekend, and they didn't achieve it. Eventually, myself and the other carpenter, Michiel, finally worked out that the answer was not to try and cut through the blocks at all, but just to remove whole blocks and then build back what was needed. So we did eventually get it done.

Then we went to see Shri Mataji. She was designing the kitchen in the basement, and we'd been working on it for a few days. She would call up me and a Greek architect called Michaelis. Quite often, we would go up together. One time, she said, "What we need is a window in this kitchen. It's too dark." This was interesting because she'd never been down there, but she knew everything. She looked at the drawing and said, "Make a window. We need one about there," and she put her finger on the drawing. We looked and gulped. "What's the problem?" she asked. "Well, the walls are five feet thick," we said. She went, "Well, just have a look."

So we went down to the kitchen and started picking off the plaster on the wall where she had put her finger. After a while, we started to realize there was a line of masonry, an old opening. We picked away, and sure enough, there was an old window there which had been filled in and plastered over. Within two hours, we had pulled all the stuff out, and we had a window. It was unbelievable.

The next day, we went to see Shri Mataji, and she said, "So, how did it work out with the window?" We said, "Funny thing, Shri Mataji, just where you put your finger, it turned out there was an old window. We opened it up, and there's a window there." This would have been 1990.

Love, my son, saw Shri Mataji on his first birthday. We'd made a cake for his birthday and took it to the castle to share with the Sahaja Yogis. They said, "Why don't you give it to Shri Mataji?" No one had seen her for about a week because she'd been unwell. So we went up with Love, Radha, and me. She was there, and we sat at her feet. She talked a bit and gave Love some sweets. There was a glass of water on her table with some letters from Sahaja Yogis. Love sat on her lap and knocked over the glass of water, soaking all the letters. I'm scrambling around, trying to find a cloth to mop it up, and she's going, "No, no, it's fine. Just leave it."

Anyway, we had to build a staircase from her kitchen up to her bathroom. We kind of gulped because that staircase would cut through another staircase, but not at a level where you could combine the two. She said, "The problem with you is you only think in three dimensions." We thought thinking in three dimensions was pretty clever. She said, "You have to think in four dimensions." Michaelis asked, "What is the fourth dimension?" She said, "It's spirit." But we never actually managed to achieve that.

Shri Mataji would arrange things so that if you worked flat out, non-stop, you could get it done. That kind of total, flat-out work carries more vibrations. You're much more open; you can't think, you just have to get on with it. We were preparing Hounslow House for her to move in, and Pat and I were there. We worked for three days without sleeping. During the daytime, I would go shopping and get all the materials. Then we'd have dinner and start the night shift. You can only do that when the vibrations are supporting you. We got it ready, Shri Mataji came and moved in, and we left and slept for about a week.

She always bought buildings where every single thing needed to be fixed, from the very foundations—every bit of plaster, every piece of wood, the plumbing, the electrics. Everything got fixed, which meant it got vibrated. She never bought anything that didn't need total renovation.

I remember once, Shri Mataji described thinking as "anti-God activity."

Is there any advice Shri Mataji gave you that you would like to share?

Yeah, she gave me some advice about marriage. I'd been in Sahaja Yoga about seven years. I was married before, but Shri Mataji arranged for us to not be together by sending her off to run the school in Rome. So we didn't really know what was happening. Sometime later, I happened to be in her bedroom at Shudy Camps, and she said, "Oh, we should get you married." I went, "Just whatever you want, Shri Mataji." She said, "Hmm, the problem is you're very tall. Tall women have a lot of ego. Actually, all tall people have a lot of ego." She sort of looked into space and went, "Yeah, it'll be okay."

So we went on the India tour that year, and I got paired up with an Australian lady first, who didn't want to talk to me. A bit later on, my marriage was announced with Radha. This was in 1990. At the end of the announcements, I went up to Yogi Mahajan and said, "Can I see the form of who I'm matched to?" He showed it to me for about three seconds. I just got a brief glimpse of Radha. Someone went, "How does she look?" and I went, "She looks quite serious."

When we got to Ganapati Pule, they had a session where the couples would come up, the men on Shri Mataji's left and the women on the right. They'd kneel in front of her, and she would nod her approval. My name got called, so I went up and sat next to Shri Mataji. Radha appeared on the other side of the stage but didn't come towards Shri Mataji. She was standing there looking extremely nervous next to Baba Mama. I didn't know at the time, but apparently, she had just gotten off the bus from Bombay, totally sweaty and destroyed from a 12-hour journey. Someone had said, "You're needed on stage," and she didn't know what was going on.

Shri Mataji said, "She's very dark." I'm like, "Fine, Shri Mataji, that's not a problem." She said, "I think she is saying yes, but very slowly. It'll be okay." So I left the stage, and Radha left, but nobody knew what had happened because she hadn't come to Shri Mataji. There hadn't been any sign of agreement. I went and sat back down, and a group of Russian ladies behind me tapped me on the shoulder and said, "Don't worry, we'll find you a nice Russian wife." I said, "No, no, I think it's going to be okay."

Shri Mataji called Radha up and sort of told her off a bit, saying, "Why don't you like this marriage? He's a good man." She went, "No, no, I do like it, Shri Mataji."

When I was in her bedroom, she gave me some advice on marriage which was very useful. She said, "Don't criticize." She knows me, of course. I'm a very critical person. But we all do it to a certain extent. It was probably the best advice, really.

The English bhajan singing... Shakuntala came to the UK and taught us how to sing bhajans properly, how to pronounce the Marathi and Hindi. We practiced two songs for the Shri Hanuman Puja in Margate: the Hanuman Chalisa and the Hanuman Stuti. We performed them on a Saturday night, and Shri Mataji was very pleased. She said, "You must do these in the puja as well." That was the first time I really remember her being pleased with the English bhajan singing. The Swiss music group, led by the Ekta Pravah brothers, transformed bhajan singing in the whole of Sahaja Yoga. They studied how the Indians sang bhajans and copied it.

Thank you so much for joining us this evening.

It's been very enjoyable. Yes, there is more. Chelsham Road is another story. And plenty of other stories, historic ones. We should regroup for another session.
