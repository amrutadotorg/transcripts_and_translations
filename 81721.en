Dharamshala (India)
I belong to Dharamsala. In 1976, I got my realization. Like everyone else, we have a great desire that Shri Mataji should bless our hometown. So on several occasions, I happened to mention and pray to her to come to Dharamsala.

She said that Himalaya is my father. It is my home, and I can go there anytime. But first, I want to be in the world to spread the message of Sahaja Yoga and complete my mission. And in the end, sometime, when everything is done, I'll return to my hometown. She said, "I am Shailputri. I am the daughter of the Himalayas." So I let the matter rest.

In 1985, Shri Mataji's birthday puja was in Delhi. Normally, she departs for England after her birthday celebrations in Delhi. There was a gap of about 10 days between the birthday puja and her departure, and there was no program elsewhere. So I mustered courage and I broached the subject again. "Shri Mataji, now there is the time and you need some rest." She looked at me quite amused with a twinkle in her eye, and she said, "Okay, let's go."

So without much preparation, we boarded a train from Delhi station to Pathankot station with a handful of Sahaja Yogis. In Pathankot, I have a family house just outside in Mamoon Village, so I wanted to dedicate it to her. She held a public program there and spent a day there. We had a small puja and I offered the house at her lotus feet. She said, "I think we should open a school here for the village." So she named it the International Sahaj School, Pathankot.

Thereafter, we left for Dharamsala. The main town is called Kotwali Bazaar, which is lower Dharamsala. We had an ancestral house here in Kotwali Bazaar, and she spent the night there. In the evening, there was a public program which the Lions Club of Dharamsala had hosted at the Dhauladhar Hotel. The anchor was very poetic and he started reciting verses, which we call shers, and she enjoyed them very much. She gave a very sweet and loving talk to all the public and the members of the Lions Club. She explained that the lion was her vehicle, her vahan. So she said it was the work of the Paramchaitanya that the Lions Club should host her. And in that warmth and grace of the Mother, everybody received their realization. For follow-ups, we opened a center in our family home.

Next day, we went to the ashram in Talnoo. As we crossed the fork from where a small road bifurcates to the ashram, she felt tremendous vibrations. She asked for the car to stop. She got out of the car and she felt the vibrations coming from a patch of land. She said, "This is the place where Durvasa Rishi had meditated." We didn't know much about Durvasa Rishi. Then she explained that he was a very right-sided rishi and very hot-tempered. One day, the goddess appeared to him and said, "You need to cool your right side, so go to the Himalayas." So this is where he did his tapasya. She said, "You should build a temple here." So she drew out the odd-sized land. She somehow managed to fit the temple there, according to the vibrations. Later, it was constructed, and she blessed it.

Then, as we entered the ashram, she stood before the Dhauladhar Range, which is the first range of the Himalayas, and she did pranam to her father, the Himalaya. She stood silently with her eyes closed for about 10 minutes. We knew that there was a dialogue between the father and the daughter, and we all went into deep meditation. There were tremendous vibrations. And she gifted a photo of her father, symbolically, to the ashram. That big portrait was later used for the printing of all his photos in various books.

The next day was the puja in the ashram. She said, "We'll do Shailputri puja." All the Dharamsala yogis and some hundred yogis from all over India were there. Raul Bhai was there, Rajesh, everybody was there. After the puja, it got late. It must have been about 11 o'clock at night. There was a full moon. From the ashram, we walked down to the cottage where she was staying, and she looked at the Himalayas. They were glistening; the snow was glistening under the moonlight. She said, "See how the vibrations are cascading from the Himalayas."

We looked up. We couldn't see anything. So quite humbly, we confessed, "Shri Mataji, we don't see any vibrations." She looked at us very piercingly, and she said, "Now look." And then we saw the vibrations cascading down. We were absolutely like in a waterfall, enveloped by these vibrations. We totally lost any sense of identity. That experience, that moment, stayed with me for many days. I could see the vibrations, but I could not see them. So I realized that it was her gift to us for that particular moment, a blessing that we could see it. And then it never happened again.

That night, I think she must have gone to bed about 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning. The next day, there was supposed to be a small program, but she never woke up. We thought she'll maybe wake up late, so we delayed everything. But for several hours, till late evening, she slept and she slept and she slept. I've traveled with her several years, and I never experienced this long spell for many hours. Then late in the evening, she woke up suddenly looking like a very young girl, maybe 19 or 20. We looked absolutely amazed. She looked so fresh and so vibrant.

Before we could even ask her anything, she said, "I was so relaxed. All my tiredness was sucked by the saints who were meditating in the Himalayas. The whole night, they were sucking my vibrations. So I was just so relaxed that all the tiredness of the marathon world travels has gone. And I'm ready with a new body to start all over again with all my energy." And then we mentioned, "Shri Mataji, you look like you're 19." She said, "Sometimes I give you glimpses of my real self. Because my body gets heavy and puffed when the vibrations get jammed inside. So people think that I've put on weight. But actually, when the vibrations go, then I'm not this heavy-looking person that you think I am."

Then the next day, there was a public program at Dal Lake. We had spread the word to the villages across the snow mountains. People had trekked for days to reach from the interior villages of the Himalayas. Because these are all worshippers of the goddess, and they'd never heard of her, they'd never seen her. But just from her photo and the posters, they said the goddess has come, the Devi has come. There were no questions asked. They walked miles and miles for days and days to reach the spot.

About 5,000 villagers had assembled. And just as Shri Mataji stood by the lake, there was a green patch where we had arranged the opening. She didn't even say anything. They were singing, and she just said, "Here," and she put her hand up. She said, "The vibrations are coming from them to me. They've got it." She didn't have to say anything. She didn't even have to follow the regular routine of giving realization. The villagers were so overjoyed they started singing and dancing. They were singing the Pahadi bhajans, and she just sat there and was enjoying their vibrations. She was so overwhelmed by this realization program that she sent a letter to me from Bombay, which is in the ashram. You will see it, expressing her joy at meeting these people.

And then we drove back towards Pathankot. We had an evening train. En route, she was enjoying the beauty of the Himalayas, the greenery, the flora, the fauna. And I think she read my mind because I had this earnest desire to see God. Of course, she was God, right before me. But there was a mental concept that there is a God Almighty somewhere. And how do I see that God?

Again, she looked at me from the corner of her eyes. And she said, "Look at the beauty of the mountains. This is the beauty of God. Why don't you just enjoy it instead of thinking about it?" And I was stumped. She said it so naturally, as if it was a matter of course, or something so simple. And I'd spent my whole life thinking about it and wondering about it and reading books about it. And it was as simple as that. It left me absolutely speechless. I went into total silence. And in that silence, I could feel the silence of the mountains, which I'd never felt before, even though I'd lived all my life in these mountains. I suddenly felt and saw them very differently. And I realized, yes, that's what it is. After that, that whole fixation about God left me.

That experience led to the writing of the book, The Face of God. I said, "This is the face of God, and I never saw it before like that." She guided me on how to write the book and what the subjects were. I didn't know about her past, she told me, and some essays that she had written, and family history, and all that was compiled in that book. But that book was from a very early period of Sahaja Yoga. It did not record the years later on. She read three volumes of her biography: The Tenth Incarnation, first volume; Kalki, from '90 to 2001; and The Last Judgment, from 2001 until she took Samadhi. So, this was a sequence of events that took place.

The following year, she suggested that we take the India tour to Dharamsala. "Let them enjoy the vibrations of the Himalayas," she said. But the India tour came in December, and Dharamsala is cold, and it snows. The Europeans, the Americans, the Australians who come, want to escape from the bitter cold of their countries at that time. They were not so eager to come to another cold mountain in the middle of December. So, we postponed that.

And then, in years to come, she sent the school children there. In '90, there used to be a preschool in Switzerland. Due to some government intervention, the school had to be shut down. So she telephoned me from Switzerland, "Can you put them up in your farm?" Of course, I was more than happy to do so. Meanwhile, there was a preschool in Melbourne. As it was not registered with the government, they had to shut that down. So, the Australians lost no time, and they requested her whether they could send their children. So, 25 Australian children also came. We converted our barn into a dormitory and school rooms. The farm transformed into a preschool. And then, the Sangha all over toyed with the idea of sending their children. Seventy children. So, that gave birth to the idea of a school, a Sahaj school.

She started building the school in Vashi, in CBD Belapur, and this building was completed. But come summer, the children started getting sick. They had malaria. Somebody had jaundice. Half the school felt sick, and it became like a hospital. So, Shri Mataji said, "Well, it's better you move the children back to Dharamsala." But we needed to construct more rooms for them. So, she gave me 10 lakhs of rupees and said, "Go and build a school for them." And she drew out a building plan like a castle, basically, the concept of a Maharashtrian Wada, where you have a courtyard in the middle and the building on the four sides, so that when the children play inside, they are secure. The Western yogis gave it an exterior of a castle. The children moved back. And then, the school grew and grew and grew.

And that is the story of the apple orchard.
