Welcome, Shweta, for this session. A brief one today, just to tell us how you got your Self-Realization and what your meeting with Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi was like. Please.

I came to Sahaja Yoga in the '90s in a small town in Siberia, Russia. I got Self-Realization from one of my colleagues. He was meditating and had a huge portrait of Shri Mataji on the wall. I asked him about it, and he explained everything. At that point, I believed in God and was desperately searching for a connection. I went to church, but I was disappointed and not satisfied. I felt that couldn't be it. And then I tried Sahaja Yoga.

When I received my Self-Realization, it was just a usual meeting with a few people, probably five to seven. I was very skeptical at first because everything was new. All I knew was Christianity and Christ; I didn't know anything else. Once I received my Self-Realization and opened my eyes, I immediately felt immense love and joy. I saw the people around me and thought, "This is interesting," in spite of my mind being very cautious.

I should mention why I was searching. When I received my Self-Realization, I was 25. I found myself different from other people; I couldn't fit in with what others were interested in. I had inner barriers; I didn't want to do those things and didn't enjoy them. I thought I was alone and that no one would support me. I thought I wasn't normal. I tried to push myself, to break myself, to become "normal," but it didn't do any good for me. Once I joined the Sahaja Yoga collective, everything made sense.

Very nice. And the word "normal" has different meanings now, pre-COVID and post-COVID. I think the understanding is a vastly improved one.

Yes. Currently, I'm speaking with my children, my daughter, and my young niece. The main thing in modern times is not to lose what's normal, because many things become popular and you think, "Oh, it's okay." But no, there is something that is normal. It's a new definition.

Can I ask you about a miracle that you'd like to share with us? And also about your first meeting with Shri Mataji?

Well, one of my first big ones, which I still think about... there were many, little and big. This was when I first came to Sahaja Yoga, and I still hadn't seen Shri Mataji in person; I was just meditating. I was coming back from a Sahaja meeting, from meditation. It was evening, dark, I'm sure after nine o'clock.

I was walking, absolutely blissed out. There was no one around on the street. I could see a group of youths walking on a different path, and our footpaths were about to cross. I realized what I'm describing now later on; at that moment, I was just walking, oblivious to anything. When our footpaths crossed, this group of youths divided, and they were on both sides of me. I just walked through them.

Once I had passed them, I could hear a commotion. They started making sounds like, "Oh! What happened?" Then it kicked in, and I realized something was supposed to happen, but they didn't seem to realize it themselves. I just walked through them.

Wow. That is amazing. Very, very special. It's that blissed-out feeling, isn't it? This is what happens; miracles become a part of life, and so we don't even think about it. That's just how we know life.

Yes, you're still aware of it, but there are so many of them. All thanks to Shri Mataji.

Is there any other experience you would like to share with us, Shweta? How was it when you went back to work? You were meditating and you said you didn't fit in. How did that change things for you?

It did change things. I am still human, but after coming to Sahaja Yoga, as I said, everything makes sense. We still get entangled with problems, but you know where to look for help. You know how to physically help yourself, so you get out of it much quicker. Really, I don't know how people live without Sahaja Yoga, without this faith. It's becoming part of my life. It's part of me; it's what I am.

Yes, that defines you, isn't it? Because it's a way of life. That is what I identified with as well. Not fitting in and yet looking for something which made sense. And when I got my realization, it was that feeling like, I've come home. Like, yes, this is what it is.

Yes, exactly.
