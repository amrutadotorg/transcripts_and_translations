Jai Shri Mataji, everybody. We will just raise our Kundalini and slowly put a bandhan. Let's just close our eyes. All of us, try to put our attention on the Sahasrara with a prayer: Shri Mataji, we are humbly trying to record this session with the blissful moments we have spent with our dear mother, Adi Shakti. Please give us your blessings.

We can say the three Mahamantras:

Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Mahalakshmi Sakshat Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devyai Namo Namah.
Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Kalki Sakshat Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devyai Namo Namah.
Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Kalki Sakshat Shri Sahasrara Swamini Moksha Pradayini Mataji Shri Nirmala Devyai Namo Namah.

Slowly close your eyes, put your attention on yourself. Jai Shri Mataji. Thank you, Shri Mataji.

Interviewer: So, Uncle, to start today's session, the first and foremost thing which I want to understand, and which I would like to let our viewers know as well, is what is the objective of today's session? What exactly are we trying to achieve?

Uncle: We, and some of us, had the good fortune to be in the company of Adi Shakti when she was here. The main objective is that all those beautiful, blissful moments we spent with her, we would like to share them.

Second, is to tell you about my father, Pai Kaka, as he was very well known in Mumbai. He was very well-loved in Mumbai and so, as far as Mumbai Sahaja Yogis are concerned, I want to mention some places where he used to have the programs, so that in case anybody wants to go and visit those places, they can. And third and last is how it is with us after 2011, when Shri Mataji left for her heavenly abode. This will be a part of the 100th birth anniversary of Shri Mataji, which we are celebrating this year. Does this answer your question?

Interviewer: Yes, yes, Uncle, it does. This is the first in a series of sessions. We will try and do three to four sessions. Avdhut Uncle has been part of the Sahaja Yoga community for a very long period of time now. I think, Uncle, since 1972, correct me if I'm wrong?

Uncle: Yes, April 1972.

Interviewer: April 1972. So we will try and take you through his experiences of the time right from the start, spent with Mother. Uncle has some photographs that are not publicly available, so I will jump right into these photographs and then we'll try and share Uncle's experiences.

So, this is the first photograph, Uncle.

Uncle: Yes, this was taken in 1973. I remember these years because we were studying at that time. I was in SSC, Secondary School Certificate. It was not 10th, it was 11th standard. Just after the realization, Shri Mataji was to go to Vasai, and this photo was taken in Vasai. The story is that because of our exams, we did not go. We were staying in Vikhroli, and Vasai is on the western line, so Shri Mataji was to catch a train in Bombay Central with all the Sahaja Yogis and my parents. I think in Andheri or Borivali, they were to catch the train. My father thought Shri Mataji could not take a third-class ticket—that time it was first class and third class—so he took a first-class ticket to Vasai. And then he realized that Shri Mataji was with all the Sahaja Yogis in a third-class compartment. So, this is a small incident.

That time, Shri Mataji went to the UK in December 1973. This photo is when she used to come to Bombay. When she was about to leave, she used to hug all the Sahaja Yoginis. Here she is hugging one Sahaja Yogini. She used to cry and the Sahaja Yoginis also used to cry. We were all there. Unfortunately, I don't know the year. I will tell you the year as far as possible, but sometimes I will not be able to tell you the exact year.

This is one of the photos where Shri Mataji used to come with us. She used to sit with us to eat. You see, on her left and right-hand side, there are Sahaja Yoginis sitting, and it was not a very special place. She used to eat on the ground.

Interviewer: Next.

Uncle: Now, this is a photo of Shri Mataji talking to someone. On the right-hand side of Shri Mataji, there is a small tape recorder. I would just like to tell you a small incident about this tape recorder. My father got his realization... I mean, the person holding the mic is Mr. Pai Kaka, my father. He got his realization in January 1972 and he came in April. There were some seminars in Bombay at Cowasji Jehangir Hall. When he attended the seminars, he said that what Shri Mataji is saying is so important. He was so much impressed, and he thought somebody should tape these talks.

A few days later, his friend told my father, "I would like to sell a tape recorder because I want to buy a new one." And my father said, "Yes, yes, I'm ready to take it." It was rather costly, but his friend said, "Okay, you can pay me in installments." Since then, from about '73 to '80, we have seen this tape recorder. We used to take this tape recorder everywhere.

In '83 or '84, I was alone at home, and Shri Mataji sent a note with somebody saying, "Please give all your recordings to this person." Now, we had 36 spools. Each spool is six inches, and there is 14 hours of recording—four tracks of 3.5 hours each. So we had 36 spools. All these recordings went to the UK later on and came out on Amruta and different places.

We used to tape everything. If there was music, like by Ajit Kadkade, we used to tape it and put it in a small cassette. I used to do the postage part of it, like a postman, and I used to take it to Shri Mataji so that when she went back to the UK, she could listen. This tape recorder was so precious at that time. Shri Mataji even put kumkum on it once. These are small incidents.

Interviewer: A very important thing, Uncle. I think all the early talks were recorded on this only, I guess. I'm also just seeing the Cowasji Jehangir Hall sessions. These were on the 23rd, 24th, and 25th of March, 1973. I can see these sessions online on amruta.org. To anyone who's listening, if you want to listen to these sessions, they are available on amruta.org. Three continuous sessions by Shri Mataji. The audio is not that great, but you can read the entire lecture online.

Uncle: Yes. We used to buy rather good quality BASF or TDK tapes at that time. And in the beginning, my father used to say, "This is the session, talk given by Shri Mataji on such and such topic," and he used to give the date. So even if the paper we had with it was lost, the information was on the tape. So, we had 36 spools.

Interviewer: Very helpful for all the Sahaja Yogis, Uncle, to say the least. In her early talks, Shri Mataji has spoken about a lot of things. A lot of details.

Uncle: Yes, which are really important. At that time, we did not have many. So at home, I used to listen to these talks so many times. The same talks, like "How to Meditate" in '76, the Gudi Padwa talk in Delhi on 30th March... all these talks I heard, I don't know how many times. It is just a memory.

Interviewer: Mayank, it would be great if you could just put up all these links in the YouTube link as well.

Uncle: So, this was in January 1977. I was sitting behind Shri Mataji, on the right of Shri Mataji. You can see some of the Sahaja Yogis. Right in the front, on the left-hand side, there is Mahendra Chavan. If you know him, he expired some years ago. On his left, there is Mavin Kurve. Then there is Dumal Uncle behind, in the third row. And also there is Warick Kaka in the center. Behind, there is a person from abroad, Patrick, Grijna's husband. Then in front of him, there is Warick Uncle, who used to be with us, a very, very deep Sahaja Yogi. There are Gavin, Maureen, and other Sahaja Yogis. There is Ratnapak Uncle on the right-hand side, right behind. Then there was Bobde Bai from Kolhapur, just behind Shri Mataji on the left.

Interviewer: This photo is at Nargol, Uncle, correct me if I am wrong?

Uncle: No, no, it was in Bordi. Previously, we used to have all these seminars in Bordi. We came in '72, but it was till February '85. And in December '85, Ganpatipule started. As I recently heard Shri Mataji say, Nargol did not have buses or roads, it was not possible. So we used to have it in Bordi, which is not very far from Nargol. When you come from Bombay, you get down at Gholvad station after Dahanu, then we used to walk a bit. We used to stay there. There is a bungalow behind, which was rented or lent to us by Mr. Diwanji, who is on the left of Shri Mataji. So this was a small group at that time. You can see we were rather small. I am not in this photo, and there were about 10-15 more people. It was a rather small group. Most of these photos were taken by my father, but many of them were given to me as a present.

Interviewer: Very nice, Uncle. We will go to the next picture. This is again at Bordi, Uncle?

Uncle: This is also the same photo which we saw just now, but from a different angle.

Interviewer: Uncle, this looks very familiar. It looks like Nargol.

Uncle: Yes, it is the same seashore. I don't know how many kilometers before Nargol.

Interviewer: Just for my understanding, Uncle, why did so many Sahaja Yoga seminars used to happen on the sea? Is there any specific reason for that?

Uncle: I don't know exactly why on the seashore. But I remember some incidents. Shri Mataji used to sit in the water with her feet straight in the water. As children, we used to put our heads under the feet of Shri Mataji. You can imagine, with the waves coming in, we used to try to go under the water. We used to have a competition to see who will stay longer at the feet of Shri Mataji. We did not know Shri Mataji was really vibrating the Arabian Sea so that all the clouds can be showered upon Maharashtra or other states. I think this was one of the reasons.

Also, in Bombay near Marve, we used to have a place where on Akshaya Tritiya, which is a very auspicious day in the Hindu calendar, we used to have a puja. Shri Mataji used to come for the whole day. We used to hire a bungalow and have a puja, a havan. I remember once in the evening, Shri Mataji took all of us on the wet sand. We were about 15, 20, 25 people. We had made a round circle and were standing on the wet sand. I remember Shri Mataji told us that wet sand is the best element to absorb all our negativities, all our problems on our chakras. Since then, whenever I go to Ganpatipule or any seashore, we do this. We can do this three-point treatment, wherein you sit on the ground with your hands behind and your heels dug in the wet sand. You bend your knees, so your Muladhara is touching the ground, your heels—which is the Muladhara of your feet—are in the sand, and your hands are behind. This is a three-point treatment we can use whenever it is possible to clear our Muladhara on the seashore. Just a small incident.

This is the full group we had at that time. You can see Shri Mataji right in the middle, but I think she is looking down.

Interviewer: This was the total number of people who had come to the seminar? This looks only around 50 to 100 people, right?

Uncle: Yes, yes, it was very small at that point in time.

Interviewer: Right now, these many people would come to one center, I think. In a seminar, there are tens of thousands of people.

Uncle: Yes, I understand. Even now in Ganpatipule, there are tens of thousands of people.

Interviewer: Also, Uncle, you must have gotten a lot of personal time with Shri Mataji as well.

Uncle: Yes. At that time, we did not realize the importance of these moments which we spent with Shri Mataji. But she knew she was preparing us.

Interviewer: Next please.

Uncle: So in Bordi, we were doing this puja. On the left-hand side is my father. He was the first pujari in Sahaja Yoga because he knew a lot of mantras. On the right-hand side, the photo is not full, but I was pouring water on Shri Mataji's feet, along with other small children. Shri Mataji is deeply in meditation.

Now this is, I think, the India Tour in 1980. It should be somewhere on the seashore.

Interviewer: The Bordi pictures we were just looking at, Uncle, they were from which year?

Uncle: The previous ones were from '73, '74, till '76, I can say. Because in January '77, we had our brothers and sisters from abroad who had come to India for the first time. There was Pat, Krishna, Maureen, Gavin, and all the other people. But before that, it should be between '74 and '76.

Interviewer: I can see the first lecture in Bordi was on 25th of January, 1973. I think this is from that point of time, I guess.

Uncle: So here, Shri Mataji was giving us instructions to do the havan. I was writing down, jotting down the points on the left-hand side. She used to completely organize the havan, exactly as one would want it. She used to put kumkum on her head and everything.

So this is the photo where Shri Mataji is putting kumkum. On the left-hand side in the red top is Aradhana, Shri Mataji's elder granddaughter, and Anupama, her younger one. And I am on the right. There is another small boy.

Interviewer: We will pause the photos here, Uncle. We will have the next round of photos in the next session. I just wanted to ask you a few questions. First and foremost, I wanted to understand how did you come into Sahaja Yoga in the 1970s? How did you get your realization?

Uncle: Now, before I go ahead with these questions, I would like to say two or three things. The fact that we came into Sahaja Yoga much before others does not make us any more evolved. When I see some of these new Sahaja Yogis, especially the young ones, I am really surprised at their dynamism and their innocence and their surrender to Shri Mataji. I feel that basically, if there is a lift going from the ground floor to the seventh floor, you come on the first floor, and some people come on the fourth or fifth floor. At the top floor, everybody is at the same level. I basically believe that we have only seen what happened from the first floor to the fifth floor. Shri Mataji kept us in Sahaja Yoga, in her domain, because it's only the Adi Shakti who decides whom she should take to the lotus feet of Shri Sadashiva.

The second point is that if we are expressing some things, showing the photos, and telling the experiences, it will be a first-hand experience. It's not somebody who has heard some things. It will be a first-hand experience because we will not be here for a lifetime. When we are not here, there will be some recordings remaining for those who have never met Shri Mataji or seen her in person. Also, if anywhere my ego interferes, I ask Shri Mataji to forgive me. But I'm telling whatever I remember, and I'm telling you only the experiences which are good and useful for the collectivity, not very, very personal things which Shri Mataji told us. My one and only motivation is that people should try to realize Shri Mataji—not understand, but realize Shri Mataji—and go into the Nirvikalpa state. This would be a very beautiful present for her 100th birthday.

I could be a bit emotional because Shri Mataji literally brought me up. My earthly mother left us when I was rather young, I was 27. Shri Mataji brought me up before 2011 and afterwards. We'll come to that later on. Sometimes I really am in a completely different realm when I talk about Shri Mataji.

So, how we came into Sahaja Yoga... my father got his realization in January '72. Then he brought us to Sahaja Yoga. It was the 14th of April. I was in the 10th standard, and at that time Shri Mataji was giving realization in her house, which was situated in Napean Sea Road. On the corner, there was a building called Jivanjyot. I think it was on the second floor. Sir C.P. had a flat there, and there I got my realization. We used to go to her house, and she used to give realization. She used to sit with her legs out, and people used to go and touch her legs, and she used to massage their hands also. When my turn came, it was on the left hand of Shri Mataji. She put Brahmi oil on my head, I still remember. And she said, "How do you feel?" I said, "Fine." She asked my name and she liked it. That was my first experience.

Interviewer: What was your experience of feeling the vibrations for the first time while meditating with her? How was it? What did you experience?

Uncle: Basically, in the beginning, I did not feel vibrations at all. We used to have a public program in Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan in Mumbai. On the third floor, we had a Gita Mandir hall where we used to have morning and evening public programs in '73. From '74 onwards, when Shri Mataji used to come, we used to have them in the evenings, very regularly. Shri Mataji used to come, she used to talk, and we used to tape it with our tape recorder. And then, after every single public program, we used to go to her feet. The new people used to go to Mother's feet, and we used to work on them. We used to tell which finger we felt slight catches on, and we used to work on them.

Slowly and gradually, I started feeling the vibrations. But I cannot tell you exactly which date or which time I started feeling vibrations.

Interviewer: So, it was a slow process for you, Uncle. Feeling the vibrations took some time, right?

Uncle: Yes.

Interviewer: I think that's a very important message for all the yogis who are trying to seek. It might take some time, but when it comes, it will stay with you forever.

Uncle: Exactly. It's an irreversible process. It's like once you become a tree from a small sapling, you can't become a sapling again. Shri Mataji talks about it in one talk; she says that once you grow into a tree, you cannot become a small tree again.

Interviewer: Okay, Uncle. I just wanted to know any experience that you might have... it is said that through Sahaja Yoga, our karmas are cleaned. We get cleaned physically. Any experience that you would like to share on this particular front? How exactly does Shri Mataji clear our karmas?

Uncle: Yes. This is a very strong experience. I had two really strong experiences. One of them is about cigarettes. As a young boy, when I used to go to college, I used to go with friends for a picnic once a year. We used to go somewhere around Lonavala or Mahabaleshwar. Everybody used to drink and smoke. I also used to smoke, not drink, because I couldn't bear the smell right from the beginning. So, smoking, yes. Two or three cigarettes the whole night, just for fun.

The last time I had smoked was in January or February. I was in Goa with some friends and I smoked. On the 5th or 6th of February, I think it was a Panchami Puja in Mumbai. At that time, we used to have a lot of pujas, and there was Achala Bai, one of the 12 Sahaja Yoginis who got realization in the beginning. We had this puja on her terrace. After every puja, we used to go to Mother's feet. So, when I went to Mother's feet, Shri Mataji suddenly said, "Avdhut, did you smoke?" My heart literally stopped because I had smoked just one week before. I still remember Achala Bai saying, "No, no, Avdhut will never smoke." But I knew in my heart that it was the real thing.

Again, I used to go with my friends for picnics, and two or three cigarettes per year continued. In '78 or '79, we went to Dhulia, and Shri Mataji wanted some Sahaja Yogi to put a hand on her Vishuddhi to take out the vibrations. She said, "I want some man who has never smoked in his life to put his hand on my Vishuddhi." And of course, the Indians used to have bidis, and foreigners also smoked. So, everybody said, "Avdhut, why don't you go?" I put my head down and said, "No, let anybody say anything, but I will not go again because I have smoked." I told Shri Mataji, in front of everybody, that I had smoked. I forgot about the incident. Shri Mataji did not.

We were there for the whole day. In the evening, there was a public program in a small village. Inside the hall there was light, but outside there was darkness. I was there with another Sahaja Yogi, Suryavanshi. Suddenly, I smelled cigarette smoke on my fingers. I don't know if it was both Vishuddhi fingers, but at least on the right side. And I said, "Oh God, where is this coming from?" I told Suryavanshi, "You are the proof that I did not smoke. See the smell." He said, "Yes, yes."

I quickly, very discreetly, went and washed my hands very nicely with soap and dried them. The smell was still there, as if I had put my finger in tobacco paste for a year. It was very strong. Then I said, "It's a real problem." At that time, we could go to her room. So, I went and knocked and told Shri Mataji that my fingers had a smell of cigarettes. She said, "Okay, okay, come." She took my two fingers in her hand, my Vishuddhi fingers, for two or three minutes. Then she let go and said, "Okay, now see if you have the smell." I saw that the smell had gone.

Shri Mataji said, "Because you accepted this morning that you have smoked, I have cleaned you completely. I have taken that cigarette smoking incident out of your life. So now if you tell anybody that you have never smoked in your life, that will be true." She told me all these words, almost. Then she said, "Now promise me again that you will never smoke." I said, "Yes, enough." Obviously, I never used a cigarette again.

Later on, in the West, I had an MRI scan for my brain. The doctor said, "Your brain is so clear. It seems you have never smoked in your life, because otherwise there are these stains." Even another doctor told me the same thing. I said, "Yes, yes, I have never smoked in my life." So, that is how Shri Mataji takes out our karmas, from whatever we have done.

Interviewer: Shri Mataji, Uncle. Brilliant experience to hear. I literally went into thoughtless awareness listening to the entire experience.

Uncle: Yes, I can see myself going into that room on the first floor of Rawalbhai's bungalow, and Shri Mataji holding my fingers.

Interviewer: So, just to understand, Uncle, you spoke about how Shri Mataji clears our karmas. It's also said that she cleans us physically. Any experience that you would like to relate on that particular front, where you could actually feel her cleaning you physically?

Uncle: Yes. So, this photo, which we haven't seen yet, is of a place called Nilambar on Pedder Road. We were on the 13th floor, we were in a flat.

After my B.Com in '78, Shri Mataji had just come. My father said, "You can go with Shri Mataji wherever she goes." It was the best moment of my life. For almost a year, I was with Shri Mataji. I was in this flat, and I used to take care of things. There was a cook, and I used to go with him for buying things. I used to buy Plants of India for Shri Mataji every morning.

So, your question was about the physical cleaning. What happened was, once we had a public program or a puja in Birla Kreeda Kendra in Chowpatty. The whole day I was outside in the sun, and I'm very sensitive to the sun. In the evening, we were sitting in front of Shri Mataji. Every evening was just a laughter session; Shri Mataji used to make us laugh like anything. But I was having a terrible headache. Shri Mataji said, "What's the problem, Avdhut?" I said, "I've got a really strong headache because I was in the sun."

So, she said, "Come," and she told me to put my right hand on her liver. I was there for about 10 minutes, she was laughing and talking. In about 10-15 minutes, I felt like vomiting and like I had diarrhea. I said, "Shri Mataji, I want to go to the toilet." She said, "Yes, yes." So, I really vomited, and all this bile came out, and I also went to the toilet. Then I came out, and the whole headache was gone in just a few minutes. Then Shri Mataji asked me, "How do you feel now?" I said, "Yes, fine, fine." So, this is how she can physically clean us.

Interviewer: Wow. That's very nice to know. So, essentially, Mother cleared out all the issues like this, and it came out in the form of bile or diarrhea?

Uncle: It's not basically negativity, we can say. It's more of a physical cleaning. I remember another time, at a place called Satnam Apartments where Kalpana Didi was staying. I used to go, as I said, to give the cassettes or other things. Once when I was going, I met Shri Mataji in the lift. I don't remember whether she put her hand on my head, but she said, "Put your hand on your head." In the lift. I put my hand and said, "It's hot." She said, "Yes, very, very hot." She asked me, "From where are you coming?" I said, "Sachivalaya." From Sachivalaya to there is rather far. She said, "No, no, you should always put a cap on your head when you are going out in the sun." So, it's just to protect us. I would not say it's negativity.

Interviewer: Okay, Uncle. I've often heard from a lot of older Sahaja Yogis that Mother used to actually know what was going on in their minds. Any instance that you would have faced with Mother wherein she actually knew what was going on in your mind and you were surprised as to how she was aware?

Uncle: The first incident is that right from my childhood, I had some problem with my left ear. At some point, it was even operated on before and it was leaking. I put some drops and antibiotics, but nothing worked. I was with Shri Mataji and I said, "Shri Mataji, can you please see my ear?" She said, "What's the problem?" I said, "There's a problem, it's leaking." So, she said, "Okay." She took my ear in her right hand, my left ear, and she started blowing in my ear.

Suddenly a thought came in my mind: "Whatever all those antibiotics or these drops did not work, what will just blowing do?" I took a doubt on her blowing in my ear. She immediately let go of my ear and said, "Why are you doubting? Why are you thinking like this? I am putting the Pranava in your ear." I didn't even know the meaning of Pranava. She said, "I'm putting the Pranava in your ear." I pulled my ears, but of course, it was too late.

Another thing I remember was we were in Rahuri. After lunch, people started reciting couplets, small poems which should rhyme. Everybody used to say one. Some people said, "Why don't you tell one, Avdhut?" Immediately I prepared some couplet in my head. But Shri Mataji didn't ask. In the evening, again, we had this session of couplets. And again, some people said, "Why don't you ask Avdhut?" Then, finally, she asked. And I told this couplet. I still remember. It meant, "In the plate, there is a small bowl, and in that, there is a vegetable. Let me have Sahaja Yoga in all my lives. This is the prayer I say at the feet of Shri Mataji."

When I said this, Shri Mataji said immediately, "But this you have prepared in the afternoon. This is not a new one." I said, "Yes, Mother." Even to prepare one was so difficult. I didn't say yes, but then she said, "How did I know?"

Also, once, what happened was, we used to stay in Vikhroli. My father used to work in Godrej, and we had staff quarters. Shri Mataji came to our house three times. From there to Nilambar in Grant Road is very far. So, one day, early in the morning, my sister and I had to go there. Only we used to take a bath in the morning, but we said we didn't have time, so we went directly. There were some foreign Sahaja Yogis there in Nilambar. Shri Mataji told them, "You see, this brother and sister, they have come all the way early in the morning. They take their bath every day. They have taken their bath in the morning and they came here." I looked at my sister. We did not know where to look. Shri Mataji was teaching us that when you go to see Adi Shakti, you take your bath and try to be as pure as possible from outside and from inside. These are some of the instances where I can say that Shri Mataji knew what was going on in our mind.

Interviewer: I just wanted to understand, how would Mother protect her children? Have you ever felt that protection coming from Mother?

Uncle: That was the second instance which really marked me very much. As I told you before, we had this public program in Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan. I was, as usual, sitting in front to tape. Suddenly, Shri Mataji looked at somebody with a very stern glance. I saw later on that it was a Sadhu Maharaj with a big beard and long hair. He came and just sat behind. We had the public program, everybody went to Mother's feet, and it was finished. Before Shri Mataji was about to go, he left and came from the other side, as if he wanted to block Shri Mataji's way. We were ready to intervene in case he did something to Shri Mataji.

In the beginning, I was very curious, and I asked him if he wanted us to work on him. He just motioned with his hand to leave him alone. But the whole evening, my attention was on him. When he came in front of Shri Mataji, he literally fell on Shri Mataji's feet like a coconut tree would fall. Shri Mataji just put her hand on his arm, and he gave a very big sigh of relief. And he went away.

Later on, we asked Shri Mataji, "What happened? Who was he?" Shri Mataji said that they are Hatha Yogis. They come from the Himalayas, and they know that she is here. We know that only Adi Shakti can give realization. He knew that she was here. For these people, their Kundalini is blocked on the Agnya Chakra, and when it is blocked, it is very painful, like 100 bees stinging at the same time. So, when she put her finger on his Agnya, the Kundalini shot up. He got his realization, and that was very blissful for him.

He went away, and we were quite surprised. Then, immediately, she said that we Sahaja Yogis don't feel that much pain in our Agnya Chakra when our Kundalini is blocked. We might feel a little pressure on our Agnya or on our finger, because her protection is always there on our head like an umbrella. It was such a big thing. I remember that very much.

Interviewer: About these Sadhus, Uncle, did they used to come to Mother's programs quite often?

Uncle: No, no. What I heard is that before, Shri Mataji went to the Himalayas and they said that they would come to help her when things were ready. They did not believe in compassion and love; their method is different. There was this Gangad Maharaj you must have heard of. He was the one who was rather close with Shri Mataji. We had a tape of him where he said that when Shri Mataji was born, he saw the Shri Chakra, the Lalita Chakra, coming on the ground. He knew that Adi Shakti had taken birth on the earth. He said this in Marathi. We never had these real people coming to our programs.

Interviewer: I understand, Uncle. Thank you so much. Moving ahead, I wanted to understand the small little things... how exactly would Mother fulfill our desires? We have small little things that keep going on in the back of our heads. Any instances that you would like to quote on that?

Uncle: Yes, small instances. In Rahuri, when I was a young boy, I used to run about doing a lot of organization. It was an oval table, and we all had to sit for lunch. Everybody had sat, and there was one chair left on the left-hand side of Shri Mataji. So, I took the chair and sat. They used to give us chapatis. I used to like chapatis with butter. For us, it was without butter, and for Shri Mataji, it was with butter. They brought hot chapatis with butter for Shri Mataji, I think there were three or four. Suddenly, Shri Mataji took one chapati and put it on my plate. I said, "No, no, Shri Mataji." She said, "No, no, I know you like it." Maybe I had that desire, but she knows what you like.

Also, another thing was that we were in Solapur, mostly in '78, '79. There was a room in which we were staying. When we were going out at about 10:30 or 11, a thought came into my head. I said, "What vibrations!" I knew there was somebody sleeping in this room, I didn't know who. I said, "The person who is going to sleep here is a really lucky person." Then we went to sleep in another room. Suddenly, Uncle Dhumal came to our room and said, "Is everybody okay there? If you don't have a place, you can come to our room." Shri Mataji's room. He was sleeping there. I didn't know before. So, I took my bedding and slept in that room where Shri Mataji was sleeping.

It was a rectangular room. On one edge, Shri Mataji was sleeping. On the other edge, there was Uncle Dhumal. I was in the middle on the ground. When I came to the room, Shri Mataji was already asleep. At some point in the night, I suddenly felt somebody touching my body on the left side. I opened my eyes. Shri Mataji had crossed over me to go to the toilet because the room was not very big. Perhaps she did not see me. I suddenly got up and realized it was 4 o'clock, and I was in Shri Mataji's room. Obviously, the sleep went away. Shri Mataji came out, and when she went inside, Dhumalji said, "Shri Mataji is cleaning Solapur the whole night. She has been vomiting." From 4 to 6, she used to tell me to massage her left Nabhi, and I did not know she was working on my left Nabhi at that time.

Then, I told Shri Mataji, "You know, last night when I was about to go to bed, I thought, 'What good vibrations are here. The person who is sleeping is a lucky person.'" She said, "That's exactly why I called you here. Just because of that thought, I brought you here."

Another thing was in '78. We were in Dhulia. My mother was there. She went back to Bombay, and we came to Delhi. She had lost her sweater, so she said, "Since you are in Delhi, you can get good sweaters there. Why don't you buy one for me?" When we came to Delhi, there was one Mr. Verma. He used to go with Shri Mataji for shopping. Many people gave presents to Shri Mataji. I just had it in my mind, "I am a student. I don't even earn anything. What can I offer Shri Mataji?" The thought went out. Then I told this Verma Uncle, "When you are going out, can you please buy a sweater for my mother?" He said, "Okay."

Then he came home and said, "Shri Mataji really liked the sweater." I said, "What sweater?" He said, "The one you bought for Shri Mataji." I had said "my mother," my physical mother, and he had heard "Shri Mataji." It was a very lovely Kashmiri sweater. See, my thought, I really wanted to buy something, but I didn't have the capability to buy. This was the last piece remaining and Shri Mataji liked it. Whatever you think, whatever desire you have, it works. It's not only when Shri Mataji is here. Let me just tell you, even after 2011, if your desire is pure, all your desires will be fulfilled. Shri Mataji says in a talk, "Powers of Sahaja Yogis, 1980," all your desires. Just we have to have this purity of desire, and that will work.

Interviewer: Yes, yes, Uncle.

Uncle: In '77, we went to Jaipur. As I told you, I was a postman. We had these imitation pearls, very good quality, like real pearls in Jaipur, very famous. And there was this Bandhani saree, also very famous. My father said we should buy one for Shri Mataji. We bought it and I took this saree and a small garland for Shri Mataji. Shri Mataji said, "No, no, why are you bringing all this?" I tried to be smart and I said, "Shri Mataji, all that you gave to us is in three dimensions, but what you have given us, it's in four dimensions." So, immediately she said, "So, give me back in four dimensions."

Interviewer: Uncle, any small instance that you would like to quote of Mother's love for her children? How she would probably take care of them?

Uncle: Yes, very much. In '76, '77, for her birthday, we used to have a pandal on the terrace of a building opposite the garden adjacent to Siddhivinayak Temple in Prabhadevi. This building is demolished now, but there we used to have every Saturday meeting and birthday programs on the terrace. Shri Mataji used to come around 9 or 10 in the morning. We used to have puja, evening bhajans, and we used to eat together.

After the puja, at times, we were not enough people to absorb her vibrations, or maybe we did not have that capacity. So, she used to sleep, and we used to put our hands on her—the men on her head and back, and the ladies on her legs—to absorb the vibrations. Once Shri Mataji would say, "Where are you?" I said, "I am on the heart." She'd say, "Come a little bit down. Yes. Now, go on the right, on the left." She used to allow us to take the vibrations out.

One thing I may just tell is that, at that time, we had a lot of possibilities to massage her head. She allowed us to touch her head. In one of the talks, Shri Mataji said even Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh could not touch her head. And she allowed us to touch her head. How much liberty she had given us.

We used to be there the whole day. In the evening, she used to go home. In one of those years, there was Mr. Arun Pradhan's car. There were a lot of garlands. They said, "Why don't you come to help take the garlands up," to Satnam Apartments. I went. In her flat, there were so many people standing inside and outside. They were colleagues of Sir C.P. who had come for maybe two, three, four hours or more to wish Shri Mataji for her birthday. And Shri Mataji was with us the whole day. How much time she gave us. When I think of these incidents, I really go into another world.

Interviewer: The vibratory flow in the entire session has been excellent. Today was a difficult day at the office. To be very frank, I felt completely cleansed during the session. I think the session can go on and on. The experiences that we have spoken about are only between the 70s and the 80s. But I think we should end this session here with a small meditation and carry forward with other experiences in the next session.

To the people who are listening, we are creating a series of these videos in which we'll try and listen to all of Avdhut Uncle's experiences with Mother, his experiences after Mother was not there in her physical form. So, we'll keep having these sessions. We are planning to have three or four such sessions, but we'll end today's session here. Jai Shri Mataji, Uncle. With Mother's permission, if it is okay, we could go for a small meditation session and then end.

Uncle: Okay. We can all go into meditation. The mantra which helps me a lot to go into this state of Nirvikalpa is just to remember that Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, who is the power of God, came on this earth and lived with human beings. But she was a Mahamaya. I always felt that if demons can come as gods, why can't God come as a human being? Fully camouflaged. So, she came, she chose us as her children. My only desire and wish is that she should not feel in any way disappointed for giving us the realization. Our entire behavior, thoughts, words, and deeds should be molded in such a way that it should behove a Sahaja Yogi. I am a Sahaja Yogi. Let's remember this. It will trigger us into meditation. Put our attention on the Sahasrara.

Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Mahasaraswati Mahakali Trigunatmika Kundalini Sakshat Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devyai Namo Namah.
Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Kalki Sakshat Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devyai Namo Namah.
Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Kalki Sakshat Shri Sahasrara Swamini Moksha Pradayini Mataji Shri Nirmala Devyai Namo Namah.

Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Ki Jai!

Interviewer: Jai Shri Mataji, Uncle. It was a wonderful session today. By Mother's grace, there were a huge amount of vibrations as well. I also experienced Nirvicharita during this session. So I wanted to thank you. I wanted to thank Mother for the wonderful experiences that we had today. With this, we would like to close this session. To everyone who is listening, we will be circulating links for the next session shortly. As I mentioned, there would be at least three to four sessions which would be a part of this series. We will try to capture Avdhut Uncle's overall experiences about Sahaja Yoga, the time he has spent with Mother, as well as any kind of advice that he would like to give to new yogis who would want to know and understand more about Sahaja Yoga. So with this, we would like to end the session here. Jai Shri Mataji.

Uncle: Jai Shri Mataji. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you, Shri Mataji.
