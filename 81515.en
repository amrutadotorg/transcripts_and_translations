And the interesting thing is that he was so excited, he wanted to go and tell everybody—all these people we knew that we thought were seekers. We went around to their houses and said, "Guess what, this has happened." And they were all kind of, "Oh yes. Yes, yes, well, me too. That's happened to me as well." And we were thinking, "Well, no it hasn't," because I could see what had happened to John. He was totally transformed. These people weren't totally transformed, but they were saying, "Oh yes, yes, that's happened to me as well."

People really, I think, thought that John was in his ego, and they didn't take to Sahaja Yoga. They weren't even interested. They didn't even come along to a meeting to find out what had happened. I remember John being very, very disappointed. He fell out with his best man and best friend because he was a Christian who had just discovered Christianity. He used to tell me about it, and I used to think, "Oh, please, give up."

Then, when I went to tell him about it, I didn't know anything other than things that were in the Bible, because obviously I'm a Westerner brought up on Christianity. And I was telling him what these things meant, and he was saying, "Well, I'm also realized." I'm thinking, "But you're not." He thought he had also had... what's the word when you become overwhelmed? Enlightenment. So he also thought that he was enlightened. I don't know what he thought of me, but after that, I never bothered with him because it was just freaking me out.

Is that how Francis convinced you to go and see Shri Mataji, or to go and do the meditation?

To meditate, yes.

So what was it, Francis, that catalyzed this? What kept you going all along, knowing that he had to meditate?

I think I always knew, after our first experience with Shri Mataji, that there was something very special about her. If you were going to have a guru, if you were going to follow a spiritual path, she was the one. There wasn't anybody else. She was the one, and she was the best.

We were going through a bit of a difficult time. John was working very, very hard, and I think I was pregnant with Dan, our second child. I was having a lot of trouble with the first child because he was quite lively and difficult. And to tell the truth, John had two jobs; he was working during the day and going out at night. So I was looking after a difficult child, being pregnant, and never seeing my husband. I thought, "What can I do?"

For some reason, Mother was obviously telling me what to do, and I said to him, "Okay, you can carry on with your job in the evening." This was just a ploy, really, because I didn't want him to carry on with it. My aim was to get him to stop. I said, "Yes, it's okay, you can carry on with it, but you've got to promise me that one day a week we'll go to the meditation class."

So he said, "Oh, all right then." I just knew inside that if I could get him to go to the meditation class, he'd give up this mad work thing. And he did. We started going to the meditation class in Birmingham, and John actually stopped all this working. We became poor again, but happy.

And so that's what brought us back in at that time. I meditated, and we came along solidly for about a year while I was pregnant with Dan. When he was born, he was a very calm and peaceful baby, unlike Tom. So, yes, that was that little story.

Thanks. Robert, you knew a lot about the second system...
