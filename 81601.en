 (England)
Reeves came to the door and said, "Oh, hello, come in. We're having a meeting upstairs." So I went up the stairs and looked around to make sure they had an exit, in case things were going to happen. They said to sit down, and I sat on a chair, and they started working on me. There were just a few people there, and then I started feeling this energy flowing in my hands. I thought, "Wow, that's it."

Then they started explaining my catches to me. They said, "Oh, you're catching because you've been doing lots of reading." I said, "Yeah." I thought, "Wow, these people are really good. They know what's happening." They said, "There's a problem with your mother." What had happened was, I had left home and wasn't in contact with my family. What I discovered afterwards is that your parents are inside you, and because my mum was worrying about me, I was actually feeling the physical pain. It was a pain like someone had whacked me. I thought it was maybe down to work, because of the plaster, but they said, "No, it has to do with your mother." So I thought, "Oh, God, I better ring her up and go and see her and tell her I'm fine," because I was concentrating on finding this thing.

They explained that to me and said a few more things, and I thought, "Wow, that's it." But then I said to myself, "Oh my God, if I tell anyone, they're going to say I'm completely mad." So I got up out of the chair and said, "Thank you very much." They said, "Oh, we're here every week. Come back and see us." I ran all the way home—it was a steep hill—and I ran all the way home thinking, "I found it! That's it."

When I went back to see my family, I said, "Well, I can go back to work now because I found it." People were saying to me, "Oh, there's something different about you." I said, "What do you mean?" They said, "There's some change in you. Tell us what it is." I thought, "No, if I say anything to people, they're going to start asking me lots of questions about it." So I said, "No, no, it's nothing." They said, "No, no, there's something about you. We know there's some change in you." I said, "Yeah, when I find out a bit more, I'll let you know."

In those days, they didn't used to answer many questions. Afterwards, I discovered I was asking lots of questions which they couldn't answer. I kept asking them, and they said, "We don't know." I said, "Who knows?" They said, "Shri Mataji." I said, "When can I see her?" They said, "You can't see her." I said, "What do you mean? Is this a cult or what? What's going on? Why can't I see this lady?" They said, "Do you want to see her?" I said, "Yes." They said, "Oh, okay. We go and see her every Monday. Would you like to come?" I said, "Of course I want to come! I'm asking you all these questions you can't answer."

So they said, "Okay. Be here at such and such. There's a minibus. Jump in and go down to London." Shri Mataji was at Caxton Hall. I thought, "Wow, yeah. There is just something special about her." I could feel vibrations. I said, "Well, I know it's something."

After a few more weeks, they said, "There's a ceremony we have. It's called a puja. And this one is a Saraswati Puja." This was the 5th of May in 1981. They said to me, "Would you like to come?" I said, "Yeah, of course. I'd like to come along." "We've got a minibus. Come down with us." I said, "Great." They didn't explain anything about where we were going. So I got my flask and my packed lunch. I remember thinking it was going to be a long day.

So I turned up at Chelsham Road and sat down in the room. It was packed; there were loads of people there. Shri Mataji's chair was there where it normally is. She gave a speech, and then she said, "All those people who are here for the first time, who come from a country other than England, can ask for a boon for their country." I thought, "Wow." I understood what that word meant. You can ask for three wishes. I thought, "Great. What can I ask for now?"

I thought, at the time, the Rastafarian movement was growing big. I knew that it wasn't good because I met people in my community who were doing it, and they were smoking stuff and going off their heads. I said, "This needs to die down." That was one. Second, I said, "They keep telling me that this marijuana is a holy herb, something to do with King David or something. This needs to be neutralized." And then for the third one, she said, "I'll tell you what to say. You should ask that the Pentecostal movement subsides." At the time, they were having busloads of people, coaches going down from Bristol to London for Billy Graham. It was all people coming back like zombies. She said, "You should say that this needs to be stopped." So that was the third boon.

I'm sitting there. At the time, Gregoire was translating what I was saying to Shri Mataji, because of my Jamaican accent, or deep Bristolian, I don't know. But Gregoire was translating what I said. So I sat back down and I'm sitting there with my hands out, meditating.

At the end of the puja, they gave lots of presents to Shri Mataji. She was unwrapping them, and on her left-hand side, she would undo the wrapping and put it down. All of a sudden, the wrapping paper caught on fire and the flames started going up to the ceiling. Everyone was in the room, and nobody was moving. I was thinking, "What's happened? Why is nobody moving? This lady's going to catch on fire!" When wrapping paper burns, it's so fast. I thought, "Oh my God."

So I jumped up. I had a really nice brown corduroy jacket. I ripped it off my back, ran over, and smothered the flames. I put the fire out and then sat back down. In that time, it was like time stood still. Nobody moved. Nobody said anything. I was thinking, "What's happening with these people?" I just sat back down. Even up to now, all these years later, no one's ever asked me about it. At the time, nobody said, "What were you doing?" I was there. I just sat back down and thought, "Wow, these people are slightly different. I'll stick with it."

So that was happening within two months, and that was my sort of interaction.
