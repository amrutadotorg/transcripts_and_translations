Of course. Here is the cleaned and formatted version of the transcript, following all the specific instructions provided.

Interviewer: Thank you. Good morning and another sunny morning in England. Thank you for joining us. Felicity from Gloucestershire and Shankarji from the Garden of England, to do our interview with both of you. So, Felicity, if you want to ask the questions to Shankarji.

Felicity: No, I think we'll just jump in and continue where we left off because you didn't quite get a chance to finish. Where we left you, I think it was in Cabella, having got there in your renovated horse truck vehicle, traveling across Europe from England to Cabella. So, you just take it from there. Take us into it again.

Interviewer: Wait, wait, and I'll say I have heard—I've had a preview of what's to come today—and I've heard there's dreams, there's kind of little miracles, and a lot of Mother's content, so we're looking forward to this.

Shankarji: Okay, hi everyone. Thank you for the opportunity for letting me finish off the Bedford TK journey. As I started to get into the yoga more and the UK collective and dip my feet into the international European collective... and then I'll just take you on to a few dreams I had, a few little sort of visions which you might find quite fascinating, or even humorous. And then ultimately to a dream I had about Sushmita before we ever met, and our marriage, and the significance of marriage in society—my limited understanding of the Divine's intentions for human beings to marry and the importance of marriage to hold societies together.

So, okay, so in short, I was helping out John Watkinson-ji at Cabella for a couple of months.

Felicity: So this is... you're in Cabella? The castle that Shri Mataji bought that has become the world international center?

Shankarji: Yes.

Felicity: And at the time—so what year is this that you were there?

Shankarji: 1993 now. Yeah, at that point, the outside of the castle isn't done. You're just doing renovations, and it was a complete... it was almost derelict. And so you are working inside with the other yogis, the golden builders, to renovate the castle. And was Shri Mataji staying there at this time?

Shankarji: She came to stay for what they called the puja season in Cabella in the summer. In the early 90s, in the summer, yeah. And the puja pandal was an old circus marquee pandal, and it was up on the hillside next to the castle.

Felicity: I remember, yeah, next to the castle.

Shankarji: So, the outside of the castle was still to be properly worked on, and internally things were progressing as far as I remember. And certainly, I was just helping John out with a bit of painting and decorating. Then the puja season started. I didn't know anything about pujas as such, or the puja season.

Felicity: You understood the concepts; you've been exposed and seen the concepts. And at this point, how long had it been since you got your realization?

Shankarji: The year before, September 1992.

Felicity: Okay, so we're in the kind of late spring of '93, I think.

Shankarji: Six months, really. Six months, yeah. And because I had savings from my mum and dad's late estate, I kind of locked them away in some kind of funds. A friend of mine dealt with that for me. But when it came to actual cash in my pocket, Italian Lira in my pocket, I didn't have a lot. The Italian yogis would do the breakfast and the lunch and the dinner, and we'd all sit outside or inside down on the ground floor.

Felicity: So the other yogis were sleeping in the castle?

Shankarji: There were yogis sleeping, and I think they call it the mezzanine. It's the days of Finbar and Elizabeth, John and Padmini, George—Giorgio the tennis coach—George and Alison, yes, and Alberto and his dear Indian wife. Basically, Victor... it was the early days.

Felicity: And would Shri Mataji and Sir C.P. stay in the castle? And she would be directing the renovations as they were going on? And when you say you were helping John, was John doing plastering or what was he doing?

Shankarji: He was doing some ornate plasterwork and a bit of painting. He might have been doing some wallpapering, I'm not sure. At that time, it was probably just plastering. Later, Chris Marlow was there with his joinery skills. I think he was making and fitting a vase, which I think he refers to in his Golden Memories interview. So it was just sort of activity.

Felicity: It makes me feel that when we heard the memories of the golden builders in Brompton Square, that was like a dress rehearsal. That was like a practice for this huge castle. Because there was John doing all the plastering in Brompton Square, and now he's got these huge rooms with incredible ceilings. And the same for Chris. And you were right there in the beginning of it.

Shankarji: Well, I turned up off the side of the road, and they kind of took me in. I don't know what they thought of me, but it was very welcoming. Not knowing what I was doing in life, they were very patient. They'd help me out, advise me, and looked after me. For the Italians and maybe the European yogis there, it was all this sort of oddity, that this English guy had turned up in this old truck. And here he was. They took me in and looked after me big time.

And so the pujas had started now. I'm pretty sure it was the Shri Adi Shakti puja that came first for me. And I remember people saying, "Oh, well, you need puja induction, Shankar. You need a bit of money." And of course, self-realization is free; you can't pay for self-realization. Spirituality is free, full stop. But you've got to be practical. You've got to buy the food for the yogis, the visitors, you've got to pay for the hire of the pandal, etc., etc. You had to be practical. And as a devotee of Shri Mataji and just starting in the yoga, I was expected to contribute what I had. I didn't have anything, so I was really quite distressed.

I remember one evening, the yogis cooked a sort of pizza, and it was almost on the eve of the Shri Adi Shakti puja that would be held in the pandal there on the side of the hillside. People were telling me about this, and I'm going, "I haven't got any money." And then Robert Hunter came out from what I call the front of the castle, which is actually the bit that overlooks the valley onto this sort of arched bridge affair, straight outside the entrance. He said, "Puja induction." I just looked up at the balcony of Shri Mataji's room—she was there, of course—and I just thanked her from the bottom of my heart. Lo and behold, I could attend the Shri Adi Shakti puja, which was vibrationally full on. I didn't really know who the Adi Shakti was. I hadn't quite got there.

The penny was dropping very rapidly. In fact, the penny did drop in Plymouth when I looked at a video of Mother. Back in Margaret's place with the old VHF cassette recorder in her little meditation room, she puts on a Shri Ganesha puja talk for me. I'm sitting there and Mother's talking about Shri Ganesha, and then she's talking about Christ.

I just wanted to pop in here, for anyone viewing who's just got their self-realization or they've chanced—there's no such thing as chance and by coincidence they've come across all this on YouTube, Golden Memories—I just wanted to convey that the Divine... there is only one God, there is only one supreme being, but He has many manifestations, including His love and His power, which is Shri Adi Shakti, which is His feminine aspect, which is the supreme goddess. And even though we might be a Christian or a Muslim or a Hindu or a Jew or a Parsi, one has to sort of come around or be open to the idea that religions that were built and formed out of the incarnations of the time, whether it's Zoroaster for the Parsis, or Buddha for the Buddhists, or Abraham and Moses for the Jews... that's human beings adding to it all. Human beings created the religions out of the incarnations of the Divine and God, and organized God. And of course, how can an ant perceive the mountain? It's not possible.

So you've got to be open-minded. And the thing about the yoga is, when that Kundalini comes up—that reflection of the love of Jehovah, Allah, the supreme being, God Almighty, the Father—that's His love emanating from you. The Kundalini is the reflection of the Adi Shakti, which is love and the feminine force. You've got to get your sympathetic nervous system enlightened and sensitive to this, to the Divine. And then your conditionings of your place, your birth, your name, your religion... they just sort of gently drop away. And then it leaves you with an elated, uplifted state of being: the spirit, which is the reflection of God in your heart, in every human being. So when I talk about Shri Hanuman later and things and dreams of Shri Mataji, I don't want people to just lock into Hinduism or lock into Christianity. Try not to do that. Try and be open-minded, as I was when I discovered Sahaja Yoga, and as all the seekers of truth do.

So, the next puja is the Guru Puja. Now, that really appealed to me. I was still at Cabella. I attended the puja; it was very powerful. Because I'd been seeking, because I'd been in front of false gurus, whether it was the Babas in India, God bless them, my void, my stomach, my lower abdomen was churning with what we call negativity. And it was a big workout in that puja. You receive a lot of love and vibrations from the Divine, and it clears out whatever negativity you have in your subtle system. It's a gradual process, but after that puja, it was really strong in me. It was so strong that I wanted to run away. The negativity in me wanted to run away. I wanted to run out of the pandal at the end of it and get the hell out of there.

Felicity: But you were so new. It was a real, very intense...

Shankarji: It was all at once. Luckily, I didn't. There was something in me again, it was the voice of the spirit, the inner voice that Mahatma Gandhi refers to. He said, "Don't do it, Shankar. Just stand your ground." So I stood on the periphery of the pandal, inside the pandal. I'm standing there, and the puja has come to an end, and the yogis are singing devotional songs, bhajans, possibly qawwalis.

And then I found myself standing next to an American yogi, and we got talking. I told him my little history in my truck, and he went, "Gee, wow." He said, "After the puja, I really want to go and check out Europe, see Europe and do a bit of traveling. I could help you get your truck back to your farm in France. And by the way, I'm a Greyhound bus driver." I thought, "Wow, that's just what I needed: a co-pilot driver who could drive for long hours at a steady speed and get my truck back to Brittany, at the farm where I had the intention of going back to England and helping out at Shri Mataji's London residence, which was in Ealing, which I heard about from Chris and John."

So, we were off. That puja had ended. I think in the next couple of days, he came down to the truck and we started off, taking it in turns to drive.

Now, at some point, as we'd got past the Alps, the truck started playing up. What happened was, I couldn't afford to stall it. If I stalled it, I couldn't restart it with the ignition key. So that meant I either had to bump start it down a hill or get someone to tow me and bump start it. I mean, when you've got a seven-and-a-half-ton little truck, you don't want to be breaking down in the middle of nowhere. I had no AA/RAC cover; I didn't even have insurance for driving in Europe, so it was a bit touch and go.

What happened was, I did stall it. I couldn't restart it. We managed to bump it down a hill. But then when one driver was getting tired, the other one took over, but you've got to keep pressure on the accelerator to keep the revs up. You didn't want the engine to go into a very slow idle and then stall. So we'd pull into a gas station in France—I needed more diesel—and then he would take over the driver's seat. He'd slide over, and I'd slide out of the cab, keeping a hand down on the accelerator pedal, keeping it ticking over. Because when you're in a fuel station, you can't keep the engine on, but I didn't care. Luckily, the attendant in the kiosk there didn't pull me up on it. We had a few touch-and-go occasions at petrol stations refueling. But basically from the Italian-Franco border until we got to Paris, we just drove non-stop at 40 miles an hour, swapping driving when we could without stalling it.

Anyway, we got to Fontainebleau, which I think is a forest to the south of Paris. It was evening time, and both of us were absolutely knackered. We had to pull over for the night. There's no way we could have driven on into Paris in the night. This truck had no power steering; it was a screw mechanism steering device. It's really heavy on the forearms, and we weren't going very fast. So we decided to pull over. We pulled over in one of these lovely French continental picnic areas by the side of the high road, and he stalled it. The engine cut out, and I thought, "Oh no." It's too late to carry on. We'll just sleep for a bit.

He stalled it, and I'm going, "Oh no way, man, you let it stall!" And he goes, "No way, man, this truck's possessed, man!" And I'm going, "Oh, it can't be possessed." Anyway, we have this little argument, and I got all flustered. I grabbed my sleeping bag, and I just thought, "Bugger this, I'm going to sleep outside. Let him have the truck to sleep in." So I got in my sleeping bag by the side of the truck. The sun had gone down, it was getting dark, raining. So I crawled under the truck and burnt a blooming hole in my sleeping bag, a really nice sleeping bag. I was really annoyed I burnt a hole in it because it was all polyester.

In the morning, we couldn't get the blooming thing started. So we started hitching, and we got picked up... I hope I've got this right; if I haven't, please forgive me, but we got picked up by... I couldn't believe it, French Sahaja Yogis picked us up on the side of the road.

Felicity: That's a miracle! That's a miracle story. What are the odds? You're beside the road, and suddenly a car stops at that moment.

Shankarji: Yeah. "Jai Shri Mataji! Where are you going?" "Well, I'm going into Paris because I understand there's a public program Shri Mataji is giving in Paris, and then there's going to be a Shri Mahakali puja in Paris. And then I'm going on to Brittany to leave my truck at my farm, and then I'm going back home to the UK." He said, "Oh, no problem, get in." And they took us to the ashram in Paris. I couldn't believe it, that they found us. It wasn't a coincidence; Mother had engineered the whole thing.

As we were coming into Paris, we're getting into the suburbs, and I'd learned the three great mantras then, the Maha Mantras. I didn't know when it was the right time to say them or recite them, but as we were coming in, I was sitting in the back of the car, and I'm seeing Paris around me and feeling, "Blimey, this is a bit rough." I start saying the three great mantras to myself, but out loud a bit, and of course all the yogis in the car had to say it as well because I was taking them, and they had to join in. It wasn't until a bit later they politely said, "Look, Shankar, you're not really meant to take them all the time." And I went, "Oh, sorry, I didn't know that."

Anyway, we got to the ashram, got cleaned up, got fed, and it was time to go to Shri Mataji's public program. An Ayatollah—I don't think it was the big Ayatollah in Tehran at the time—but it was an Ayatollah who was there in Paris, from Iran, at the program.

Felicity: At the program? A special guest? Wow.

Shankarji: Yeah, I thought, "I'm going to go to that." But I've got to go to the bank. I've got to go into the center of Paris to the bank to get some money. I had to cash in some savings I had in the UK, and I couldn't do it in a provincial bank; I had to go into the city. So I said to the American yogi, "Thanks very much for your help. I've got to go out on my own now." He dropped me off at a bank in the city center and then left me there. I said, "Don't worry, I'll get to the public program, which was later in the day. I'll get there myself." He said, "Are you sure?" I said, "Yeah, no problem."

I was still invincible. I didn't have a map of Paris, but the yogi had given me the address and pointed in the general direction I had to go. So I lined up my navigation point with the Eiffel Tower. I knew I had to walk past the Eiffel Tower and beyond, but I had no idea how long it would take me. And it took me four hours to get there, walking. For some bizarre reason, I went in the wrong direction of the Eiffel Tower for about an hour, and then I twigged it. I'm going, "Hello, this isn't the right direction. I can't see the tower anymore." I was so... I'd lost an hour going in the wrong direction.

I had this appalling cramp in my left knee, really bad. It was almost crippling, but I kept going. I had to lie down by the banks of the River Seine near Notre Dame to recover. And it was a hot day, a lot of very nicely dressed Parisians, and there's this gangly young Englishman in his holy pyjamas. On the left knee, there were two holes.

Felicity: So you're wearing like Indian kurta pyjamas?

Shankarji: I had a fleece on, a like a red fleece with a hoodie, but I had my same old white pyjamas, but they had holes in the left knee. And I had this appalling cramp. It was quite debilitating. That's probably another reason why it took me four hours to get to the venue.

I got to the venue four hours later, walking. I rested up as best I could for half an hour by Notre Dame and all that, and then I found the venue, which was, from memory, quite a modern building. It was kind of on the suburbs of the city, like a conference hall, a conference center. I got there in time, and I lay down and slept on the roundabout, on the grounds of the roundabout. I was so tired. Luckily, I didn't get moved on by the Gendarmerie police.

Anyway, the venue opened up, and yogis and the public started to arrive, and the special guest, the Ayatollah. Everyone's all smartly turned out—this is Paris. I'm in my scraggy old clothes, on the back row, trying to keep myself together. I'm listening to the public program, and Shri Mataji speaks very graciously of the Ayatollah and the Shiite Muslims, etc. And she gives the self-realization, the affirmations, and a lot of people get their realization. Shri Mataji's pleased, and then it all ends.

The French yogi, Christian, took me back with the American yogi to the ashram. I think we stayed overnight, and shortly after, a matter of days or maybe the next day, was the Mahakali puja to Shri Mataji in Paris for the Sahaja Yogis. So I'm in there, the puja's kind of starting, yogis all around. I'm in the foyer of the venue.

Felicity: You're still in the same clothes?

Shankarji: I hadn't got it together to buy a nice suit in Paris. Unbelievable. I didn't really care for all that, to be honest.

Felicity: You were kind of an ascetic, weren't you? You weren't involved in material things.

Shankarji: I wasn't bothered with all that. I was conscious that I was looking a bit of a mess, but that wasn't enough to stop me attending the event. So we're in the foyer of the venue, queuing up for a bit of food or something, registering for the puja. I'm in the queue, and I got introduced to Pasquale. "How are you doing?" in his lovely, delightful South London accent. He's a very matter-of-fact, jovial, very buoyant character, and I met him for the first time. He said, "Alright, how you doing?" I said, "Yeah, I've been doing this and this, I've come for the puja." He said, "Alright, right, no problem." So refreshing.

Then we go in and we do the puja. And during the puja talk—it's on Sahaja Amrit, you can watch it—I'm sitting there and first of all, I think in the public program she made a reference to clothes with holes in, that today's fashion of wearing ripped clothes is not good. But in the puja talk, I think she makes a reference to... you'll have to excuse me, anyone watching, if I don't get the wording right, but it was something along the lines of, "You've got to look after yourself. You've got to look after the body, which is the temple, because it reflects the spirit in your heart. You've got to respect it." Of course, I wasn't. And she said, "If you wear clothes with holes in, you get cramps." And it was straight away, I realized she's talking to you. She arguably made a reference to my four hours of utter pain walking through Paris.

Felicity: I mean, that was the incredible thing. You would be there, your small self in amongst hundreds of other people, and if it was needed for your experience or what was happening at the time, that was quite incredible. To be in that huge room with all those people and feel like Mother's speaking to me. You knew she was speaking to you, but other people didn't, or maybe they did if you were there with your holey trousers.

Shankarji: It was a very... the amazing thing about the supreme being—and I like that term, the supreme being, I get it off Terry Gilliam's Time Bandits, it's a brilliant film—is that the supreme being is omnipresent. It's with you all the time. You never forget that. Even in your direst needs of life and you're down on your knees, the Divine is there next to you. All you have to do is reach out or open up, engage, be comforted. The Comforter. It sounds very biblical and Christian what I'm saying, but it's true.

Felicity: It was like that. Shri Mataji could make a reference... you'd be in her presence with other people, and suddenly she would say something to you that would reference something in your past you've never said to her, never talked about. She would make small, short comments that opened up a whole thing for you. And for me in those early years, that was so... that was like, "Oh wow, Mother knows. She knows everything that happened to me." I didn't have to say anything. And she would say it for a reason. She would say it in a way of compassion, or in your case, "Hey, this is important. Yes, you're an ascetic, kind of non-materialistic person, but still, it's important that you show respect to yourself with your clothes and things." And as you said just now, that's how you knew that Mother was divine. She was omnipresent. She knew everything, and it was incredible to actually experience that. And that applies to now, just like you said. That applies to now even though she's physically not there. The Divine is all around us.

Interviewer: It's Psalm 23, "The Lord is my shepherd." It's all in there.

Felicity: She said that to us. I remember in those early years, she said, "Remember the Lord's Prayer. Remember that because it's there to comfort you, for you to remind yourself that the Divine is there."

Shankarji: So, we get back, and then he takes me back to my truck. Then I'm on my own, and I managed to get a farmer to give me a tow, a bump start. I get around Paris, and then I blooming well stall it again in a French village on the way out to Brittany. Then I flagged down an English traveler. He had an old truck as well, I think it might have been a Bedford, an old army one. And I said, "Look mate, I've broken down. Can you give me a tow?" And while I'm engaging with him, I'm telling him I've discovered Sahaja Yoga. "Self-realization, man, this is what you've got to do." I think he was taking it on board, but the important thing was he was towing me to the garage in the village.

At the end of the tow, we take off the tow rope, and I'm saying, "Yeah man, you've got to try out this meditation." He goes, "Yeah, yeah." I said, "Thanks very much for helping." He said, "Have you got any dope?" I said, "No, I've given that up. You don't need dope. You don't need to smoke anymore, you feel good." He had his family with him, and he was a little bit put out I didn't have any dope to give him. I think I gave him some francs for his trouble, and then he went off on his traveling journey. I got my truck fixed and paid for, and then I was on to the farm in Brittany where I parked it up.

Then I've got to get to Roscoff, which was quite some distance further. The farm was near Louargat, near Guingamp, which is kind of central Brittany but a bit out to the west, inland. And then Roscoff ferry was on the north coast of Brittany, and it was the six-hour Brittany Ferries journey back to Millbay Docks, Plymouth, which I'd come into the continent on.

Now I had to get from my farm to the port, so I was hitching. It was a hot summer's day, and I regret it now, I had a bit of a hippie, new age, South American jumper on. But part of me, even then after meeting the Paris yogis, was thinking, "Maybe, Shanky, you should start smartening up a bit now." Anyway, it's getting a bit hot. I was walking down the byways and highways of Brittany to get to Roscoff, and it's getting hot. So I thought, "Bugger it." I took my jumper off—it was a nice jumper, nice color—and I chucked it over the hedge into a field. I felt liberated. I'm casting off my old new age apparel, and I was on the way to Savile Row in London. Not quite.

Felicity: Mother did say to us, when you come in, you need to get rid of your old stuff, especially your clothes, because it carries all your old vibrations. So it was a good decision.

Shankarji: And of course, as you start to get back into mainstream UK life, nobody's going to take any notice of you if you're dressed like a hippie, new ager. Nobody's going to take you seriously, nobody's going to listen to you about the meditation. They'll just dismiss you as some nutter. So there is a reason for that, but it's hard to follow when you're a seeker. Eventually, Sahaja Yoga is very gentle. For me, it's been very gentle; you get eased into it.

Felicity: My understanding is Shri Mataji was pitching it at the middle classes.

Shankarji: Yes, she has actually clearly said it. Unfortunately, the poor people of the world, they're too busy trying to earn money.

Felicity: It's not that she didn't want to welcome everybody, but she said that because first you have to satisfy your shelter and your food and things before you can look at spiritual evolution. And that's just how it is. So it's not so much that she was pitching it to the middle class, but they were the ones who were able to receive it, because the rich are too rich and the poor are too poor, but the middle class are in the middle. They're balanced.

Shankarji: You're right. And it would appear at that time that the majority of the seekers were from middle-class backgrounds, whether it was the UK, America, Europe, or even India. They were from good households. And it may be that the seekers, her children, deliberately took their lives... they had that blessing because they needed to be in a place that they could receive their realization. But it is open to everybody. Mother would accept anybody who had that desire.

I wanted to move on quickly to my first India tour. I've only been on two, well, I have been to India many, many times. My first India tour, 1993.

Felicity: Gosh, you had an intense year, didn't you? A lot happened.

Shankarji: In August now, late summer 1993. Because then I went to Ealing, and I did laboring for Fergie—Derek Ferguson, who's the plasterer.

Felicity: So when you went to Ealing, at this point in time, Shri Mataji is staying in this house in Ealing with her husband, Sir C.P. It was a beautiful, old, kind of Victorian corner house, so it had a decent garden around it. And there was work going on, improvements. And we should just say that the subtle significance of the yogis coming to work on these houses was a collective experience. It was a way for yogis to come and be under the umbrella of the Divine. You were in the house where Shri Mataji was living, even if you didn't see her a lot. You could feel her presence there. So just being in her house, working on things, was like a puja in itself. It was a vibrational experience clearing through you, and so it was a great privilege to be able to go.

Shankarji: Absolutely. At that particular time, Mother wasn't living there. It was a building site, and it was pretty full-on. There was Michele and Joseph, bricklayers come over from Italy. There was Chris Marlow, there was Pat Anslow doing the plumbing, John Watkinson on his ornate plasterwork. They had moved over to Ealing for a period at this point. I remember Shri Mataji visiting when I was there, and it was a building site. She came with Sir C.P., and she came into the entrance hall and she said, "Yes, yes, very good. But you've got to work with more rhythm." And it kind of reminded me of Shiva's drum and the drumbeat, and England being the heart of the universe, the New Jerusalem.

Felicity: You wonder, because Shri Mataji and Sir C.P. could have bought a completely renovated house, but she would consistently buy these derelicts. And she said that to us also, that if you buy a house that needs work doing, you then put vibrations into it as you're working on it. So it's good to understand why this is happening.

Shankarji: Exactly. It was a wreck, that house. I don't know, it might have been squatted in before she bought it up, but it was a dump. But she got the yogis onto it, and her divine attention and the yogis' enlightened attention... when you become a realized soul, you start to create these beautiful things. Although I was just knocking up bags of plaster, you enlighten matter.

Felicity: That's it! You put the vibrations into the matter.

Shankarji: For the Divine. It's like Leonardo da Vinci's paintings or Michelangelo's or Blake's poetry and artwork. These great realized souls and their work has got longevity and vibration, and that's why they're so popular.

Felicity: And the friendships that you make with the yogis... I think Mother even said that by working on these houses, she was building collectivity. We were all coming together to help do something beautiful.

Shankarji: It's the collective, it's your spiritual family. You all share that common connection, that yoga with your creator. So that collectivity of spiritual beings is very precious. You're going back into the fold. The good shepherd has collected the strays of the flock, and you're all moving together in one direction.

The India tour was organized by Shri Mataji and the international collective, but basically it's hosted by the Indian collective. And by God, if you ever want to get anything organized in India, it's the place to do it. I don't know how they do it, but they just pull everything together.

Felicity: When you went on that tour, how many people? Because on my first tour in '82, we had 80 Westerners.

Shankarji: Gosh, I honestly can't remember, but we had a fleet of buses. I think we were pushing up to like 300. So 300 Westerners moving around India, and it wasn't so modernized in those days either. The buses were very rickety, and everybody would be crammed into a room with mattresses. It was very kind of basic travel.

Felicity: But there was a point to that. Mother was trying to make us let go of our attachment to material things, so that in India it gave you a chance to really absorb this sense of spirituality. We had to let go of our conditionings of having a soft bed and sheets and meals on the times that you're used to. It was about detachment.

Shankarji: Just to add in there, returning to India as a realized soul with your Kundalini awakened... your sympathetic nervous system is awakened to forces of negativity, but also divine forces of goodness and nourishment. And your attention becomes enlightened. You look at something with your enlightened attention, and it's called gyana marg. You get glimpses of... when you put your attention that's enlightened on something, whether it's matter or a place or somebody, you can pretty much figure out what it's all about. It's quite a clever yogic state.

Felicity: It's like a perception of depth. When you put your attention on something, you can go into the depth of that, maybe the vibration of that person or that place. It's not just feeling hot and cold or catches or tinglings; it's having a deeper sense of what this place is about or where that person is coming from.

Shankarji: Yeah, India was very different after realization. Before realization, I was really taken in with it all: the colours, the sights, the smells, the caste system. I was very taken in with it. You go back there as a realized soul, you start to see it for what it is. It's not as completely spiritual as what you think it was when you first went there. With your enlightened attention, you can see where human beings have taken the divine and changed it to suit their needs.

Felicity: You've gone beyond the glossy surface, and you see the problems that the country has as well. You can see all sides: the depths and the spirituality, but you also see the things that they're struggling with.

Shankarji: You do. It's a beautiful country, beautiful people, but you do see that. Anyway, it was obviously fantastic to go back as a realized soul, because on that India tour, Shri Mataji organized it that you went to a particular place of particular spiritual importance back through the centuries and the millennia, back to places where Shri Rama would have walked, Shri Krishna would have walked, Shri Mahavira would have walked, Raja Janaka would have walked. And she takes you to these places because they're places of pilgrimage for ordinary people in India, to vibrate and clear the vibrations.

So, 1993, we're in the Bharat Scout Camp in Delhi, very close across the road from the tomb, the shrine of Hazrat Nizamuddin.

Felicity: So tell us who Nizamuddin is.

Shankarji: A Sufi saint, a very, very famous Sufi saint. And pilgrims, lots of Muslims, but even Hindus and people from other religions, transcending religious boundaries. Shri Mataji spoke very highly of the Sufis.

Interviewer: So, Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya is the Dargah, the shrine you went to. He was a Sufi saint who was born in Badaun, a small village in Uttar Pradesh, India, in 1238. So he's a 13th-century Sufi saint.

Shankarji: So I decided to sneak away from the collective and slip over the road to his shrine. As you approach the shrine, the entrance passageway narrows, and either side of you, you've got people selling various things you would buy to offer: flowers, prasad, religious trinkets. And you've got to take your shoes off. So on the side, they've got people minding your shoes.

Of course, still being a bit of a renegade, a rebel, I thought, "No, I'm not going to leave my shoes." I'm going to be clever. I'm going to go and put my shoes over there to one side, which I did, ignoring the shoe minder. I went in, and because you're white, you see, you get approached by the keepers of the shrine that have got a clipboard. They want to collect a donation for the upkeep. I kind of avoided them very quickly and went into the structure. You walk around his tomb, circumnavigate his tomb as the pilgrims were doing. I got in line, and I got to the feet of his tomb and did my namaskar like all the other pilgrims. But then I thought, "No, I'm going to just hang back here." So I sat down in the corner away from the circular throng of pilgrims. I had a shawl on, so I put it over my head, kept a low profile. I sat there and I meditated in the shrine. I prayed to Shri Nizamuddin, "Please give me your blessings. I've come because Shri Mataji advised that we come, and I've come to pay respects to you. Please bless me." It was lovely, quiet, meditational, despite all the hustle and bustle.

Then I make my exit. And of course, I'm looking for my shoes, and they're gone. So I'm thinking, "Oh no." I worked my way back out of the complex, out onto the street. This part of Delhi, I don't know if it's changed now, but there were a lot of Muslim butchers there, trading. They had buffalo heads hung up on hooks. It was a pretty fly-infested, gutsy, gory, bloody place. The street was pretty filthy. And even for me that had been to India seeking and roughing it a bit, I sort of squirmed a bit. I thought, "How am I going to get down this street back to the Sahaja Yogis at the scout camp with no shoes?" There's blood and foul water and mud and flies. I thought, "Oh no, I'm really in trouble."

Then I plucked up courage and I stepped out onto the street. And I floated. I floated all over this awful surface of the road—all the blood and guts and all that. I floated over it. I mean, I didn't hover, and nobody dropped everything they were doing and went, "God, look at that guy hovering." But as I walked, it was like walking on lily pads over a pond. I floated along for like 10, 15, maybe 20 meters, and then I came to a stop right in front of a guy selling sandals, chappals, on a little barrow. Smack. I didn't get a speck of dirt on my feet. And what it was, it was Shri Hazrat Nizamuddin. He'd elevated me. His blessings, he'd elevated me to that safe point where it was clean. I coughed up 12 rupees and bought myself some flip-flops. And I was back with the yogis. I had a great time. I loved it.

Felicity: Oh, what a special memory. What a special memory.
