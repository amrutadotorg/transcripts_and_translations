 (England)
Hey Shankarji, Felicity, and Alex Henshaw. Thank you for joining us this morning on Shri Ganesha's birthday. It's being celebrated as Vasant Panchami as well in India and all over. Alex is joining us from Australia this morning, which is nighttime there. So thank you for the effort, and Felicity, thanks for being instrumental in making this happen.

I want to start with you, Alex, and ask you how and where you were when you got your realisation. What was your first meeting with Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi like?

Well, I'll start with the story of how I came to get my realisation. My mother was listening to a radio program in Sydney, Australia. Shri Mataji had come to Sydney for public programs in 1983 and was interviewed by a quite famous interviewer on the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC). My mother was listening to the program and really felt that what Shri Mataji was saying made so much sense to her.

Then, what really got her interested was when Shri Mataji said, "This is an all-pervading power of God's love. All you need to do is put your hands out and have the pure desire, and you'll feel it." My mother put her hands out, and then Shri Mataji blew into the mic of the radio station. My mother, who was very sensitive, felt like someone was literally blowing on her hands. That really got her interested. She called my father and rallied us around, but unfortunately for me, I was in the middle of my mid-semester exams and study period. I missed the opportunity to see Shri Mataji. By the time I was ready, she had already left for India. So I missed the chance, and I was so disappointed.

But then I came and got my realisation and had a very strong experience. It was so strong that it just blew me away. I was in this bliss bubble for about two weeks, just floating around, feeling like I had all the answers to the problems of the world. I felt this incredible connection with Mother, like I had been with her before and that this was what I was supposed to be doing—to serve her. That was the feeling I had after realisation. It was very strong.

So then I came to the programs every week, sometimes three times a week. I was in the middle of my university degree and busy trying to fit it in. Then I thought, "Well, I'm just going to move into the ashram." My younger brother, Rob, had already moved into the ashram; he was even more keen than I was and moved in within a month. It took me a couple of months, but I eventually moved in too. I spent the first year of my Sahaj life living in an ashram.

In Australia in those days, as Felicity will probably tell you, it was quite regimented. It was like being in the army. We were getting up very early in the morning, 4:30 AM, for meditation at five. The conch would go off, and I was living in the boys' dorm. It was really, really disciplined. We’d have shoe beating first, then meditation for an hour. Then we'd have breakfast together, clean up the place, and go off to uni or work. We'd come home in the evening and have to do foot soaking. Then we'd have our evening meditation together and always sing the Aarti at the end. After that, we'd do our Sahaj jobs.

I was doing all the video recording, making tapes and producing them for all the centers around. We'd get the videotapes sent over, usually from England, and then we'd duplicate them and send them out to the ashrams around Australia. We'd also produce more so people could buy them. That was a really busy time for me. I was in the middle of my degree, so I was studying and working. I didn't have much sleep during that time because it was getting back, doing my study for uni, then doing my Sahaj work, and then the chores around the ashram. It was a really, really busy time.

But we were all joyful. We were all so excited that we'd found the truth. We had this incredible dynamism of going out to programs and giving people realisation. We just wanted to share it with everybody. We were all very excited to get tapes of Mother, and when we heard "Mother's coming," we were just so excited. We'd listen to her talks again and again, play them in meditation, and really imbibe what Mother said. We tried to get to the essence of what it was about. So it was a very intense period, having that sort of background and training in the ashram.

And then every year they had the India tour. I had this marked; I was definitely going to go to India. I was working a part-time job as well, saving up as much money as I could because I just wanted to go over to India and meet Mother. That was my objective at that time.

Then, I managed to graduate. That's another story in itself because I was an average student, and after realisation, I went from average to the top. It was like my whole brain had been reset; I could concentrate and focus, and I could study really effectively. Before that, I was just having fun and doing the usual student stuff, not getting too serious about it. After realisation, it was a transformative effect on my brain. It really made me focused, and I could think critically and very clearly.

When I did my thesis, I got this incredible inspiration after meditation, and it just came to me how I should structure it. I arranged all the information horizontally on the floor in piles for each of the sections. Then I read through each section and started writing. It was like a flow of just inspiration. I managed to finish the whole thing in three weeks. I'd researched for a year, so I had all this information. I don't know if anyone's written a thesis before, but it can be a really daunting thing where you have so much information and you say, "Well, where do I start?" I was at that dilemma point. I remember meditating and just saying, "Mother, please help me to get through this thesis. I really need your guidance and help." And in meditation, that's when it came to me how to lay it out.

I wrote it very quickly, and all these things just worked out. I finished it, presented it, and then walked out, handed it in, and forgot about it. Coming back after the break, the professor came up to me and said, "This is an inspiring piece of work. This is the best thesis I've read in the last 20 years."

Interviewer: Remind us of the time. It's 1983, the summer?

Alex: This is 1983, yeah. In the end, it was just like a miracle for me. I had to take all that information I had synthesized for my thesis and then produce a design from it. The same kind of thing happened. In meditation, I came up with a design; I sort of saw the vision in my mind. I produced the design and had to build a prototype myself. And the same thing happened. Everybody was saying it was an amazing design. I won a design award.

Interviewer: So what were you studying?

Alex: I did industrial design. Part of my thesis was studying the developmental challenges of children with cerebral palsy. I had to study the normal development of a child and then the abnormal development of a child with cerebral palsy. I researched and found all the information about the physical challenges of a child when they have cerebral palsy. The main challenge is they can't develop their normal posture because they're in spasm. Their joints can get dislocated. The whole process was to identify points where I could intervene with, for example, some design furniture or something that would help them.

In the end, what I did for the design is I came up with a standing frame to help them develop standing posture. Normally they don't stand up because they're in spasm, but if you strap them into a frame, it helps develop standing posture, and then the hips can develop properly. For a child that's not standing up, the hips don't cup over properly, so they dislocate very easily. These children often dislocate their hips, and it's tremendous pain because of the spasms. This is because the motor centers of the brain have been damaged, usually in childbirth, due to a lack of oxygen to the brain or some trauma.

So this was my thesis. I had to research, go out to centers where they looked after kids with cerebral palsy. Vibrationally, it was quite heavy; it's not easy to do. I had started this before realisation, and when I got my realisation, I was much more sensitive to it. So it was a bit of a challenge, but in the end, everything worked out. I finished the thesis and did very well. Then the design came from that, and I did very well with that, won an award, and got a job offer.

Literally, the day after I finished university, we had an exhibition, and from that exhibition, I got offered a job straight away. All the other graduates were waiting 12 months for a job; it wasn't an easy time. So I started work, and I told the boss straight away, "Look, after three months, I'll be travelling to England and India." That was my plan. I'd saved up money for that. He said, "No, that's fine. You can work." I was getting paid quite well and saving that money, which I used for travelling.

So I ended up travelling to India on the India tour. That was the first time I saw Mother.

Interviewer: 1984?

Alex: The 1983-84 tour. At the end of '83, start of '84. In those days, they had eight-week tours. I came for the second part of the tour. We arrived in Bordi, and there were marriages happening there. Bordi was before Ganapatipule, so Mother would be in Gujarat, up from Mumbai on the coast. It's not far from the place where she opened the school. This is where she used to have her seminar, by the sea. All the yogis from the first tour turned up, and my brother turned up with malaria. We didn't know he had malaria, but he had a fever and was sweating all the time. He wasn't well at all. I was looking after him, and then he went back to Australia and was rushed to the hospital with malaria.

So we went on this tour, and it was a tour where I could, as they say, have a clear out. I think from the time I arrived, I started getting a cough. Within the first days, I had dysentery, and from there, it was a downhill spiral. I was literally living off rice and yogurt the whole time. I couldn't eat any of the food; every time I tried, it would just irritate my gut, and I'd have another bout of diarrhoea. It was very tough for me, and I lost weight. I didn't have a lot of weight anyway, so I was just like a skeleton, so thin.

I endured the tour for four weeks, and then my plan was to go to England. I met a lot of the English yogis on the tour, and Kingsley Flint, who was living in Brighton at the time and had just got married to Ruth, said to me, "When you come back to England, you must come down to stay with us in Brighton at the ashram." And that's what I did. I went back to Brighton after that. Gradually, I recovered from the dysentery; it went on for a couple of weeks and then slowly got better.

Mother was coming back to London in February. She was arriving at Heathrow airport, and all the yogis from England were gathering there. We all went with flowers. Mother came, and we were all so excited to see her again. We gave her the flowers, and she took all the flowers from everybody. So patient. I was just amazed. So fresh after flying so many hours from Mumbai, probably leaving in the middle of the night. She arrived in London and looked so fresh, full of love, and shining. I was just completely melting. She was accepting everybody's flower, asking, "How are you? How are you?" She was very happy to see everybody at the airport. These are precious moments when you have that chance to be with Mother.

Of course, on the India tour, we had pujas and we had time with Mother. There was a famous talk she gave on the Nira river, near Pandharpur, about Shivaratri. It was amazing, but I remember being so sick. During that talk, I was sitting at the back of the pandal, and the talk was so powerful, I forgot about my body. I was just completely in bliss and floating again. I thought, "Wow, such a powerful, powerful experience." That was probably the highlight for me on the India tour.

After seeing Mother again in London, I was staying in Brighton for a while, and then I moved to London. I was staying in an ashram in Camden with another yogi, and we were thinking of going up to Scotland. Fergie, who was also staying there, was taking us to the station and telling us where to catch a train to Scotland. The phone rang just as we were leaving, and Fergie ran back in to answer it. It was somebody from Brompton Square asking if there were any people who wanted to come and help do some work there. He came out and said, "Do you want to go to Brompton Square, to Mother's house, instead of Scotland today?" And we said, "Sure." We just took our bags back, dropped them off, and went straight over to Brompton Square.

I remember it was quite cool, it was February. Walking from the South Kensington tube station, it was a little chilly. Brompton Square was a Georgian terrace with five floors, including a basement where the servants' quarters and the dining room were. We came down the stairs to the basement level and walked inside. It was so warm going into this room, and the vibrations just hit you. You were in a blissful state immediately. It felt like I was back in India. We sat down in the first room and just meditated, completely blissed out.

Then somebody came down and said to us, "Come up. You're not here to meditate, you're here to do some work." So we had to gather ourselves and go and do the work, which was just moving stuff, moving furniture, cleaning things, and doing general housework.

Interviewer: So Alex, at this point, the house had been finished? Mother was living in the house and the building work was done?

Alex: The building work was done. The renovations had finished, and what was happening was that Mother was preparing it because she wanted to sell the place. There was fine-tuning of the decorations, which is what we were doing—deciding on final finishes and things like that. All the major stuff had been done, like changing some wallpaper and doing some gold leafing. We had people like Antonio, who was doing all the gold leafing. Everything was gold. All these wood carvings, Mother wanted gold on them.

Interviewer: Why gold? Any particular reason that Shri Mataji talked to you about?

Alex: Well, she said the vibrations. Gold is obviously an auspicious metal, and it creates the vibrations. It was like a palace, an Indian Rajasthani palace with all the beautiful carvings. It had different themes in different rooms.

The video we made was with Shri Mataji's direction. It's a very interesting view of the whole place. We showed all the different rooms, and they were very special rooms where Mother had particular ornaments, carpets, furniture, and little special things. Very ornate.

Interviewer: You said, Alex, that while this was being filmed, Shri Mataji was there saying, "Okay, now film this, zoom in here, zoom out there."

Alex: Directing the whole thing. The purpose of the video was to show to clients, to send the video to Saudi Arabia, for example. She was interested in selling it to somebody who would appreciate the decoration. It was something which I can say would be more of a Middle Eastern or Indian sort of flavor, with these elaborate gold work and lovely chandeliers. It was really tastefully done, very elegant and fine. She had a lot of china, sculptures, and paintings. So she was targeting those sorts of buyers at the time.

Interviewer: And were you living in the house at the time?

Alex: Yes. After we did this first work, I'll tell you the story of how it happened. We were moving the furniture in the morning, and we'd finished. Shri Mataji invited us up for tea. It was the first time I'd ever been really close to Mother and had direct interactions with her. We were on the floor, and Mother was sitting on a settee. She had tea and coffee and was asking everyone, "Would you like tea or coffee?" She looked at me and said, "Would you like tea or coffee? No, you better have tea. Your liver's not good. You need more sugar." So she was telling me I should go on a liver diet. That was the first thing.

Then she asked me what I was doing. At the time, my plan was to go to Germany. My sister-in-law had moved to Munich to help start the first ashram there. When I told Mother, "I'm going over to Munich to help start Sahaj there," she just shook her head and said, "No, no, no. Germany is a horrible place, horrible vibrations. So many people died there. It's a very heavy place. You better stay here."

When she said, "stay here," I thought she meant London. But afterwards, the leader at the time, Gavin Brown, came out to me and said, "You must have done something good in a past life. You must have good punyas because Mother's asked you to stay in her house." And I said, "Really? I thought she said stay in London." "No, no, no. She wants you to come and move into the house."

That was a real shock for me because when I had my realisation, I felt that I'd been serving Mother before. I had this connection that I'd been with her, which she confirmed later, that I have served her in many lives. I had this feeling, and here I was, invited to stay with her. My whole day became about serving Mother. It was something that I had a desire for, and Mother obviously fulfilled that desire. It was a very special time and a complete surprise for me. Looking back on it, I realized she was preparing me for what I was going to do later on.

Interviewer: So what was your day like with Shri Mataji, living with her at Brompton Square?

Alex: It was like living in an ashram. The first night I stayed there, I guess because I'd been sick and recovering, I slept in until eight o'clock, which was unheard of for a yogi. I came down, and Mother had been up already. She said to me, "Did you sleep well?" I had such a good sleep; I felt so energized. I said, "Shri Mataji, I had such a good sleep." She said, "That's good. But when you're with me, you need to get up at four o'clock and meditate." I put my ears and said, "Yes, Shri Mataji, I'm sorry I slept in." She said, "No, no, you needed to rest. But tomorrow you need to get up at four."

Shri Mataji would wake up early as well. She was up by four or five, and we'd bring her tea in the morning. I'd make the breakfast. The usual breakfast was a protein diet: egg whites, ham, sometimes Frankfurters, and cheese. No carbs. She was taking that every morning. After that, I’d bring the breakfast, sit down, and she'd be talking about the day. She’d say, "Well, I need to go to buy flowers," or to the hardware shop to buy some wallpaper, or do banking. It was whatever Mother wanted that day. Sometimes we'd go shopping for food, and she'd go Indian shopping in Southall. Every day was different.

Essentially, her husband, C.P. Srivastava, was in London as a diplomat, and she was serving the Maya function of being the diplomat's wife. There was a lot of hosting, a lot of people coming and going. A lot of yogis coming and going, a lot of calls from all over the world. It was like the center of the universe. People were reporting from different countries, people were arriving from India and other places. She would be receiving people, and then there were diplomatic functions, like a tea party for the diplomats' wives. She played so many different roles. She was the diplomat's wife, Mrs. Srivastava doing domestic stuff, and then she was the Adi Shakti. You just saw these roles changing from day to day.

I always had to remind myself she's the goddess, she's the Adi Shakti, because she was very motherly and made you feel very comfortable. Sometimes you could fall into the maya and become more familiar, and you just have to pull yourself back and realize she's the Adi Shakti. But I was always very natural around her. I was never scared or nervous, like some other people who were always very reserved, conscious of making a mistake or protocol. I just had this natural feeling and a sense of what to do and what not to do. I guess it was an innate protocol that was there. She told me the deities are always watching you, to make sure you're not overstepping the boundaries. So that was always a mindful thing.

Interviewer: It's such a different feeling when you're in one of Mother's houses. We talk about the vibrations being strong, but when I went to visit her in Victoria Gardens, I remember walking through that front door and suddenly feeling like I was in the womb again. This incredible thickness and bubble of vibrations all around you, this comforting, soothing, protective energy. It's different from being in a puja.

Alex: The intensity is amazing. The vibration is so strong. It's like being in a deep state of meditation where you're feeling the Kundalini blasting your Sahasrara open—that's how you feel all the time. I didn't have a lot of thoughts. People asked, "Did you ask Mother anything?" And I said, "I didn't have any thoughts in my mind." There was no cognition about what to ask. There were no questions. We were just in this state of bliss and completely in the present moment.

One day, we discovered there was rising damp, a big problem in UK houses. The wall can go moldy, and the wallpaper can peel off. There was a water leakage somewhere. We pressed a damp meter into the walls, and it was really high; the walls were saturated. This went from the ground floor up to the second floor. We were trying to find the leak. Mother said, "It's coming from the basement." So we went down. Mother was walking along with her hands towards the floor, and she said, "It's here. This is where the water's leaking."

Pat Anslow lifted the tile up, dug out the screed, and there was a copper heating pipe underneath. We discovered a split in the pipe, which had been leaking for a long, long time. So she found the leak. He was able to fix that, and then we had to dry the place out with big dehumidifiers and fans. But the damp meter was still very high. Mother said, "No, I'll have to fix this." So she gave the wall vibrations. The meter went up a little bit, as she moved the water from that area of the wall. She did it around the other places, and then the damp meter was showing that all the water had gone. Amazing.

She was always saying, "Check your vibrations. What do you feel on vibrations?" So every day was like introspecting, feeling your vibrations. I cleared out a lot. If somebody walked into the basement to visit, I immediately felt all their catches. I could be on the second floor or in Mother's room, and I'd immediately feel whatever problems the person had. One day, I felt my Agnya just go bang, and she said, "So-and-so has come. Your Agnya is catching. Go clear your Agnya." So every time someone would come, she'd say, "Go and tell them to do this or that." I had to send some yogis away to do a matka treatment because they were quite caught up.

Interviewer: You were the gatekeeper.

Alex: I was the gatekeeper in a sense. Unless Mother had requested them, of course, they would come and see her. But sometimes people would randomly turn up, and you'd have to tell them you can't just turn up. There's a protocol to it.

Then we’d get calls at all different times of the night. The phone would ring—someone calling from America, someone from Australia, someone from the Middle East. It was constant. Someone from India calls up, "My father's had a heart attack." And I said, "Yes, yes." "Can I speak to Shri Mataji?" I said, "No, not at the moment, it's three o'clock in the morning."

Oftentimes, I'd have to take these calls. I'd relay the messages, of course. I’d say, "I've got a call from so-and-so, and their father's having a heart attack." She would give them bandhan and say, "Why are they calling me for these things? They can do it themselves. They have the power. They have all my powers." Sometimes she would be a little bit upset with the yogis for not assuming their powers. She'd say, "Everyone has the powers. Why don't they use them?"

It felt like a cosmic dance. A lot of Sahaj work was happening all over the world, and Mother's attention was on so many things. She was always watching the news, always keeping up to date with what's going on in the world. She'd watch Wimbledon with us; she really enjoyed the tennis and the cricket. We were watching Borg and McEnroe. McEnroe was shouting, "Come on, John!" and she said, "He's a realized soul. He's speaking in the third person." Björn Borg was another realized soul. She said, "Look there, two realized souls playing. The younger one is more impatient, and the older one is very calm and cool." She really enjoyed it.

Every year, her family would come to stay with her. So suddenly Didi and Rommel and their two children came across. I was kind of babysitting at one stage, playing cricket with Anan, Mother's grandson. Then Kalpana came as well with her children. You feel like part of the family, but you have to always maintain that relationship of serving and looking after.

Now, we can watch a bit of the video that Paul Winter produced. He was doing a lot of the video work in the early eighties. Mother said, "Oh, we need to make a film," so he was there to help, with Mother directing.

(Video narration begins)

You can see all the paneling and the gold leaf work. These are beautiful lamps and chandeliers from Venice and Turkey. This is all beautiful gold leaf that Antonio had done. Chinese vases, carved frames. This is a tapestry and some embroidery work. The paneling is all carved, I think from India, and we decorated that with gold leafing. The rugs are all from Kashmir, beautiful silk rugs. There are lots of little touches—figurines and glasswork.

There's a story about this particular carpet. Shri Mataji was walking across it, and every time she walked, the colors would change. The intensity of the color became more. I observed it once and thought maybe I was seeing things. The second time it happened, I was watching her walk across, and the actual carpet changed color. She turned around and said, "Yes, the carpet responds to my vibrations." Amazing.

This is all the balustrade work, with intricate carvings of elephants, swans, and peacocks. So much detail. Mother put silk on top, gold paper. She decorated it all for sale; this was a promotional video. We were behind the doors, pulling them open as the camera came through, hiding behind them. These shots, Mother was directing, "Now, zoom into the vase." This is Mother's bedroom. This wallpaper was all silk she got from India. It was amazing in this room, a very high intensity of vibrations. And above the room, there was a terrace with a rose garden.

Interviewer: I understand she commented about the benefits of wallpaper, that it held vibrations.

Alex: That's correct. Anything that's handmade, and this was specially loomed wallpaper, has incredible vibrations. Anything from natural materials—wood, gold—will retain and emit vibrations once they're vibrated. Everything in Mother's house was natural. There wasn't any plastic anywhere. Glass, crystal, crochet bed covers, all linen, wool, all natural materials. There was an emphasis on handicrafts and handmade things.

A lot of the moldings were made by John Watkinson. He lovingly cast all those, and then Antonio was doing the gold leaf work. There was a lot of labor of love going into this over many years.

One time, Mother said we needed to change the wallpaper. We went to a shop, and there was a sale on. Every time we went to a shop, there was a sale. Mother got all these rolls of wallpaper, and John Watkinson was saying, "I don't know if that's going to be enough." She said, "It'll be fine." When we did the wallpaper, it was exactly the right amount.

Another time, we were redoing a section down the stairs to the lower basement. We worked all night and were really proud of ourselves when we finished. Mother came down, and we thought she'd be pleased. She looked at it and said, "Oh, you finished it." Then she said, "But the wallpaper is the wrong way around." And we looked, and it was wallpaper that could have gone either way. But when Mother said it was the wrong way, then it was the wrong way. So we had to take it all off and change it. She said, "Actually, there's another wallpaper that I wanted to get." So we went to the shop, got that wallpaper, and ended up putting that up, and it looked even better.

Interviewer: Can we have some miracle stories, shopping stories, and laughing stories? There were always moments where Shri Mataji made things so light.

Alex: Sure. Mother went out and bought jackets and suits for everybody who had been helping. There was a group of us, including Pat Anslow and Chris Marlowe. Pat is sort of rounder and shorter, and Chris is very tall. We were in Mother's bedroom, and she said, "I've got some suits for you." She gave one to Pat and one to Chris and said, "Go and try them on."

Chris came down first, and the suit was way too small. The trousers were about 20 centimeters from his ankles. She said, "How is it? How is it?" And being English, he's saying, "Oh, it's fine, Mother. It's fine." Then Pat came over, and his suit was way too big. He was saying the same thing, "Oh, it's fine, Mother." And Mother was just laughing. We were all laughing and laughing. She said, "Now you swap with Chris, Pat." They swapped suits, and they came back, and everything was fitting perfectly. We were just roaring with laughter. She said, "See the English, they're too polite. They'll never say anything!"

At the end of the stair banister in the house, there was a wooden sculpture of a boy playing an instrument. Mother walked past and said, "This isn't correct anatomically." The way they'd sculpted the scapula wasn't quite right. She said, "I need to change that." She started giving vibrations to the sculpture. I was looking down from a few stairs up, and I could see it very clearly. It was like the wood was becoming like plastic, and Mother was carving it with vibrations. The shape of the sculpture was changing. She said, "Do you see that? Do you see that? It's a miracle." She said, "See, the vibrations can change matter. You have to understand that this is the source of everything."

Then she said, "No, no, it's just normal for me. For you, it's a miracle. For me, it's normal." She explained that vibrations can penetrate and change matter at the atomic level. This is why vibrated water is so good for treating problems because it penetrates into the cells.

Another time, Mother said to me, "Bring the car at 10 o'clock. We're going to do some shopping." I was driving, and not being from London, I didn't know the city that well. Mother said, "Don't worry, I'll tell you where to go." So I was just getting directed by her. We went to the East End, parked the car, and walked into a tailor shop. The tailor obviously knew her and said, "Hello, Mrs. Srivastava. What can I do for you today?" She said, "I want to buy a suit for this gentleman." I'd been thinking I needed to buy a suit. I pulled my ears and said, "No, Shri Mataji, let me buy the suit." She said, "No, no, no, I'm your mother. That's what you wanted, you wanted a suit."

A thought came into my mind, "Oh, I need a shirt," and she said, "And a shirt." Then, in my mind, "And a tie." "And a tie." Every time I'd think of something, she would say it. I was about to think about shoes, and in my mind, I said, "Shri Mataji, let me buy my shoes at least," and she didn't say anything. She knew exactly what was going on in your mind. That's why you have to be in thoughtlessness.

Then, there was this other funny story. I drove Mother back from shopping, and we ended up in North Kensington. I don't know how it happened, but somehow I went in the opposite direction, and I was completely lost. Mother said, "Go and ask somebody." They said, "Oh, you're in North Kensington." I came back and told her. She said, "North Kensington? Why are we in North Kensington?" After a while, she said, "Ah, now I know what happened. The deities played a trick on you." She had a diplomatic function to go to that she didn't want to go to. So they made me get lost so she had an excuse. By the time we got back, C.P. had already had to go, and when he came back, he was really upset. She said, "This fellow got completely lost! Can you believe it?"

The next day, I went up to C.P. and said, "Sir, I'm very sorry I got completely lost." And Mother was standing behind him, smiling and going [motions smiling].

Mother said, "I hate these functions. These people are horrible. Horrible vibrations. They're having affairs, taking drugs. They're just awful, immoral people." So there was always this balancing act that Mother was doing.

Another time, Mother said, "Now tomorrow we're going to Southall." So I had this A-to-Z map and was trying to memorize the route because I didn't want to get lost again. On the trip there, Mother was silent. My brain was working hard trying to remember the route, the landmarks, the road names. It seemed to take ages. On the way back, she was telling me about how the English expansionist ego created a big imbalance in the world. I was just totally absorbed in the conversation. We drove back, and it didn't seem to take long at all. We arrived back at Brompton Square.

I just drove, and I didn't know where I was going. I was just driving. Mother paused for a minute and then said to me, "It's interesting. It didn't take very long to come back." I said, "Yes, it didn't take long at all." She said, "I watched you on the way there. You were worried about getting lost, and you were memorizing the route." She narrated my thought patterns. "You saw a church there, you saw the roundabout here." It was like she was reading every thought in my mind. She said, "On the way back, you were completely thoughtless. You were in a blissful state. Your focus was on me. It didn't take any time at all because time is an illusion." Wow. She demonstrated it. She said, "See, your mind creates this idea of time. This is all an illusion." The state of thoughtlessness is timeless. It was very profound.

These experiences gave me a deeper understanding of vibrations. The only way you can survive when you're with Shri Mataji is to be completely surrendered in a witness state.

I was at a public program, and a person in a wheelchair came up. Mother gave them vibrations and healed them. They could stand up and started walking. It was miraculous. We did a tour of England, and I was involved in helping with the filming. One program, I was sitting at the back, and Mother looked at me and said, "The yogis need to give vibrations to the new people." So I moved down to help someone. I started giving this guy vibrations, and all his negativity just jumped on me. I immediately had a splitting headache. I felt like vomiting. And he said, "Oh, I feel amazing!"

I had to sit there in agony with this headache for hours while Mother was seeing people at the end of the program. Finally, we left. I was sitting in the passenger seat in the car, and Mother was behind me. All of a sudden, she leaned forward and went whack on the back of my Agnya. I literally felt stuff drop out of my Agnya, and the headache went. She said, "What have you been doing?" I said I gave vibrations to a new person. She said, "No, no, no. You shouldn't. You're too clean. You'll just absorb it like a sponge."

She took me back and mixed up some ginger and icing sugar, got a spoon, and started putting it into my mouth. The ginger just blew me away. My eyes were watering, my nose was running. She was laughing and said, "See, it's going to work it out."

Another time, she gave me a head rub. She has such strong hands. It felt like her fingers were going into my skull, really rough and strong. Afterwards, my head felt like it didn't have a top. My Sahasrara was completely open. A head massage from the goddess.

Then other times, you get to rub Mother's feet. You're pressing as hard as you can, and she says, "Press harder, press harder." You feel her feet are just rock solid. After a program, we'd have to work on her because she'd taken on all the problems of the audience. She said her body is absorbing all this negativity, working 24/7. She said, "It's like having a crucifixion every day." We have no idea how much pain she was in. She bore everything.

That's why yogis around her really needed to be working on themselves and clearing themselves up, because you don't want to be a burden for her.

I came back to Australia and walked into a hornet's nest of problems. The leader was off, his wife was off, the whole collective was going off in a different tangent. They were all mesmerized. It was a shock to come out of this beautiful cocoon of vibrations into this hellhole of void. You realize that Sahaja Yogis have to be always alert about not going off to the right or the left, to always be in the central path. I was just married, and we started a family fairly quickly. We were living in different ashrams in Sydney, and I was the coordinator.

At one stage, I just felt I had to go and tell Mother, but when I meditated, I had this insight that it wasn't the right time. Obviously, these things are all part of her play, and we just have to witness it and not react to it. She has a plan.

One thing Mother made very clear to me is that the family are not divine. This idea that some people have, that C.P. is an incarnation of Shiva, it's just... Mother told me exactly. One time, C.P. asked me to do some painting in his room because he felt left out. I just went up and did what he asked. When I came down, Shri Mataji said to me, "Why are you doing this work for him?" I said he asked me to. She said, "Who is your guru?" I said, "You are, Shri Mataji." She said, "Why are you doing anything for him? Did I tell you to?" I said no and pulled my ears. She blasted me. She said, "You don't know who he is. You follow him, and you'll be out of Sahaja Yoga." She said, "Go and beat him with shoes every day." So I was shoe beating him. It showed me something. After that, he kept asking me to do little things, and I just had to politely say, "Yes, yes," and then not do it.

It's so important at this point in time. We have to have that innate respect for Mother's family, but at the same time, we have to understand that Shri Mataji comes first. She is the goddess we are worshipping. We shouldn't be elevating the family to anywhere near where Shri Mataji is. I'm shocked that some people are deifying family members.

Interviewer: Can you elaborate more for the students of today who are grappling with a lot of curriculum?

Alex: Well, it's a juggling act. You've got to structure your time well and plan your day so you can always have time for meditation. Morning meditation is best because then you have clarity of mind. You go to uni, you absorb more, you understand more.

I found uni to be vibrationally heavy. When I went back after realisation, it was like a bolt of lightning hit my head. I had to pray to Mother to give me the strength to withstand the onslaught of negativity. A lot of what we're learning is not pure knowledge. Getting into a routine is key. Meditate every day, foot soak every day. That clears you.

I prayed to Mother to help me with my thesis. Writing to Mother is good. Write a letter, put it on the altar, and then just surrender the problem. That's what we have to do with shoe beating as well. Do things regularly. You have to have clarity of mind. When you start studying, start from thoughtlessness. Then, if your mind gets a bit Agnya-ish, you clear out and get back to that thoughtless state. It resets the brain. Self-discipline is very important.

If you put in the time, you'll definitely reap the rewards. I did. I went from an average student to the top student, won an award, and got offered a job straight away. I know that it works. You have to be more focused, and then you'll get the vibration flow. Keep yourself in the center as much as you can.

Interviewer: Fantastic. Thank you very much for that, Alex, and for joining us from Melbourne.

Alex: Thank you. So the next chapter, when we get another moment, is to talk about what happened after, Mother sending me to Hong Kong.
