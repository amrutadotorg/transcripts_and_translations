Interviewer: Jai Shri Mataji, Gopala. That's very nice of you to take time out of your very busy schedule and share with us your glorious times with Shri Mataji. Could you please tell us where it was when you first met Shri Mataji and how it was for you? You've been a seeker for a very long time, possibly since before that. Could you please tell us all about it?

Gopala: Yes. I consciously began seeking at about 14 years old. I think many people think about the purpose of life, and I have no idea how that happened to me. I actually had a very comfortable upbringing with loving parents, which, sadly, is not often the case in America. It was just some sort of strong desire. As I got a little older, by about the next year, I was talking to my dad about it. And he was like, "What?" I wanted something called enlightenment. My parents were very concerned because they thought I was supposed to be a student and get a good career.

I actually wanted to find a guru. I'd read about such things in some of the books on my dad's shelf, and I thought if I found a guru in India, I'd get enlightenment. Anyway, my dad persuaded me, and the agreement was that I would complete my studies and then I could go find a spiritual teacher. So I went on to university, but I'll fast forward to how I found Mother.

In 1976, I was at university and doing my usual, which was meditating either in Charnwood Forest near the university or just sitting under a tree or lying on a branch. This particular evening, I was lying on a branch and saw that the sun was setting, so I thought I'd better head back to my flat. I got down from the tree and started walking. All of a sudden, this tremendous rush occurred up my back and straight out of my head. Now, this was instant, but my memory of it is sort of happening in slow motion. I just went into a state of complete joy, and this lasted for about a day—through the night and the next morning as well.

That was 1976, and at that time, I didn't know the date was special until I met Mother the following year. The date was the 5th of May, 1976. The following year, after I met Mother in '77, I found out that she had given me realization by remote control. I have to admit that I didn't think it was realization because, to me, self-realization meant you have this wonderful experience where you realize you are no longer the body, the mind, or the emotions. But as you know, in Sahaj, when the Kundalini is raised, we call it realization, especially when it comes out through Sahasrara. So that was the term she used.

I met her in '77 through her magical workings and my desire. I was at a friend's house in London at the time. He was also a seeker, and he told me about a magazine called Time Out. He said to me, "Hey Bala, there are lots of gurus in the back of the magazine, save you a trip to India," or some words to that effect. I remember laughing and saying, "Oh, come on. No real guru will advertise in the back of a magazine." It just sounds absurd. Anyway, he went off to work, and I had nothing to do in this tiny room, so I looked at the back of the magazine. Surely enough, there were lots of gurus advertising everything, and they were charging money, some even for a fast-track enlightenment or self-realization.

Then I saw this tiny ad, which I found out later was the first ad Mother had asked them to put out. It simply said, "Self-realization, this is your divine birthright. No money will be taken." And underneath, it said, "Nirmala Devi," and gave the time and place. So on that day, I went to Caxton Hall for the meeting. In fact, in my diary, I still have the note that says "6 p.m. Caxton Hall, Nirmala Devi," which is how I remember a lot of the details because I kept a diary at that time.

Interviewer: Mother used to come wearing mostly white saris with her hair open, a very grand persona, but very unlike the guru that we have in our attention—saffron-clad or something like that. What was it like for you?

Gopala: Yes, I was expecting an enlightened soul with glowing or glittering eyes, a long beard, male, of course, very quiet, who hardly spoke a word unless he gave instructions and who would hit me if I made a mistake, perhaps, or tell me off. So I walked into this hall and there was an Indian lady sitting on the stage in a white sari. On either side of her were some people who, I don't know how to put it politely, but they looked unwell to me. In my opinion, they were also hippies, because I'd met a lot of hippies during my seeking years, and they were all quite nice people. There was a chap standing at the microphone speaking, and he was older than the young people sitting on the stage on either side of the lady.

I sat near the door on the right-hand side because, firstly, it didn't match the image I had in my mind. And I thought, if it's not very good, I can slip out the door at any time. I sat there, and within about 10 minutes, this chap who was speaking kept going on. I think he was trying to introduce us to Mataji, and he was talking about kundalini and chakras, which was all new to me because I had read the Vedas and the Upanishads and a lot of philosophy books. I thought enlightenment would be spontaneous.

The moment I thought of leaving, a signal went to my legs, and I started to get up. Suddenly, Mother spoke and stopped this guy. She said, "Gavin, I'll speak now." She basically interrupted him in mid-sentence, and I remained seated. So then Mataji came up, and I was also surprised to see she was very small compared to him because he had to lower the microphone. It's just all these little things you remember later.

Then she started speaking, and that to me was great because it was as though she was addressing everything I had thought about regarding my seeking and was answering some of my questions. This was all on a mental level, of course, but I thought, "Oh, this seems pretty good." Then at the end, she said something to the effect that you don't have to practice for years or go to a guru; you can have it right now. Part of me was skeptical, but part was really excited, like, "Really? You can have it now?" She asked those who wanted it to stay back. About 10 people left, and about 20 stayed. She asked us to move to the left side of the hall, so I moved with the group and sat in the back row. I just didn't want to be where the action was, so to speak.

Then she came down from the stage with a couple of the people who were accompanying her. She did all the working on people; the yogis, as I call them now, didn't do anything, they just hung around. She was waving her hands at the first person in the front row, and then she looked up and looked at me, sitting in the back row. There were probably about four or five rows. And she said, "He's got it." She turned to the person next to her and said, "He's got it." I thought, "What? I haven't got anything. I'm just sitting here watching you."

Eventually, she came around to my row and came straight up to me. First, she spoke in Hindi, and I thought, "Hey, if this is an enlightened guru, she should know I can't speak Hindi. I can't speak any Indian language." Then she asked in English, "Do you feel it?" I said, "No." Then she put her hand over my head. I was looking up and noticed she was holding her hand really high, just standing in front of me. She again turned to the person next to her and said, "He's got it. He's got it." Then she said, "Do you feel a cool breeze?" Of course, I felt nothing. No breeze—cool, warm, nothing.

The person on my right got all excited and started going, "I feel it! I feel it!" I thought, "Oh, power of suggestion." Then the person on my left started going, waving his hands like, "Whoa, I feel it!" and I thought, "Okay, mass hypnosis." These things can happen. Mother wandered off, and that was it. The meeting was over.

I went back to my flat, and I was kind of disappointed. I thought, "Well, India, here I come." I don't know if it was that night or a night later, but as I was lying in bed, I began to feel this pressure in my chest. I thought, "What in the world is this?" I decided to go out for a walk. In England, it's a bit cold in autumn, so I got my coat on and went out. Then this thought just came completely out of the blue. It said, "That lady caused this, and she will have to cure it." There was no logic to it.

It was a thought, I guess, but it was my own brain saying she caused it and she has to cure it. I remembered that this chap, Gavin, had given me a phone number. In those days, they weren't very organized, so he had ripped a little bit of paper off the edge of a newspaper and written it down. I pulled that out of my coat pocket—thank goodness it was the same coat I was wearing; I probably only had one. I called the number. It was quite late at night, but he answered and told me where they have follow-up meetings. So I took note of that and decided to go.

Interviewer: At this point, you had finished your studies? You were on your way to India, looking for your guru?

Gopala: Yes, I had finished my studies. I'd mailed my degree to my parents. I had done my job, done what they wanted me to do. For all the seekers who came in those days, they know what it's like. It was an intense yearning. Nothing else mattered. They could have brought dancing girls and boxes of chocolate and given you billions of dollars, but this urge was just there to get enlightenment. Nothing could get rid of that.

Interviewer: So you went to the follow-up meeting. When did the penny drop for you that Shri Mataji, this seemingly smallish, ordinary housewife-type Indian lady, is actually the Adi Shakti?

Gopala: Well, I didn't even know she was a housewife. I just knew she was a lady in white who said wonderful things that addressed my thoughts, but nothing in the sense of a cool breeze, which I really had no need or desire for, had occurred. So I went to the follow-up, which was in a place called Gower Street. I went upstairs to a bit of a dingy room and heard people talking.

I walked in through an adjoining door, and Shri Mataji was sitting there on a small sofa. A few of the people who had been on stage with her were there in the room. She greeted me like I was some long-lost son. Like, "Oh, you have come!" I was just drawn in. She said, "Come, come," and told one of the guys to bring a chair for me. They put me on a chair right in front of her, so our knees were almost touching. Now, for someone who always sat in the back row, this was far too close. I'm on a chair, knees almost touching, and I'm totally bewildered, just thrown off. My logical brain couldn't cope with it. And because I was brought up in a society where you're very polite to your elders, I couldn't just say I'm leaving or run away. I just sat there quietly.

Then she told this guy—and I'm laughing because yogis think it's normal, but for somebody who came from a very Westernized upbringing with a logical brain, this was total Alice in Wonderland stuff. She told the guy, "Go bring some water." He comes back with a basin of water, and she says, "Put more salt in it." Next thing I know, I have to take my socks off and plant my feet in this basin of salted water in front of a lady whom I'd only seen on stage.

Then she starts waving her hands on me and around me—what you call "working on people" now. I couldn't think because it was just too much; all my circuits were fused. But I could watch what was going on. She took a lemon, broke off the part that's attached to the tree, and stuck the lemon on my forehead. By this time, what was left of my brain was completely frizzled, and I was just allowing her to do this. I don't know what happened next because I don't have any more memory. It's like all the thoughts were gone. After what seemed like an eternity, I think I was released. I felt a lot better, like a weight was taken off. All that stress from these strange things being done to me had subsided. I don't even remember someone taking the water away or drying my feet with a towel, but my feet were dry and my socks were not on them.

After that, I just left the meeting and went home. I don't know how much time transpired, except that after that, I felt the urge to go to her public programs, which she held twice a week, on Monday and Thursday. She'd come down and work on each person. So I started attending those programs. I realized she was something unique because in her presence, I felt very relaxed, at home. She behaved like the mother I had back in Singapore.

The other thing I must say is that the young people who were around her were strange. I didn't know them, and they would not have been the people I'd have mixed with in the past. They were still dressed and looked hippie-ish. But I felt like I knew them, and they felt like family. Within a few meetings, there was something unique in that connection, which only got stronger and more obvious later on.

Interviewer: So when did you know?

Gopala: That took me a while. About two months after going to the meetings twice a week, I was still not feeling this cool breeze. I just went because I liked being around her, and these new people felt like the seekers I wanted to be with. Shri Mataji was working on some people on stage, and she said to a guy next to her—I remember it like it was yesterday, and this was 47 years ago—she said, "Douglas, go and work on him." Then she said into the mic—nothing is secret in Sahaj—"Douglas is a very simple man, and he's good for intellectuals."

So Douglas comes marching down. And if you had met Douglas in those days, he definitely wasn't the kind of appearance that an aerospace engineer or an intellectual would have wanted working on him. But he came behind me, and I know he was waving his hands because I had long hair back then and I could feel him hitting my hair. All of a sudden, I felt a release in my forehead, like something just went away, and I began to feel the cool breeze. It was astonishing—from nothing to a cool breeze in both hands.

The other interesting thing, which made me realize this lady on the stage was more than just special, was she looked up at me and said, "Ah, do you feel it?" Then she came down from the stage, took me with her to the right-hand side of the room, and sat on a chair. I stood to her right. She put her right hand towards me and asked me to put my right hand towards one of the newcomers sitting there. I felt an amazing cool breeze coming from Mataji—actually, it was a gale-force cool wind. Again, the brain just stops working. And I felt tremendous heat from the guy coming into my right hand. So that was my first practical experience of what she had talked about a couple of months earlier: feeling cool and heat. That was another stage in realizing, okay, she's definitely got these powers and is able to do something unique. But I was still waiting for my realization, for my enlightenment, because Mother kept saying, "You've got your realization," because the Kundalini had come up through Sahasrara.

I went back home and thought, "Alright, I'll try it from this photograph." Back then, they gave us these photostat copies—this weird machine that made copies on a very thin piece of paper. Because it wouldn't stand up, I used a paper clip to clip it to a piece of cardboard I had. I propped it against the wall by a lamp, put my hands out, and felt a cool breeze from the photograph. So I started writing down what I felt, and then the cool breeze went as soon as my brain got engaged. That was an amazing feeling. I just continued going to the follow-up meetings, which were held in Gavin's place, called Brown's Geological Institute. I still have this vivid image of Mother standing on a sofa, pointing at a chart, and explaining what the chakras were to us in this little dark room. Everything we learned was directly from her.

Interviewer: Looking back, I truly envy those that came before me because they had her for longer, with fewer people. It's so important to listen to your stories and put it on record that Shri Mataji did these things, because it's unbelievable for someone like me to think you're sitting right in front of Shri Mataji and she's holding a vibrated lemon on your head. It's incredible.

Gopala: It was just a little under six months after I met her. I was attending all these meetings, including special follow-ups Mother would do at Caxton Hall. Whenever Mother came on stage, all the yogis would do namaste to her and bow their heads. I never did that; I would just be watching her very closely to see what was going on. On this particular day, the same thing happened. Everybody closed their eyes, Mother closed her eyes, and I was watching her.

Then she opened her eyes and looked straight at me. I was sitting near the front this time, in the second row. She looked straight into my eyes, although we were some distance apart, and I was drawn into those eyes. The experience was that I entered those eyes and whizzed back in time. There were galaxies floating past me, and we were going closer and closer to the beginning. I can tell you one thing that happened recently which proved to me this was not an illusion. When I was in London a few years ago—it might have even been last year—the new Webb telescope images were brought out. They showed one of these images of a galaxy, and I had this enormous emotional reaction; my whole being shook with recognition of having passed through that galaxy. Science took 46 years to find it, and Mother took me through it back in early 1978.

When I got to what I can only call the beginning, it was such a multi-dimensional experience. Forget your five senses; there were so many other so-called senses that are impossible to describe. Right before the beginning, there is nothing, absolutely nothing. The great poet Kabir has written about this. It is a marvelous read, especially after a good meditation. It helps you understand why all of this is complete Maya. Before the beginning, where there was nothing, there was a presence. It occupied the body we call Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi. It was a phenomenal, phenomenal experience.

I stayed in this state for three days and three nights. All I know is this happened in Caxton Hall, which is in London, and I was living in Birmingham at the time. On the third day, I heard Mataji's voice saying, "You're useless to me like this." I slowly began to come back to some sort of awareness. Over a period of hours, I became aware of my body and realized I was back in Birmingham. Three days had gone by since the experience in Caxton Hall. I hadn't eaten, drunk, or slept. I have no idea how I got back.

It was very difficult to come out of this state. I recall being told that I needed to spread her teachings and that sitting in that blissful state would not help. I had to be in the world, but not of the world, which Mother spoke about in the early days. At that time, I had no reaction to it. Now, after coming to America and looking back, I feel it was so unfair because I had got the enlightenment—going beyond body, mind, emotions, everything—and it had been taken away from me by the person who had triggered it. But at that time, you were just a good little boy listening to mummy.

So I ventured out of my flat, and I can tell you, everything looked so beautiful. Everything was so alive. It's like you're walking in slow motion and your movement is creating ripples throughout the universe. I moved my little finger and I could just know—it's not a visual thing—that it was happening. Everywhere I gazed was completely indescribable. And there was this infinite love. I used to only love babies and animals, and of course my family. But this love just flowed everywhere, not just to animate objects but to the stones, to the rocks, to everything. And the joy... it felt like it was going to rip my body apart, just bursting everywhere.

Eventually, I knew I had to go back to work, but my desire was to go see Mother at one of her follow-up meetings in London. I was able to drive, although it's a very strange experience where this consciousness is watching "Bala" sitting in his little car, driving to London. It's a strange state to be in, that witness state. I went and sat down right in the front this time; I had to be near her.

Mother came on stage. As she walked up from the left, she turned and looked at me. She said, "Bala had a very special experience," and she gave this super sweet smile at me, then went and sat down and did the program. Afterwards, we all walked up to her car, and she wound down her window and called me to her. She said, "Come to my house." After that, I was staying at her house every weekend, from Friday night after work to Saturday night when I had to go back to Birmingham. Everything I was taught, everything she explained, was in her house during those amazing times.

Interviewer: How did you balance that great experience and being with Mother on the weekends with going back to your normal, everyday life?

Gopala: I said to Mother that I would like to follow her around. Everything else was irrelevant. She refused, very sweetly of course. She said, "No, no. You have to work. You have to look like an ordinary person." She basically told me to go back to my job during the week. My co-workers told me I would have this silly smile on my face all the time. It was a complete illusion; I was watching Bala wandering around. I couldn't get involved in anything. I was supposed to be a quality engineer in an electronics manufacturing facility, and I still remember my boss came in and said, "The line is down! The line is down!" Obviously, I was smiling, and he said, "It's not a laughing matter. This is serious." I said, "It's okay, I'll go and sort it out." Somehow, in those days, things would get sorted out.

I can tell you that after coming to America, it's been very difficult. So I know what yogis go through when you have a job. It somehow seemed easier in England, especially after that experience and being constantly recharged by Shri Mataji. But in America, it's got much, much more difficult.

Interviewer: So if I may ask, what was your first puja experience with Shri Mataji? And where was it?

Gopala: The first puja was in London. I don't remember the exact location; it might have been in the house where we had follow-ups. This puja was before I had the big experience; I just thought it was one of the regular follow-up meetings. Next thing I know, Mother finishes talking and then she's calling people up. She says, "Oh, you can come wash my feet." And I thought, "What?" I slipped behind a table that was on the right-hand side of the room. "Wash my feet?" I had this Hindu-Christian upbringing; I went to a Methodist school all my life. My parents had told me never to touch a human's feet. Period.

So I sat there. All these yogis, maybe five or six, were going forward one at a time, and they spent an awfully long time washing those feet. Suddenly, I hear Mother's voice saying, "Bala, Bala, come." And I'm thinking, "How does she know? She can see me behind this table." She says, "Bala, come," and I thought, "No, I can't." My head was swimming. She says, "Come, come," and then all these yogis are turning and looking at me. The thing was, this is an older person telling me to come. That Asian upbringing, right? You have to obey; you can't look rude.

So I'm dragging myself very slowly forward, shuffling on the ground. In my brain, I'm thinking, "Alright, four or five people have washed the feet. They're definitely clean now, so I don't mind touching them on a hygienic basis." I go up there, someone is pouring water, and I have to wash the feet. I remember thinking, "Wow, these feet are tiny." I'm rubbing them and they're quite cool. Then she says, "Rub here, rub there." After that, I'm allowed to go back, and someone starts drying her feet. I go back behind the table, and I feel completely relaxed. But my brain is thinking, "Is that because the ordeal is over?" But I did feel better when I went home later on. So I guess that was the first puja. And just to let you know, there weren't all these mantras being chanted and whatnot.

I can tell you about the early pujas after my realization. They used to be held in the Temple of All Faiths. We had to be there at 9 a.m. It was a concrete floor, no mats, none of that comfort. Mother told us, "When you come for a puja, you sit in your position, and only if you come up to wash the feet do you leave that position." Those pujas would go on until 5 p.m. I don't mean the puja itself went on that long, but we sat in meditation afterwards for a long time. In those days, Mother used to ask me and one of the first yogis to do the decorating. I used to put Mother's earrings on or a necklace, comb her hair, and put a bindi on her forehead on occasions. We were very close. I used to stay in her house, stay in her room. It was a very, very close relationship.

It's a connection that I've learned in subsequent years is only safe if you're in that state. If you are not in that state, you make mistakes and then the consequences are quite serious. So if you're not in that state, it's best to stay at a distance. And many yogis have learned this. A lot of it is us practicing daily, and it depends on one's intensity. Those of us who came in the early days, we only wanted that. We would do anything—give up friends, family, everything for that. Those who have come later, I have seen over the four and a half-plus decades, have difficulty doing that, and I fully understand.

I used to think, "Why don't these people just jump into it?" Mother made me understand why, firstly by getting me married. I remember telling Mother, "I don't want to get married because yogis do not get married." And she'd say, "Stop being an ascetic. You're a Sahaja Yogi." When you get married and have kids, you have all these very strong ties which do get in the way. It's extremely difficult to lead a life with the family that Shri Mataji has put you in, and the children she has caused to be born to you, and still pursue the meditation fully because you're also trying to provide for your family. Shri Mataji wanted Sahaja Yogis to be role models, in the world and of the world. I think as long as you're behaving as a good, dharmic person, going into meditative states, feeling vibrations, avoiding negative things, and having that blissful state with the divine at least once a day, it's not too bad.

Interviewer: Will you tell us, please, about how the ashram of the North came about? Shri Mataji actually gave you written instructions, didn't she?

Gopala: Right. So in, I think it was 1980 or so, I was working at Rolls Royce Aircraft Engines in Derby. Prior to that, when I was in Birmingham, Mother said to me, "Buy a house with a large living room so you can have meditation programs in there." So with my meager British income, I bought a place out in Tamworth and used to have programs in my house. Actually, after that peak experience, I felt everyone had to have this fantastic experience. So I put an ad out, pretty much identical to Mother's ad, and had people coming to my house to meditate. Sad to say, every one of them had a strong experience and went straight down to London to live there because Mother was there.

The point I was trying to make is, if you want to work on somebody, you don't have to have a big altar or a permanent meditation room. Look at where the yogis meet on Saturdays in London; you just rent a place. It's the vibrations of the yogis and their devotion that create the vibrations there. You can have public meetings anywhere, anytime. It's a living process and it is not bound by boundaries.

So, getting back to the Derby Ashram. In 1980, I got the job at Rolls Royce in Derby. So Mother said to buy an ashram. I was able to buy this five-bedroom house. She told me, "You've got to make it into a pakka ashram," and she gave me all the instructions for the discipline. Then she had the Indian leader, whose name was Rajabai Modi, type up the puja instructions. So I got those, and we used to do a full puja every morning. We had to get up at 4 a.m., go out and shoe beat, and then we would do a full puja. In those days, we did not have the elements for puja, not even with Mother. It was just water, and it worked just as well. We had fantastic vibrations afterwards.

Then we sat in silent meditation, which would have lasted for hours if we didn't set little buzzers to go off to work. The blessings of the divine grace were supreme. Every one of us who lived in the ashram would go up and wash the feet. It was collective. Also in the ashram, everyone had a responsibility. We all took turns cooking, we all took turns washing up. It was marvelous, really like a family. Everyone who lived there was in this state of what we call doubtless awareness. I might have mentioned it before, but we were all young, in our twenties. There was a guy younger than I was, named Sean, who came back after his first day at work and said, "I saw Sean walking inside and going about his job." And that's how all of us were. You would watch this "Bala" wandering around.

Interviewer: Tell us about your most profound miracle experience, please. I mean, the experience you had with the universe and the galaxies was amazing, but on a tangible, human level.

Gopala: I can't call them miracles because I know what occupied Shri Mataji's body. The entity that was occupying that body was attending to a cancer patient who happened to be the wife of Mother's former medical professor. They were in London, and she had terminal cancer. So the professor had come and asked Mother for help. Shri Mataji had sent yogis to work on her, and during one of the weekends I was staying at her house, she said, "Oh, I'm going to see this lady, come with me." So I went with her. She worked on this woman, of course, and we found out later from the husband that she had a spontaneous remission. She got cured. Shri Mataji had told her that she had to practice Sahaja Yoga and meditate to maintain the cure.

There was another lady who was on her deathbed in the hospital, and her family was pleading with Mother to come cure her. Mother told one of the yogis to just give them one of those tiny black-and-white photos to put under her pillow. And lo and behold, she was cured, back to normal.

One of the things that occurred through me was in Birmingham. There was a lady, and our meetings were purely about meditation, nothing about curing or stress reduction. This lady was brought in a wheelchair by her husband, who was not interested in meditation. The following weekend at Mother's house, I told her about this woman, and the husband had said she had multiple sclerosis. Mother told me what to do. At the following meeting, I told the husband to put her at the back of the room. While people were meditating, I stood behind this woman and worked on her as Mother had instructed. I felt things clearing up.

So I thought, I'll ask her, "Can you stand?" She kind of got up gingerly, and her legs were trembling, but she stood and was really excited. I said, "See if you can walk around the chair." She held the chair, a bit wobbly, but she walked around it. After the meeting, her husband came, and I said to her, "Try and stand." She stood up, and her husband looked completely amazed. She wanted to walk. He'd brought the wheelchair, but she held his arm and hobbled out of the room. So there was this cure of multiple sclerosis for a woman who was crippled. Amazing. I have to tell you, though, because of the state we were in at that time, I didn't think it was remarkable. I just thought, "Well, Mother told me to do this, I did it, and it worked."

Interviewer: To conclude, would you please share with us some of the wisdom, the things you'd like to share with the collective?

Gopala: The first thing I would say is, and I'm only saying this because Mother asked me in the early eighties, "Teach them how to meditate." Another comment she made often was, "They really don't have Shraddha." Shraddha is like this surrendering, very emotional, deeply giving everything. The meditation is beyond what I can only term as rituals, and that's not meant to be derogatory because rituals have their place. But if you want to go into meditation, you can't be doing things. Things like working on your chakras and clearing up prepare you to enter meditation. Mother said that in the morning meditation, you don't do those things. You can, of course, put on bandhans and raise your Kundalini because that feels good. And then you just want to focus. If you have thoughts, you can look at Mother's picture, or the middle of her right hand. But try and make the mornings a time where you go into that silence.

The other thing that many yogis have forgotten is that a puja is a place where we want to go deeper, where we want to be propelled into that marvelous state of meditation where you feel the joy of the spirit bubbling through. After the puja, please remain silent. In the old days, Mother said after a puja, we sat silently for hours. We would sit quietly for hours in meditation until Mother told us she had to leave. After the puja, don't feel you have to strum your guitar or sing to show how devoted you are. The devotion is within. Listen to the talks where Mother says, "When you are in meditation, you are one with me," and "When you're in the silence, you are with me." Remember that. Allow yourself an hour of silence afterwards. It's fun to chit-chat, but we have chit-chatted for lifetimes.

We all have to rise together. Mother said Sahaja Yoga is like a plate, and she demonstrated, "When I raise the plate, I have to raise everyone with me, unless some roll and fall off." It's like an elastic band. We can have yogis who move forward with Mother's grace, but the elastic band of the collective pulls you back. So it's in all our interest to encourage our fellow yogis to go into that silence. That's what we had in Derby; we had the silence after the puja. And we did that again in the evenings. We sat silently and meditated. Anytime, anywhere, just go into the silence. That's where we find her, that's where we feel her, and that's where you will enter that state that Kabir beautifully describes in his poem, "Abode of the Beloved."
