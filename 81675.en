"And how come we can never show these recordings later?"

"Oh, Edward, I think that's my fault. I will be applying myself to that in the next couple of weeks."

"It'd be so nice to share."

"Yes. Daniel, we'll pass over to you."

"Thank you. Thank you so much, Edward. That was lovely. Emotional perambulation. It felt like doing a production of the goddess, the way you described going up on the stage. You're so right; we don't have to make it complicated at all because we have the vision of the goddess in our hearts and minds. That was lovely. I really enjoyed that. And in a way, as Antoinette said, the innocence with which you offered the prayers and suggestions reminded me of Douglas.

When we all think about Douglas, our lovely brother who is now on that stage, I can picture him still rummaging with the microphones, setting it up as I first saw him, innocently getting on with it, rolling up his sleeves. Absolutely there, like Ganesha—a Ganesha-like quality—beside the goddess. I think along with the yogis like Kay and Patricia, who are on this call, Antoinette will remember those very early meetings. The first time I attended a meeting was in the Friends Meeting House in Hampstead, London, with the blessing to meet Shri Mataji for the first time.

Douglas was probably one of the first yogis I became aware of because of this aspect of him being there, setting up the mic, rummaging around, setting it all up. And then of course, lovely Kay was there, I believe, and Chaya, Patricia, of course. But I do remember this sort of innocence and gravitas that he had. So that was my first thought of picturing Dougie, as we came to know him.

And then indeed, in honour of that, I had a rummage in my cupboard and I found all of these early cassettes that a lot of the yogis will recognise. That's Douglas's writing. So he was in charge, not only of recording with great devotion and attention all of those early speeches, but managing the reproduction, painstakingly writing the labels and distributing. He was our port of call in those early meetings. We would go to him and get the cassettes. That was my first thought. How amazing is that? When you talk about the ether, that it was this Ganesha-like character there by Shri Mataji, adjusting the microphone and organising. I wonder who he was in his past life.

The second thought... I don't have any big memories. It's more about giving the context and flavour. To speak from what sort of a being the impression was in those early meetings when we were blessed—as you will have remembered and maybe read stories or seen early tapes—when Shri Mataji would, after the realisation, herself come out into the audience and work on every single seeker. Not a single seeker would go until they had had that darshan. Shri Mataji would come one by one, and us yogis would be so-called 'working on them.' Then Shri Mataji would come and say, "Right, what's the chakra? What's catching?" And of course, she knew; she was checking if we knew. So we'd sort of mumble, "Maybe a heart...?" "Oh no, that's you. It’s Vishuddhi." So she was very much teaching us.

Whenever there was a particularly tricky customer, as we seemed to get more of—as I'm sure perhaps Antoinette and Kay and Patricia will attest to—there seemed to be quite a lot more extreme cases in those very early days. Real heavy seekers, false gurus... all the seekers were pouring in. We had really, literally, people shaking and shivering. I remember working on one fella, and I was working behind him, and he was just lifting up his hands like that. I said, "Could you maybe rest your hands on your lap?" He's going, "I can't, I can't!" They'd be rolling around. It was quite a dynamic process working on those seekers. So whenever there was someone really, really heavy, sweating and all this, Shri Mataji would come and she'd always say, "Douglas, could you come?"

He was the go-to for sorting and working on these extreme cases. He'd say, "Right then," and roll up his sleeves, much in the same way he would if he was sorting out the microphones, rummaging around. He would just, "Right, okay, what's going on here?" And he'd be massive. No fear, just open heart, complete dedication and attention, and very acute vibrational sensitivity. I remember Mother telling us, "You see, Douglas doesn't think, so he doesn't catch." That was an interesting lesson on the power of thoughtless awareness. That gives you a flavour of the meetings.

The next memory I have of Douglas was at a marriage ceremony. Maybe I won't mention whose, because it's rather not such a good thing to put attention on that. But it was at a yogi's flat, or rather the luxury flat of the parents of some yogis, and Shri Mataji was there celebrating this marriage. We ended up, all of us, staying the night, unbeknown to that yogi's parents who were on holiday. So many people were there unexpectedly. There was dinner catered for, but in the morning there was no breakfast. And Douglas very sweetly said, "Oh, no problem. I will make croissants for everyone." The most complex thing you could possibly imagine to just whip up for, I don't know how many people, 30, 40, 50... was croissants, because he'd done a Cordon Bleu cookery course. So with no fear, no problem, he just started to make the pastry. We all know how much butter goes into croissants, but it was endless. It was tremendous chaos and mess, but it was just this delightful spontaneity of him making croissants for everyone's breakfast.

This is more of a personal note to end. Maybe some of you will have met my mum and known her. Thanks to my mum, who was a great seeker with a great open heart, my family came to Sahaja Yoga. Sadly, through perhaps damaged chakras and past karmas, how do we know why, she suffered from a serious cancer and died. I was 24, so many years ago. What I will never forget, the great kindness of Douglas, was at the time she was being treated in the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead. Douglas happened to be working there, I believe as a porter, helping in the hospital, bringing medical supplies around. Like an angel, without being asked, without making a fuss, there wasn't a day that went by that my mum was in the hospital that he would not make a point to stop by the ward and just sit beside her bed, hold her hand, and give vibrations. This was at a time when I think there was a bit more fear of, "Oh, I'll get caught up holding a hand of someone who's got cancer." So that just speaks to this huge heart and a wonderful saint.

Of course, it makes me emotional for obvious reasons, but I am tremendously grateful for all the love, for the cassettes, for everything. So thank you, Douglas. God bless you. I know God is already blessing you. Thank you, Caroline, for giving me this opportunity to share a couple of memories. Jai Shri Mataji."

"Thank you for being so personal at the end and giving us such a beautiful insight into his fearlessness and his complete trust in Mother and himself, which is a huge thing for all of us, I think. Beautiful stories. Thank you so much. Shall we go to Kay?"

"Oh, hi. Can you hear me?"

"Yes, very clear, Kay. Thank you."

"Oh, good, it’s working. Hi. I remember the croissants. I think that's kind of my first memory of Douglas, was that weekend. I remember being there, and at that time there were lots of people that were quite damaged. You were there with Mother, this total divinity, and yet at the same time you'd be surrounded by people that were quite weird and strange. And I think I was probably one of them as well; we all had our problems.

I just remember feeling that weekend a bit weird, feeling all sorts of things. And then that morning, coming down, there was Douglas making croissants and coffee. It was all so normal, and it just really did something for me. It really sort of opened my heart. That was my first memory of him.

After that, he would come down to Brighton to stay with us sometimes. He would come with Deviani, quite often to fix our car. We had an old banger of a car that was always breaking down, and so he would turn up to fix it. And it would always be at the right time. I remember one time he came and we decided we'd have a puja. We hadn't had many pujas at that point in Brighton. We might've gone to them in London, but for some reason, we decided we were going to have a puja. But we were all so serious about it. We just thought we would get it wrong. There wasn't a lot of joy; we were just all so worried about getting it right that we were completely missing the point. Just very tense. I suppose all the negativity in us was jumping about.

So we were there getting ready for this puja, all very serious, and then Douglas and Deviani turned up just as we were about to start. They came in and they did everything so differently than the set way that we thought we had to do it. They just came in and just kind of did it. There was no protocol at all, really. They just completely did it from their heart. By the end of it, we all felt so full of bliss and realised that we'd made it into such a serious thing that it didn't need to be. So he would always turn up and kind of put us back on the right track.

Another memory I've got was when Shri Mataji came to Brighton for a public programme. There was a lady there who was very argumentative, and she started becoming worse as the meeting went along. We were all very concerned, "What are we going to do? This is awful." And Douglas just had Mother's shawl. He just took the shawl and went behind everyone, through the chairs, and unknown to this lady, he put Mother's shawl under her chair. And then she just got up and ran out. Again, it was like, we were all thinking and worrying about it, and Douglas just went and put the shawl there and she was gone. That was another memory that's always stuck in my mind.

He came down to Brighton one time because we'd arranged to go to the Friends of the Western Buddhist Order. We were going to go and tell them about Sahaja Yoga and give them realisation. It's lucky that Douglas came because when we got there, they were actually quite... they weren't the easiest people to talk to. They were, again, quite serious about everything. And the man in charge was a very important man. He called himself Raja Deva, the 'King of the Devas.' That was his Buddhist name. But Douglas started calling him Roger Davis. Everyone that came up, he'd say, "Oh, look, this is Roger." So by the end of it, this Raja Deva, he'd just had enough and disappeared. It always makes me laugh.

So he would come down, they would come and stay with us quite often for a while, just while we needed it. And then, as we found our feet and our collective grew and we became stronger, we didn't see so much of him. I think we got a better car as well, so he didn't need to come and fix the car. So that's it, really. That's my memories of Douglas. And likewise, thank you, Douglas."

"Oh, brilliant. Thank you, Kay. Just the love that came from him, the love everybody has for him. These stories are amazing in revealing what it was like at that time and what an extraordinary man he was. How he just embodied what we'd all want to be, to be so light with people and yet so connected. With all humility, just quietly working things out. It's wonderful. Thank you. So much humour, so much joy. Over to you, Fergie."

"I mentioned the first time we had this session that I came across Douglas at Chelsham Road when I wanted to get some talks of Shri Mataji, which he supplied. And then later on, I was wondering to myself, why is nobody recording Shri Mataji like Douglas does? He called them private recordings, but to me, if she's saying something good, it should be recorded. So I picked up from Douglas that it's good to record. I bought myself—in those days the top of the range gadget was a Sony Walkman, but that was a huge amount of money—so the next one down was an AIWA. I bought one of those and started making my own private recordings of Shri Mataji because I picked it up from Douglas that it doesn't have to be an official recording.

The different recordings I got, I've been slowly digitizing them from the cassette and sending them to Amruta. So he encouraged me to do that. Later on, I thought to myself, why not get a video recorder? So I bought a little gadget, which looked like a phone but it was a video camera, and I started doing video recordings of Shri Mataji, which I also sent off.

Later on, we all started working together. Shri Mataji asked me if I would like to come and work on her house at Brompton Square, so I said yes. Then I discovered from Pat that Douglas did a plumbing course. So we stayed in different places. What Douglas used to do, because he was a plumber, we used to go and help him. We had a house, it was an association, so whenever we got properties we used to have them for a minimum of six months, and they always allowed us to stay longer. Douglas used to go in, switch on the gas, and make sure everything was working. Douglas also helped out with different houses Shri Mataji worked on, so we had a little team where we would go around and do things. As well as doing the recordings, he was very good at building work, and we used to work together with Pat, who also used to do plumbing.

It was only recently I discovered... I moved to London back again and I didn't know that my local hospital to go to was the Royal Free. I didn't realise Douglas was there, otherwise I would have popped in and said hi myself.

The other thing is I realised that over the years, many people have been changing Shri Mataji's talks around. So there's a need to preserve those cassettes and take a photograph of each one of them with Douglas's handwriting, because Shri Mataji gave over 500 talks in England. We need to slowly digitize them. I've been encouraging people not to throw their cassettes away, because we need to also keep copies of those cassettes for the future. Not many people know that for Amruta, lots of the recordings have been done as MP3s because it's a smaller file size. If there's any discrepancy or you can't hear anything, you can't do anything with it. So in England, we need to be able to continue Douglas's work.

As well as that, with those recordings, we need to take photocopies of the front and back of the actual cassette, because sometimes what Douglas used to do is add things if the talk wasn't completely full. So there may be some extras on there. I remember one time when somebody bought a cassette, but it was just silent on one side. But it was perfect, because people still got into meditation. What he started is continuing.

I've actually found a photograph, which I'll send next time. This is a photograph of a wedding where Douglas and Deviani were there. And the person who took over from Douglas with video was someone called Nick Clark. Just for the record, most people know, but some people won't know, that Brighton, Shri Mataji says, is the Mooladhara of the UK. So the people doing the video continued that sort of legacy.

He helped me out a lot with many things. I've spoken to UCASI; they said they want to carry on digitizing. But the thing which is missing is the transcriptions, because many people, when they listen to Shri Mataji's talk, they can't hear what she's saying sometimes. We need more UK Sahaja Yogis who understand Shri Mataji's voice because in Sheffield in '85, Shri Mataji said each country should transcribe their own talks. We've got lots of retired people now which we can get involved in that, and in that way more and more people can benefit.

I've got another photo here, Douglas is in this photo. This is a Havan with Shri Mataji, I think 1974 or '75, in Shri Mataji's first house. And the man in the photograph, the pujari, his son has started meditating. And he gave us a room in one of his shops for one year for realisation. So at the moment, there's quite a few people coming back to the collective, which is also good. I think that's it for now."

"Fergie, because the work that Douglas has started, as you brilliantly illustrated, has passed on to others like yourself... but who in the UK, do you know, is organizing the transcription of the tapes? Or is there anybody organizing it?"

"Unofficially, I've been told it's me. Because I approached UCASI when we had the seminar in Wales. I approached them and I said, 'Look, I don't know what you're doing, but what's the official word?' And they said, 'Well, we know that you're doing it.' But I said, 'I know I'm doing it, but is there anybody else who's in charge?'

What I mean is, people think that Amruta has all of Shri Mataji's talks. It doesn't. In 2009, even if you had lots of money and wanted to buy Shri Mataji's talks, there were only 127 videos you could buy. Even though on my computer, I had like a thousand. So people are just individually doing it. Yes, people are sending them to Amruta if they find them, but there's no official body in charge. I've been asked to put a message out saying it is not done and dusted. I've spoken to Antoinette, Gregoire, and different people, and we've managed to get their talks from them, which have some of the missing English ones. People like Patricia Proenza, she gave me some talks. I think Antoinette has got some. People don't know that they've got a gold mine just waiting there to be digitized.

The talks are so fragile. Some of them are over 40 years old, from the early seventies. If you were to put them in a machine, they would be chewed up. So when we collect them, there's somebody who knows how to look after them. Even though people have them, unless they're played regularly, one side starts seeping through to the other."

"I just had a lot of these tapes and I gave them all to Alan Pereira because I was concerned that they would get damaged. I just kept a few for a souvenir, maybe 20 or so in a box by my altar, but I don't play them because I don't have a tape recorder anymore. But I had a really big number and I gave them all away in a big box about four or five years ago."

"So it's gradually working out. It is working out, yes... I was at St. Martin's Lane one evening about nine o'clock, leaving, and someone said, 'Oh, I've just put all my old cassettes in the bin.' I said, 'Please, when you go home, take them out of the bin and I'll come round your house tomorrow.' He had several hundred, this Sahaja Yogi. I went round to his house and I counted them out, and we got maybe five or six which nobody had."

"Good evening, everybody. Sorry I'm late. I couldn't even get onto the Zoom call, but I'm proud of myself that I've made it. The late Kay McHugh."

"So you've all had a little chat about Douglas already?"

"Yes, Dania shared a few memories and the other Kay shared a few memories. And Fergie. It would be lovely if you had something too."

"Yes, because he lived quite near Patricia and I. Patricia, has Patricia contributed? I see she's here with us."

"She says she has no microphone, but Patricia, are you sure you don't have a microphone?"

"She's on a mobile and she says she's sure she doesn't have a microphone... Patricia would remember Douglas coming around to our flat quite often. He was such an innocent person. He had such Ganesha qualities about him, so innocent in his way. And talking about the recordings, we were always happy because once he did the master recordings and started doing copies, he would pop around to our place and we'd always get the first copy off the press, as it were. We were very happy with the fact that he was living in our vicinity and could come around and eat us out of house and home, but bring the tapes.

He was incredibly innocent. He used to ride a motorbike, I think, before he came to Sahaj. I was teaching him to drive a car, which was an interesting experience because I was quite surprised at his lack of traffic knowledge, considering he'd already ridden a motorbike. But he was very funny because he'd stop at the intersections. I'd say, "Good, very good. Stop. And then look." And then he'd just go. He'd say, "Okay, I've stopped. Now I can go." Then he'd say, "Why is that man shaking his fist at me?" And I'm going, "It's because you've just pulled out in front of him." For him, just to stop was what he had to do. "I'm stopping, and now I'm going." So he was very sweet and very innocent.

He was a fitter and turner, I think that was his profession. Not actually a plumber, but he was the closest we had to a plumber. I don't know whether I'm repeating stories now, but when we lived in the Surbiton ashram, Shri Mataji wanted the plumbing checked because there was a lot of leaking. So she sent Douglas down into the basement to check all the leaks. I remember this one incident was very funny because he was down there and Shri Mataji was looking down the hole in the floor. He would pop his head back up like a little gopher and go, "Turn the tap on now!" We'd turn the tap on and then he'd pop back down again. Then he'd come up and say, "Wonderful, only 17 leaks!" Shri Mataji would laugh. Then he would pop his head back down again, and she'd say, "You're a very brave character, Douglas, you're very brave." So yes, he fixed all the leaks and did a bathroom up for us in that ashram. He was undaunted by anything. He was great.

I remember sitting on the front seat of the bus in India with him when he was telling me he'd come that year to get married, no matter what. He was just completely surrendered and excited about getting married, telling me about it on the front seat of a bumpy old Indian bus. That was my first memory of him, actually. I thought how sweet he was then.

I'm sure you've all heard the stories about when David Proll first rang and how sensitive he was to vibrations. He was so incredibly optimistic and cheerful all the time. A great character. And as Fergie was referring to, this great job he did with the recordings... it will take thousands of years for us to appreciate the benefit of people like Mr. Pai, who did the first recordings in India with his huge reel-to-reel tapes he used to take to the programs, which were almost as big as he was. We should be ever grateful for Mr. Pai and for Douglas for their dedication. I'm sure you've probably heard all these stories about Douglas before."

"I think you just alluded to a story that perhaps not everybody has heard, of when David Proll, an early Yogi, had seen the Yoga Today ad and he phoned up and Douglas answered the phone. Maybe you want to tell that one."

"Well, I wasn't present, but I've heard that when David rang up, asking very poshly about coming to the programs, that Douglas had asked him in conversation, "Oh, do you do TM?" And David had said, "How do you know?" Douglas said, "Because my hands are burning." David was so impressed. I think that's probably why David came along, because he was impressed by Douglas's knowledge of what he was into. And you couldn't get people further apart on the spectrum of society than very simple, basic Douglas and very sophisticated David Proll. But who knows how people are drawn to Mother's feet.

It's a pity Patricia hasn't got her mic working."

"Patricia has messaged saying she's got a written short tribute and she will email it... She's going to do it later. She's written it perhaps by hand and it's going to be typed, so it'd be something to look forward to. Okay. I think I'm going to stop the recording."
