My first Sahaja encounter was in Taunton in 1979—late October or November, I'm not sure when. I was practicing TM at the time and had been for two years. The previous year, I had a nervous breakdown and was treated by the National Health. I was living in a house and someone just said, "Oh, there's a meditation meeting going on. Do you want to go?" I said, "Yeah, I'll go with that." I went to a Friends' Meeting House and walked in. At the time, I was just going into my second nervous breakdown. I sat in the meeting, and the energy was charged; the whole room was totally charged.

We did the realization exercise, and I can remember this energy just going straight up the back of my spine and touching my Sahasrara. Then it just calmly went down. I met Russell from Exeter at that meeting, but I can't remember who else was there. I didn't get to another meeting because I ended up in a mental hospital. I think I spent possibly six weeks in there, and when I came out, I had to move towns. I went to my brother's, which is further down in the West Country.

But I kept a photo of Shri Mataji with me. It was one of the blue ones with the mantras on the bottom, which you don't see very often these days. I put it by my bed. I stopped doing TM because I realized it was what was giving me the nervous breakdowns. For the next few years, I never had any contact with Sahaja yogis. I didn't have any numbers or anything; all I had was that photocopy of Shri Mataji. I used to meditate every now and then.

Then one day, somebody walked into the flat. You have to excuse this expression, but these were the words he used. He pointed at Shri Mataji's photo and said, "That woman, they do meetings in Hampstead, in London." I asked him where, and he told me. I thought, "Great!" So I used to go to Hampstead from Minehead, which is a bit of a journey.

It wasn't until years later that it dawned on me... because this man who came in, he was with the Hare Krishnas. It was almost as if he'd been sent down to point the direction. I firmly believe he was. But that's how I got back into Sahaja Yoga. It took about three to four years before I actually made contact again. Because where I live, it's very isolated, and it's a bit of a journey.

Then I came to Bristol and started going to the Bristol meetings, where I met Alan and Christine and a few others. My first meeting where I actually met Shri Mataji in person, I've been told, was in about 1983. I was only just told that today because I don't remember dates too often. It was in a school in London. I was in a minibus, and I think Alan was driving. When we got to the school, I just went in and Chris Greaves gave me a flower, because he asked, "Have you got anything for Shri Mataji?" and I said no.

I went and sat down somewhere, and someone came along and said, "Oh, are you new?" I said, "Yeah." They said, "Oh, you shouldn't really sit here. You should be sitting further back." So I said, "Fine," and moved further back. When I was sitting there, someone else came along and said, "Are you new?" I went, "Yeah, you could say that." They said, "Well, perhaps you should be sitting a bit further forward." So I moved again and eventually ended up on the second row from the front, on the end of the row, right by the aisle that went up through the center of the chairs in the school hall.

I had recognized Shri Mataji within myself before I'd met her in person. As she came in the hall and was walking down, everybody was pushing forwards, as they do, and I was pushed out into the aisle, right in the middle of it. Shri Mataji came down, taking flowers and saying hello to people. She came up to me. Because I'd been pushed, I was just standing there with nowhere to go, right in her way. She came up, and she was this far away from me. I gave her the flower, and she said, "Thank you." I looked into her eyes, and all I could see was beauty.

Shri Mataji went up onto the stage. I can remember a quite funny thing: they'd given her a bowl of chickpeas. She took one and tried to eat it, but they hadn't been cooked; they were solid. I can remember her going, "Oh!" and putting it back. But I was just sitting there, looking at all the flowers and everything, and it was just getting brighter and brighter. It was quite amazing, really, because I'm color blind—blue, yellow, red—but I could start to see all these individual flowers. To me, that was a miracle in itself. I was thinking, "Perhaps this is how other people see the world."

At the end of the program, we left, and I got into the back of the minibus. I was just sitting there as we drove all the way back. It wasn't until we got to Bath—possibly an hour and a half later—that a thought came into my head. All that way, there wasn't one thought. My mind was just silent.
