Jai Shri Mataji. Jai Shri Mataji, Mark. Thank you so much, Mark Williams, for joining us this morning from Melbourne, Australia. Just listening to this talk of Shri Mataji, which is from the year that you got your realization, isn't it? Were you there? Yeah, it was actually my first public program. I remember it. Fabulous. Tell us about your journey. Where were you?

What were you doing? How did you end up at this public program? I think I had been a fairly hardcore seeker from the point of view that, in my mind, I really needed to find God. It was a very ardent journey, and one that I was ready to give up everything for. Very intense. I had done a lot of reading. In fact, it's funny because in those days, every yogi that you’d meet had the same books by Kahlil Gibran; there were these standard books that everyone had. So I had all those. I'd done all that reading. But one of the things that stuck with me was Socrates.

He was saying that it's God's joke on humanity that the senses point outward, but the reality lies inward, and that only one in a million people ever got the joke. How he said it, you had to basically look within. And so I thought, "Look within, look within. Okay, what does that even mean?" Because you don't even know what you're seeking. What am I actually going to find? I'd done a lot of reading and it was very unsatisfying. I'd learned to meditate from a book, and it just... relax your body, do this, do that. Nothing worked. I was very concerned that I had to find God on the one hand, but on the other hand, I didn't want to go to a guru. In those days, of course, you had all those false gurus that everyone knew very well.

They were in the headlines, and they were wrecking a lot of seekers. But it hit a point where it was obvious that you need a teacher, you need someone to kind of guide you. It's a trackless forest, as they say. And so I thought, "All right, I'm going to have to go and do this." So I saw an ad for Sahaja Yoga: free meditation. I thought, "Well, that's a good start. They don't want my money." It was a pretty basic ad, so I thought it's not a slick organization or anything like that. So I thought, "All right, I'll start here and we'll see what happens." I came along and I got my realization at Burwood in Sydney. This was February 11th or 9th, I think, in 1991. There were a lot of crazy people at that program. It was funny because I got my realization, and I really respected what Shri Mataji was saying.

I felt like something resonated with the lady. I couldn't understand too many words also because I'd never even met an Indian person. I didn't understand the accent very well. I knew nothing about anything. But somehow I felt, yeah, she's just common sense. She's just speaking common sense. But I was surrounded by absolute lunacy at the same time at this public program. And so I was really worried about what I was getting into. But I realized that the yogis themselves were actually quite normal and quite nice. It was just the seekers who were coming who were really on the edge, you could say.

So anyway, I got my realization. I felt it. I went home and slept well and woke up the next morning feeling quite fresh. "All right, okay, good." Then I got to the office. I was a photojournalist with The Australian in those days. It's a national paper, kind of like The Times, I guess you could say. A big Rupert Murdoch sort of paper. And I got thrown an assignment for that day, which was to go and actually photograph a very big, what we know now as a false guru. And I, again, not knowing anything but thinking that all gurus somehow had something to offer or whatever, thought, "Okay, great. Bring it on.

I'm going to go do this." So I went. It was a program at a big venue. We got there and everyone was holding hands and chanting and all that. And I was there off to one side. I said to the guy at the end of the program, "Do you guys have Kundalini?" And he was like, "No, no, Kundalini is very dangerous, very dangerous." Because what I was feeling in the program was just all these cool vibrations coming out of my eyes and out of my ears and all the pores in my skin. And I felt fantastic. I attributed it at the time to the experience of whatever this was going on. The guy said, "All right, I'm going to take you out now." So he takes me out behind the stage, and there were all these guys counting piles and piles of money. And that for me was like, "Oh," that just didn't feel right at all. So when we got outside, I was just very bewildered by the whole experience.

Because while I was feeling somehow great myself, I could see this was just a money-making thing. And the guy couldn't answer even basic questions about Kundalini or anything to do with proper spirituality. They were just talking sort of nice things from the Gita. It was like a typical sermon or marketing exercise. I was standing there and a lady that I used to work with came out. She said, "Oh, how was that?" And I said, "That was absolutely terrible. That was the worst $500 I've ever spent." And I was like, "That cost you $500?" She's like, "Yeah." I was like, "Oh, well..." Because I obviously was a journo, I didn't pay anything to be there. Anyway, I kind of deliberately didn't end up doing a great story on it. I just kind of phoned it in, you could say, and they didn't run it, which was my intention, if I'm being honest. I was like, "I don't think these guys deserve any coverage." Anyway, I went to bed that night, and I had the two brochures.

I had Shri Mataji's—I don't know if you guys have this in the UK, but it was a very simple black and white threefold. It had Shri Mataji's classic black and white photo, the chakra chart with the meaning of things, and then how to give realization and how to foot soak. It was all in one thing, very basic but really informative. And then there was this brochure from this guru that was full of gold-encrusted sort of quotes from the Gita and the guru looking lovingly outward. It was just really high production values and so on. And it reminded me—I don't know if you've seen Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade—it's the one where he has to drink from the cup of Christ for eternal life. How pop culture I am, I guess, I'm relating it to Indiana Jones. But here we are at this scene where there are all these gold-encrusted cups, and all of the other villains are drinking from those, and they're all dying. And then Indiana Jones realizes that, no, it has to be the simple cup, because Christ was simple, and he was a carpenter. And I realized this was my Indiana Jones moment.

So I threw the other thing in the bin and I put Shri Mataji's picture up. And I went to sleep. That night I had a dream where I'm in London, of all places. And it's a cobblestone street, it's raining, and it's very eerie and very creepy. There are all these kind of demons in the shadows and things, and I'm lost and confused. And then this lady all in white, Shri Mataji, comes down. I see her and I run up to her, and I'm just like a little kid, like six years old or something, and I hug her legs. Then she puts a hand on my head and she says, "You're my son." And oh, my God. So anyway, I thought, "I don't know who this lady is. I don't know what Sahaja Yoga is.

But you know what? This is it for me. I'm home." I found my home. And so right from that moment, I felt this affinity for Shri Mataji. I just very much respected that she didn't want anything. In those days, there were all these questions, "Oh, it's a cult, it's this, it's that." But I never felt that. I just felt this wonderful connection to Shri Mataji. And right from day one, I was like, "That's it. This is the way." So that's kind of what kicked it off. And so I was very ardent.

In those days, we had the cassettes. I was saying to the yogis, "Can you just tell me who she is? Tell me who she is." And they were like, "No, no, it's up to you. You have to work all these things out for yourself." Because I thought she has to be something really great. Anyway, I was listening to this one talk on Shri Ganesha, which is the only cassette I had. I used to listen to it twice a day on the train. I knew this tape off by heart. But I was very bewildered about what this elephant-headed God had to do with anything. How does it fit in? I'd never even heard of this before.

But I was ready to accept it because I felt that connection with Shri Mataji. At the same time, I was just lost, like, what is it exactly? So I'm meditating that night, meditating in front of the photograph. I was just talking to Shri Mataji, and I just said, "Shri Mataji, who is Shri Ganesha? And what are all these deities? How does it work?" Anyway, I was looking at the photograph, and it started to shimmer. It started to shimmer, and then it became like this holographic 3D image. Shri Mataji was in that blessing pose, and it became 3D. And then all of these different deities started coming out of the photograph that I could see as holograms. There was one that was all fire, which obviously was Agni Devata, and another one, a beautiful, very serene sort of goddess who must have been, say, Shri Mahalakshmi.

I had no context. I didn't know any of this. But all these different deities—there was Shri Hanuman and all these other deities, Lord Shiva—they were all coming out of Shri Mataji. I was looking at the photo, and of course, I was just struck by this. Then she just turned into Shri Ganesha. Like her whole nature changed, and she became Shri Ganesha. And then I realized, "Ah, okay." So I got my answer. Who she is. Very definitive. So yeah, there was no mincing it.

Anyway, one of the challenges that I always had, though, was with the spiritual experience of it. So here we are, we know we're with someone who's very special, and we're on this journey, we're feeling vibrations, everything's good. But how to meditate? Like, what is the state that we're after? I used to go to this ashram all the time, and I didn't know very much, but I was just super keen to learn. I went to this ashram one morning, and we were meditating together. I was sitting next to this guy, and I had my eyes closed, and next thing you know, my attention was just sort of drawn into his body. It was really strange. I could feel all of the nervous system activity in his body and the blood pumping around his veins. I knew his thoughts, I was thinking his thoughts, even.

Then I became like the carpet and the TV and the house and the trees. And all of a sudden, my attention just expanded outward. And it became the entire creation, all in one go. It just expanded out. This rush of bliss in my heart was unbelievable. And then it hit a point where it sort of suspended, like it was hanging. And I knew that this was my moment. I want to be completely one with God. This is all I want. So I was just saying to myself, "Let go, let go," because I kind of recognized that there was a shrinking feeling.

It was my ego somehow. So I thought, I have to get rid of this ego because I want to be in this absolute state. I was just saying, "Let go, let go, let go." And as I was saying this, it just popped. And then in that moment, I just became one. There was nothing. There was no me. There was nothing to feel. I just ceased to exist. I ceased to exist at that moment. But what happened was this rush of bliss.

You know, they say, "Truth, bliss, consciousness." I realized that God is love. I sort of realized this incredible love. That's what it was. I was experiencing the divine in its purest, purest form. And so I'm in this, but it felt like a baby. I felt like a baby in my mother's arms. Complete security, complete surrender, complete love, acceptance. Just like I'd somehow returned to the source of creation. And that was an unbelievable experience. So anyway, sometime later, I actually got to ask Shri Mataji about this.

I just said, "Mother, I had this really lovely experience." And she was saying, "No, that was your attention." And she was explaining that what happened was... and it was too high for me to even grasp at that point... but she was saying that it's like a handkerchief. Attention is like a handkerchief. It can be spread out or it can be focused. It's like putting your finger through a handkerchief and the handkerchief falls around your finger. So your attention can be focused or it can be expanded. So she said, "You were experiencing your attention. That's what you were experiencing." And wow, I'm feeling such good vibrations talking about this. She sort of left the explanation at that, but then in a talk later on, she was saying that attention is God. And that kind of started me on that whole journey of like, "Wow, this is not cups of tea and 'Jai Shri Mataji' and having a nice time. It's God.

You are here to connect with the absolute." So I became really obsessed with all that. I read so much. I read everything I could get my hands on, from Ramana Maharshi to the Dasbodh by Swami Ramdas, to Jnana Deva, the Amrutanubhav. As they were explaining the experiences they were having, I realized, "Oh my God, I had those experiences firsthand." And so what I realized was that what these great saints were talking about was not some mysterious thing that was off a million miles away. It was an everyday experience that's right there, ready, once you go through your Agya and once you're in Sahasrara. Then this is your everyday experience of life. And so that was sort of, I guess, my first experience really with Shri Mataji and my first experience of Sahaja Yoga in the purest sense. There was an incident at a railway station around this time, or was it before that? Oh yeah. This was just as I was starting to get fascinated enough to move into an ashram.

I was still living at home with my folks, and they were out in the boondocks in a very bad area, actually. So it wasn't an area you'd go around at night. Unfortunately for me, I was on a late shift from work, and I had to travel on a train at about 11 o'clock at night. I ended up at this railway station, Blacktown, which is a heavy area. Not so much anymore, but in those days, it really was. We're talking 1991. I'm walking up the platform, and I can see one taxi. I thought, "Right, I'm going for that taxi." And then when I looked at the top of the platform, there was a kind of gang of hoodlums, I guess you'd call them, at the top of the steps. And I thought, "Oh God, I've got to get past them, but I want to get that taxi." So I thought, what if I just kind of run as if I'm getting the taxi? Just don't pay any attention to them, and then I'll be fine.

So I kind of ran up the steps, and one of them came in front of me, obviously deliberately. I hit him with my shoulder, and I thought, "Well, I'm just going to keep going. I'm just going to pretend it didn't happen and just keep going." But they started following me, running sort of down the landing. And I thought, "I'm not going to make it to the taxi. I'm kind of done for." And then I remembered all these talks—as I said, I'd listened to a few talks by then on the old cassettes—and it was like, "Well, leave it to God, leave it to Shri Mataji, leave it to the divine." So I thought, "Well, this is that moment." So I stopped, and before I turned around, I just said, "Shri Mataji, I leave this to you." At that point, I hadn't had any, apart from a couple of those experiences, I was still trying to understand who Shri Mataji was, really. Even though I'd had a couple of really nice experiences, I was still coming to terms with it all. But I thought, "Well, this is it. It's now or never." I just left it to Shri Mataji. I turned around, and they all stopped. We just looked at each other from a couple of meters away.

I was kind of ready for fight or flight. I was quite tense. But you were alone, and there was a gang of them. There was a gang, maybe six or seven guys. Anyway, they were just standing there, and I was looking at them, and they were looking at me. They didn't say a word. I didn't say a word. I was just looking at each of them. And then, after maybe 15 seconds, 20 seconds, they just, one by one, turned around and walked away. And then I just went and got the taxi home.

That was the moment when I thought, "Well, something happened there. Because they were ready to do whatever. Something happened." Something happened in their brains. Shri Mataji had done something in their minds to turn them around and send them the other way. That's when I was like, "Okay, again, I don't know what's going on, but I just thank you that I'm part of this, that somehow I've got this incredible blessing that I'm just with her through all this." So that, in a way, was my first, you could really say, miracle. Oh, that's absolutely mind-blowing, isn't it? That the divine works in such subtle, mysterious ways. Here you are, a photojournalist, ready to be manhandled, beaten up, or whatever they could have done. And you surrender and think, "Shri Mataji, I leave it to you, although I don't understand you." And she transforms these hooligans. I remember Shri Mataji came to Sydney once, and how she understands what you're thinking.

She was saying something... and apologies to Russians in the audience, but I was living in Dubai. This was fast-forwarding quite a few years. I dealt with a lot of Russians, and I was having a lot of difficulty with them. Then Shri Mataji was there talking about how great the Russians were. Something in me was like, "No, no, that's just not my experience." And then she stopped and she said, "All right, half of them are good." And then I realized, she read my thoughts. There was no other explanation that she would stop halfway and say, "All right, half of them are good." Then there was another experience, very similar. In Dubai, Shri Mataji used to come visit quite a lot, for a few days here and there. This would be the mid-2000s, maybe 2007 or '08. Anyway, there was a lot of chaos in that collective.

Very new yogis, a lot of pushy, I guess, wealthy people who didn't know anything about Sahaja Yoga, but because they had money, they somehow felt they could kind of push in. It was a bizarre place for that. We were just feeling that the vibe was really off at that time. Everyone was trying to get Shri Mataji's darshan, and you could see Shri Mataji was really uncomfortable with it as well. She even said, "I just want the yogis." I did hear that much. So we just decided, "All right, we'll just keep our distance," because it was so heartbreaking to see all this. So we just kept our distance. She was going to the airport to leave, and I was just feeling really bad about it because it was chaos, and there were lots of stupid—I would just say it straight out—stupid people around. I thought, "Do I even go?" And then I thought, "No, you have to see Shri Mataji off. You have to pay your respects." So we went to the hotel and we were just standing there.

Her car had come around, and then she came out. I just started crying because it was just heartbreaking. She came to the car, and just in my heart, I was like, "Shri Mataji, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that you had to feel this in your life. But I'm also sorry that I'm feeling like this. I'm just feeling bad about everything. I'm so sorry." Anyway, she stopped by the car. You know how she would just go around like this for people? She stopped and she looked straight at me. I was at some distance away, and she winked.

Then she got in the car and I just melted. Because I realized, "Oh my God, it's just a game. It's all just a play." She just... it's just a game. It was a time, wasn't it, Mark? In 2005, '06 onwards, she wasn't talking very much. She was receding into herself. She wanted us to grow, wasn't it? So it's so sweet that she'd wink at you. She winked. And the funny thing was that, as I said, the emotion of it all was very, very strong for me, because you just want to experience and be with Shri Mataji and really have those moments.

But at the same time, there's all this... people jostling and getting in the way of that. I remember I was there, I videoed an interview with Shri Mataji, and I was pulling the equipment down. This was on the same tour. I hadn't said a word to Shri Mataji, but you know how it is where she's sitting there, there are hundreds of people all around her, and then all of a sudden everyone's told to go. And then it's just Shri Mataji sitting there all alone. I'm still packing equipment away. I looked at Shri Mataji and she waved me over. So I just went to her feet, I just namaskar'd and I was kneeling at her feet. She just said, "You love me very much." I said, "Yes, Shri Mataji, I do." And then she said, "Okay, you should maybe finish packing up." So I went and I finished packing up, but it was just a moment. It was almost like a thing that said, "It's okay." And this was also really bizarre, and I think it shows that we yogis are playing a role that's different perhaps to what we think.

During that whole chaotic experience, which was very heavy politically with all these people around, we were quite heartbroken. Anyway, I had a dream of Shri Mataji that night. And she said, "There was so much pain in the Middle East"—because this was Dubai—"so much pain. I couldn't absorb it. So I had to put it on to someone, and I put it on you people." She said, "That's why I've had to put you through this." And that was so interesting because you realize, "Wow, we're basically extensions of her being." She was utilizing us in a way that was really unexpected. It really made me realize that the role we're playing in all of this as souls who are connected to the divine is perhaps quite different to what we imagine as well. Yes, we have very limited understanding as human beings. We do touch on that consciousness, on the experiences that Shri Mataji bestows upon us, but the words are not quite adequate enough to describe it, isn't it? So this is 2007 in Dubai. And then after that, she winked at you.

Yeah, it was so sweet. But it really reminded me that she's like the puppeteer; everything's just a puppet show. It was just a lesson, I guess. We had another experience like that in terms of lessons. There was one time when I came up as a junior photojournalist, one of my best mates was a junior reporter. We were quite chummy, and he went off to become the press secretary in the premier's office. Shri Mataji was coming with Sir CP. Sir CP had written that book, the Lal Bahadur Shastri book, and they were coming to Australia. It was at the launch of the book. So anyway, we wanted to do a launch, get some dignitaries there, have a hall, and do everything.

Because I knew this guy and he was press secretary for the premier at that time, I thought, "This is what I'm going to do. I'm just going to hit him up." It was actually the opposition leader, because we all felt that he was one of these guys who was worldly. He knew about world affairs, he'd married an Asian lady, and he seemed to have this kind of veneer about him that was like, "Oh, you know, he'd be good for this." So I approached the guy and said, "Hey." I kind of thought, "How do I pitch this?" because there was still a lot of the cultish stuff going on in those days. So when I approached him, I said, "Look, I've got a very dear family friend." I thought there's no other way to pitch this. "She's coming, and her husband's a very elite diplomat. He's written this book," and I gave him the top-line story. He was like, "Wow, that sounds really interesting. I reckon we'd love to do that. No problem at all." Done. So I spoke to the leader at that time.

I was young, you know, in my late twenties. I told the leader, "Look, I've organized this," and he goes, "Well, let me talk to them." I was like, "Oh, well, I've kind of told them a little bit of a fib. I've packaged it in a way which is more of a personal favor, so just leave it to me." He said, "No, no, no, I must talk to them." I was like, "No, no, no, you have to just follow me on this. I'm sorry, but I can't put you in touch with him at the moment. Just let me handle it." "No, no, no, I want to talk to them." Anyway, I said, "No, I'm not doing that." So this leader, he rang the opposition leader's office from the "Life Eternal Trust" and blah, blah, blah, and "Shri Mataji" and "Sahaja Yoga" and all this sort of stuff. He just completely botched it. I got a call from my mate who was like, "What's going on? What is this?" I'm going, "No, no, no, it's a perfectly normal organization of people. There's nothing..." But he was like, "No, it's this, it's that." I'm trying to put out this fire that's just begun. And he's like, "Look, I've put myself out front for you.

I look bad. Don't ever talk to me again." That's it, finished like that. He ended our relationship. We were good friends. So anyway, that leader got in front of the collective and was telling them, "Oh, Mark was lying. He'd never had it organized. It was a lie." I thought, "Well, here I am. I'm completely skewered now." I've lost my professional friendship on one side, and I've got half the yogis thinking I'm crackers on the other side. What am I going to do? I'm so upset.

I went to bed that night and thought, "That's it. I don't know what to do." And Shri Mataji was coming, by the way; this was only maybe ten days out from Shri Mataji coming. Anyway, I get a call at 6 a.m., which never happens. It's my boss. He's like, "One of the guys who was going to go traveling with the premier has fallen ill. Would you be able to go? They're going to the drought. They've got a private plane. Would you be able to go?" I said, "Yeah, I'm ready to go." So I drove out to the airport with my equipment. I was the last guy there, the plane's on the runway.

I jump in, and there's only one seat, and it's directly opposite the premier—the deputy premier, who was the head of the National Party. So I sit down opposite him. He's just fidgeting around and kind of looking out the window. There were no other distractions in those days. If you didn't have a book or didn't want to play Snake on your Nokia phone, there was nothing else to do. He's fidgeting around, and I had Gandhi's autobiography. There's a bit of protocol, so you're not really supposed to engage them unless they engage you, and I certainly didn't want to break that protocol. So I got my book out, and he looks at the book and says, "What's this book about then? Tell me about this book." He just wanted to have a chat. Well, I told him.

And then I said, "Look, don't take it from me. There's a lady coming up next week." And he's like, "Done." He says, "I'll get you Parliament House. We'll organize all the media for you. We'll just do everything. All you've got to do is just show up." I'm done. I was like, "Oh my God, that was just like a miracle." Then we were talking, and it turns out he lived down the road. I was living in an ashram in Coogee in those days, and he used to live down the road. We had this house dog at the ashram, and he had an identical dog. So he's talking about his dog, I'm talking about my dog, we're talking about Coogee, and we're just having a laugh. He was such a sweet, sweet man.

We show up, we do the event, and it's all booked and done. Then Shri Mataji comes the following week, and Sir CP is like, "Well, we should go and do this. Mark, you need to accompany me because obviously you've organized it." We get to Parliament House and we go up to introduce Sir CP to the deputy premier. We come up to the floor, and I see right down the end of the corridor, the deputy premier standing in his doorway, and he's bouncing a tennis ball. This is Australia, right? He shouts straight down the corridor, "Mark Williams, the Mayor of Coogee! Come here, big fella!" And I kid you not, he lifts me off the ground in a bear hug. So I'm like, "Oh, Mr. Premier, this is Sir CP Shrivastava." We went into the office and sat down, and the two of them met, and Sir CP was quite happy. Everything was quite well done.

We went down and they gave the talk. Everything was great. Shri Mataji was sitting there, looking at me from the side of the stage. You know when you can feel someone watching, especially Shri Mataji? I looked at Shri Mataji and she would look away like this. It happened two or three times. Afterwards, I got to meet Shri Mataji and I said, "Shri Mataji, what happened? Why was it so hard to organize? My whole reputation was on the line. It was heavy." And Shri Mataji said, "No, I had to increase your faith.

That was just about faith. I had to increase your faith." So the story continues. We ended up going to this restaurant because Shri Mataji was coming. I was on a liver diet, which I'd never really seriously done before, but I thought, "No, Shri Mataji is coming, I'm going to be serious." So we go to this Italian restaurant on the waterfront, it's beautiful. Everyone orders, and Shri Mataji orders lasagna. I just ordered some basic vegetarian penne because of the liver. But Shri Mataji orders lasagna. The yogis are like, "Oh, lasagna!" They all order lasagna. As the waitress is coming away, Shri Mataji says, "Excuse me, is it beef?" They said, "Yes, ma'am, it's beef." And she says, "No, no, I'll change my order because my teeth are hurting. I don't want to have the beef." She ordered something else.

She said, "But you people keep your order." And everyone's like, "Oh my God, we're about to eat beef in front of Shri Mataji, what are we doing?" Another test, right? Another test of, hey, they're just conventions that you adhere to as closely as you can, but you don't become fanatical about it. During the lunch, Shri Mataji's talking, she's saying some wild things as she always did. Like, "The Pope's got AIDS." This was John Paul II, I think. "The Pope's got AIDS." And Sir CP is like, "How do you know?" And she says, "I know." We're all just like, "Oh my God, the Pope's got AIDS." So it was one of these conversations which was really amazing. Anyway, we finish the food, and then dessert. I said to the guy next to me, "I'm on a liver diet. What should I do?" Shri Mataji heard and she said, "Waiter, two ice creams for him too." So he brings two bowls of ice cream out, not one, but two. I finished those two, and then Shri Mataji hands me her bowl of ice cream. She said, "You have to have it because it's prasad." After we were done with the lunch, I looked at my watch.

It was four o'clock in the afternoon. I realized, "Oh my God, I'm going to get absolutely murdered. I've got to get back to the office." I'd been gone all day, and they only gave me an opening of a couple of hours. So I jumped in a cab, went screaming back to the office, and I thought, "What am I going to say?" I show up at the office. It's completely empty. This is a newspaper at four o'clock in the afternoon. I walk in the front door—impossible. There's not a soul there. I walked up to the security guard and said, "What's going on?" He said, "Oh, the computer systems crashed about 90 minutes ago. They can't fix it.

So there's no paper tomorrow. Everyone's gone." Amazing, right? So I'm just like, "Oh my God. She turned the newspaper off for the day." I went upstairs to the washroom and was just washing my face. I looked at myself and I didn't recognize myself because I looked completely different. She had cleared me out through the whole lunch. I realized that she was... everything was just a play. She's cleansing, guiding you, and teaching you all at the same time in all these really subtle ways. And every word, what I realized was that everything she said had a kind of... not a double meaning, but you had to look for the meaning in things. To hammer that point home, I remember being with her one time and a lady came in front of Shri Mataji with her husband right next to her.

Shri Mataji asked, "Oh, where's your husband? Are you married?" And she's like, "Yes, this is my husband here." But it turned out that they were having lots and lots of marital problems and that he was seeing another woman. She obviously picked up on it, and that was like the divine hint that something wasn't right there. So yeah, I had that crazy experience with the launch. There was another time we were in Cabella for a Ganesh Puja, I think in 1999 or 2000. This was a huge test for me because again, Australian collective, lots of chaos. There was a leader there at that time who was really hard work, and we just got swept up in all of the chaos that was going on. Shri Mataji came to the Puja, and afterwards she had gifts for the Australians. She put them all out, and I grabbed a tie. Then Shri Mataji said, "Oh, come and see me tomorrow after the weddings." I thought, "Oh, okay, this should be good." Because there was such chaos, I thought, "That's it, I'm going to tell Shri Mataji." In my mind, I was really reacting to a lot of the stuff that was going on.

Anyway, the next day, weddings happened. After the weddings, I jumped in the van, and the guy's like, "You shouldn't be in the van. What are you doing in the van?" I'm going, "Well, you just shush and drive." I was not having it from anyone. I was feeling really ready for a fight with anyone who was ready to take me on, because the tensions in the collective had really blown up. Shri Mataji wasn't happy. She was telling Australians, "Go and foot soak. You're all right-sided." She was really not that impressed with us in those days. Anyway, I got up to the castle, standing there out the front. The car comes, and some of the yogis look at me like, "What's he doing here? Who does he think he is to come up here?" I was feeling really tense.

Shri Mataji gets out of the car and she's sort of namaskar-ing to everybody, and then she went straight past me. Something in me was like, "Oh, okay." I was already feeling quite intense. So I immediately felt like, "Oh, okay." No problem, I tried to brush it off. Palanquin up to the top of the steps. She gets out, and she's just going in, and she looks at me and goes, "What are you doing here?" I just went white. I thought maybe I misheard everything. Maybe I shouldn't be here. Maybe these people are right. I didn't know what to say; I was stammering for the words. And then Shri Mataji said, "Oh, that's right.

I called you, didn't I?" I said, "Yes, yes, Shri Mataji." Like, "Oh, thank God." So then all of these difficult people were standing there, and Shri Mataji gives me her handbag. She puts my arm in hers, so I'm walking with Shri Mataji's hand on my arm, carrying her handbag. In my mind, I'm like, "Wow, oh my God, I'm with Shri Mataji and she's touching me on the arm. This is fantastic." I was really relishing the moment. Then she stopped and turned to bid farewell to everybody. The look on their faces was like, "What is he... what's going on? Who is this guy?" And I was just like, "Yes! I'm with Shri Mataji!" We went into the room and sat down, and she said, "You know, 60% of these people are not Sahaja Yogis. Your relationship is with me, not with them. Sahaja Yoga is only one of my aspects." So she said, "Don't get affected by these things." I said, "Shri Mataji, I think I've got ego." Because I was seeing my own reaction at that point.

She said, "No." I said, "No, no, Shri Mataji, I think I've got ego." And she said, "Do you think you've got ego, or do you know you've got ego?" I said, "I know. I know I've got ego." And she said, "Very good. I didn't want to say it. It's good that you saw it for yourself. But don't worry, all those Australians have got ego down there." So we had bought this apartment, so I had the title deed. It was a big deal. I thought, "I'm going to get Shri Mataji, if I can, to bless the title deed or something." So I put it on the floor next to me and promptly forgot about it. I thought, "Well, I'm going to meditate. I'm with Shri Mataji, she's meditating, so I'm going to meditate." I was just sitting there at her feet, and then she went into the blessing pose like this. She sat there for five or six minutes like that, just in silence.

Then she brought her hands back down again. I didn't know, "Do I close my eyes? Do I keep my eyes open?" So I was just staring at her feet. Every now and again, I would just look up. I'm just meditating at Shri Mataji's feet, and she's meditating. Then I see her looking me up and down like this. After two or three more minutes, she said, "You'll be all right." I had this strange feeling that she was fixing something in my future. I just felt it. Then she looked at the title deed and said, "Oh, what's that?" I said, "Oh, Shri Mataji, it's a title deed, I bought an apartment." I was super happy. She said, "Sell it." I said, "I just bought it." She said, "Sell it.

You don't need the headache." And I was like, "Oh, okay." Then she named the Kingsgrove ashram. She said, "Oh, Kingsgrove ashram was a blessing for you. You should stay there." Okay, we'll stay. No problem. So I sold the apartment, broke even. I'm the only person that's invested in Australian property and just broken even, but that's okay. As I said before, I went to say to Shri Mataji about how all the chaotic things were going on, but it was all gone. Then she said, "So, is there anything else?" I said, "Oh, Shri Mataji, I just want to be with you forever. That's all. I don't want anything else in this life but just to be with you for all eternity." Then she put her hands up in blessing and she said, "I bless you for that." And then I just namaskar'd to her and left.

It was such a beautiful, very, very special moment. I had another one because we traveled to Asia with Shri Mataji as well on one of the tours. They told me she was going shopping one day. I was staying in the ashram there, and I just made my way down to the hotel. I came up, there was no one there. So I thought, "Oh, fantastic. I'll just sit and meditate. I've got the place to myself." So I was sitting quietly meditating. No one is there. I just walked in, the doors were open.

Then I hear, "Mark," and it was Shri Mataji's voice. I was like, "Yes, yes, Shri Mataji." She said, "Come in, come in." I went in, and Shri Mataji was in her bedroom, and she was just reading the paper. She said, "Come sit down. I'll teach you how to meditate." I thought, "Oh, I need this." She was saying, "Have you heard of noise-canceling headphones?" This was in the '90s. We didn't have that tech in those days. I said, "Yes, Shri Mataji." She said, "Well, that's kind of how meditation works. The sound is waves on the outside. You have the cups on your ears, and there's a little microphone that picks up that sound and flips the polarity of it so they cancel out. So what happens is that in the cup in the ear, the waves are actively banging into each other and canceling out." She said, "That's noise-canceling headphones. That's how your attention works.

Your thoughts rise and fall as a wave. Your attention is the equal opposite wave of that. So when they hit each other, they cancel. All you do is you just watch your thoughts. You turn your attention back on your thoughts. They immediately just cancel out, and you can be silent just by doing that. All you've got to do is watch your thoughts. They automatically cancel in the act of doing it." It's like nullifying, isn't it? Minus one plus one is zero. The frequency of the attention matching the frequency of the thought, and then it's null and void.

Just in that witness state. Exactly. So she was saying that you just do that. Just turn your attention back on your thoughts, and they automatically dissolve. She said, "The beauty of it is that you can meditate when you're driving the car, when you're at work, when you're washing the dishes. Whatever you're doing, you can just turn your attention back and be thoughtless." And she said, "The aim is to be as thoughtless as you can, as long as you can, as much as you can. So do it now." I said, "Oh, I'm not sure it's a good test because I'm with you. I'm so overwhelmed with being with you." So then she said, "Okay, do it when you get home at the ashram. Go to the ashram and then come back and tell me tomorrow how it is." I went on the tram on the way home, and I tested it. I was just hanging onto the handle, standing up in the tram, and I just turned my attention back on my thoughts, and they just went silent.

I thought, "Oh, that's it." I kept doing it, and you'd have like four or five seconds, and then your attention would drift, and then you'd have to bring it back. But I did it and it worked. The next day when I saw Shri Mataji, I said, "I did it. It works. It's fantastic." And she said, "No, you just tell everybody because that's the trick. That's what you need to do." As I was researching later on, I was reading Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, and on page one, he describes that exact experience to be merged with the divine consciousness. You've got to get the right translation, because I've looked at many translations and there were only one or two that kind of got it. It's a little bit poetic, but if you know what it is, you go, "Ah, yeah, that's that thing." So I was meditating with Shri Mataji. That was such an amazing experience. Then we went off to Taipei, and I was tagging along.

She was staying in the presidential suite at the very top floor of this huge hotel. We were up there watching TV with Shri Mataji—myself, a Malaysian yogi, and a bunch of very new Hong Kong yogis. Very fresh, very new, a lot of bhakti, very happy to be with Shri Mataji. We were just sitting at her feet watching CNN or something. Then Shri Mataji says, "Oh, Mark, can you go and get me a glass of water?" I'm like, "Okay." So I get up and I'm walking across the suite, and I see the carpet going like this. The carpet starts to move. I'm looking, going, "What's going on?" And I look, and the books are coming off the bookshelf and the chandelier is shaking. It was an earthquake. We were in an earthquake. The whole place is shaking, and you feel this thunderous roar underneath everything.

I'm like, "Oh my God, I'm in an earthquake with Adi Shakti." In my mind, I was like, "Nothing's going to happen. I'm perfectly protected. I'm right with the Adi Shakti." The yogis who were all quite new were like, "Earthquake! Oh my God!" They didn't speak any English. They got up and they ran out. And I'm just standing there looking at Shri Mataji, just like, "Wow." It was just me and Shri Mataji. Anyway, it stopped. Shri Mataji was looking very concerned and very serious. So I went back to Shri Mataji with the glass of water, and the yogis had started to come back in. They were feeling a bit sheepish because they realized they'd left Shri Mataji there.

So they were pulling their ears as they came in. We went and sat at her feet again. Then it started again, the same thing, but even more intense. One yogi says, "Shri Mataji, what do we do?" And Shri Mataji grabs the arms of the chair and she says, "Let's get out of here!" At which point all of the yogis jump up and they run out and they leave Shri Mataji a second time. So then it all subsided and they came back in again. We were sitting and we said, "Shri Mataji, what's going on?" She said, "No, no, no, it's the dead ancestors, all those dead spirits." Because they do a lot of ancestor worship in those cultures, so the ancestors sometimes get a bit stuck in between worlds. They're kind of stuck in some sort of void, and they were trying to create a situation where the Adi Shakti would bless them with their moksha. She said, "But it doesn't work like that. They have to attain it. They have to come back and they have to get it in the proper way.

That's not the right way to do things." Come back, take another human form, and then they'll get their realization in the proper way, how we got ours. Gosh, fascinating. All because of the ancestor worship. Yeah, and the whole thing was a play, you know, with the yogis and everything about the recognition. It was just a bizarre experience. Even now, recalling it, it just doesn't even feel real. There was something that happened to me in Dubai, speaking of these bizarre experiences. I was working for a newspaper group over there as a publisher. I had a dream of Shri Mataji, and she said, "Oh, I don't want you to do that." I thought, "Oh, well, how do I get out of this?" So I randomly applied for a job in Dubai, and they said, "Come over." So I got this job in Dubai. It was all on a dream that Shri Mataji wanted me to change what I was doing.

I show up, and it's the worst work environment I've ever come across. The politics, the nastiness, just next level. You've got all of the politics of all these different subcultural groups—Arabic politics, Indian politics, Pakistani politics. It's layer upon layer of all the worst aspects of human nature coming out in one work environment. I was kind of thrown into this, and I just wasn't ready. I was too naive, too innocent. I didn't understand anything. I realized within maybe three months that I'm not going to survive here. I'm either going to leave very soon, as in the next working day, or I'm going to get fired. And I'd only been there three months.

In Dubai, in those days they took your passport because they want to keep an eye on you. They gave me quite a big advance, we relocated, and they paid for an apartment rental for a year and a car loan. It was a lot of money, around 60,000 or 70,000 Australian dollars. This was 2005. So I knew the gig was up. I didn't know anyone in Dubai who could help me professionally. It was just a heavy feeling of impending doom. Anyway, a yogi was having a Lakshmi Puja at her house, and she invited me and Sushma over. There were about 20 yogis there. I was just talking to Shri Mataji in my attention.

I was like, "Shri Mataji, here I am. I only came to Dubai because of the dream. I don't know what to do, and this is all going to rain down on me tomorrow at the office. Please, you have to help." The yogini sees that I'm obviously looking quite unhappy, so she says, "Come and put some flowers in front of Shri Mataji." I went, I grabbed the flower, and as I was putting the flower in front of Shri Mataji, I swear, Shri Mataji spoke to me from the photograph. And she said, "You've got yourself in a real mess, haven't you?" And I was like, "Yes, Shri Mataji." She said, "Don't worry, I'll get you out of it." On the way home, I was saying to Sushma, "I don't know, maybe I've got some left side problem," because I was feeling quite overwhelmed. I told her what happened. She said, "When was this?" I said, "When I was putting the flower down." She said, "No, no, no, don't worry. I was meditating and I felt a sudden gush of vibrations and was wondering what it was. So I opened my eyes, and you were putting the flower in front of Shri Mataji. So don't worry, you're not going crazy." I went to work the following day and I got fired, as I expected.

It was either "I resign" or "You're fired." It was one or the other. They said, "You have a non-compete clause in your contract, so you can't work for anyone else. We will enforce it. We want our money in 30 days. We have your passport, and you're not going anywhere until we get our money." They were nasty, next level nasty. I thought, "What do I do? I'm completely snookered." I'm sitting on the edge of the bed feeling quite despondent, and then I realized I knew one guy in Dubai. He was a graphic designer who was fired from the same place, but he was drunk on the job, so he's not really the first person I would have spoken to. Anyway, I ring him up and explain. He's like, "Oh, look, this is Dubai.

This is what happens." He gives me a phone number of an English editor for a newspaper. I ring him. He says, "I can't help you, but ring this guy." He gives me another number. This guy goes, "All right, don't talk to me, talk to this guy." This is all in the space of 15 minutes of phone calls. I ring a guy. He's an Emirati man, a local Arab there. And he says, "Okay, why don't you come and see me? Come and see me now. How quickly can you get here?" I was so overwhelmed, I said, "Is it okay if I bring my wife?" I needed the vibrational support. He's like, "Sure, whatever.

Bring your wife." I showed up, and his office was directly next door to my old office. As I was walking into this Arab guy's building, I could look up and see my old boss in the window. My heart was beating. We walk in with Sushma, go up and see him. He puts a newspaper in front of me and says, "Okay, have a look." I tell him, "Maybe do this, try this, do the other." He says, "All right, okay, I'll give you a job. You start on Sunday." I was like, "Oh, thank you, that's fantastic. But look, I've just got to tell you, I've got some problems." I said, "First of all, I've got a non-compete clause." He says, "Do you know who owns this newspaper? It's His Highness Sheikh Mohammed. It's his family newspaper. You're not going to have any problem with non-compete." I said, "But I also owe them a ton of money." He says, "How much?" I pulled out the thing.

He wrote me a personal check on the spot for that money. "Will that cover it?" I said, "Yeah." Who does that? And then I said, "Look, they've got my passport." He's like, "All right, just wait." He gets on the phone, says something in Arabic. He had someone get in touch with them, and he had one of the office boys go and get my passport. This little guy comes back with my passport and hands it to me. All in one go. So I took the job, and everything was fantastic. We relaunched the newspaper for Sheikh Mohammed. About eight or nine months later, I had a dream of Shri Mataji that night. She's got me by the hand, we're in a restaurant, and she's swinging me around and I'm knocking over all the tables and chairs, and she's just laughing.

Then she kind of pulls me up this huge step, puts me at the top of it, and she says, "Don't mess it up." In the dream. So that was my bona fide, life-saving experience. Then there was the Shri Hanuman one. We were going out to Birdsville, the most remote township in Australia. You drive for days without seeing another car. I was with a journalist, and we had a long-range Land Cruiser. We didn't have a satellite phone. My partner had forgotten to ring ahead to our next stop, so we had to make it. It was about a nine-hour drive through the desert. It was Christmas Eve, really, really hot, the hottest Christmas in 50 years.

We're driving along on this unsealed dirt road. We come down this one hill, and I see at the bottom something that doesn't look quite right. It's a sort of patchy, weird-looking stretch of road. I said to my partner, "What do you reckon about that?" He's like, "Oh, you'll be fine. Just stay the same speed and aquaplane through it." We drove down and into this thing, and it was very silty sand, like quicksand. The car just sank straight into it, all the way down to the door line. I put it back into first and tried to get it out. Wheels were spinning, nothing was happening. We got out. It's 50-odd degrees.

My partner was a really elite-level journalist, a cool guy. We thought, we're going to have to chalk the wheels with something. There's nothing. It's a Martian moonscape. So we got his Louis Vuitton luggage and packed it under the wheels. He was happy to do it because he knew the only alternative was we were going to die out here. A couple of days before that, we'd actually covered a Japanese motorcyclist who died in exactly the same circumstances. We chalked the wheels, nothing happened. We let the tires down a little bit. We just didn't really know what we were doing.

We were just standing there with our hands on our hips, looking at this thing going, "I don't know, what do we do?" And you can't leave the car. You will for sure die if you leave the car. I got in the car, put myself in bandhan, and just kind of went into meditation as much as I could. I was just like, "Lord Hanuman"—I'd never prayed to Lord Hanuman at that point—"Lord Hanuman, please forgive me for my mistakes. But please, you have to get us out of here. I humbly surrender this to you." Then I put the car into first gear, and this journalist is standing outside watching. I revved it all the way to redline and then popped the clutch. I just felt the whole thing surge out, which had never happened before. It surged straight out. I drove maybe another 15 meters, stopped the car, and threw all the luggage back in.

This journalist is jumping up and down like a kid. He's like, "What's all this? What did you do?" I'm going, "Look, I just don't want to talk about it. Just get in the car." He says, "No, you have to tell me what you did." I said, "Nah, it's all right." He says, "No, no, you don't understand. Because I was outside the car. What I felt was the car go like this"—he makes a motion of a car lurching forward—"but that's not what happened. The car went like this"—he lifts his hand straight up—"Wow. It was like someone picked it up. It came all the way out, even the tires came all the way out, and then it went across and went down." He didn't speak much after that because I just didn't know how to talk about it. I wasn't in the mood to go into, "Well, yoga and yada yada yada." We made it to Birdsville, got into the hotel room, and I get this room and it has, I kid you not, a black and white photograph of a horse and cart bogged in the same area, like a hundred years before or something.

I'm just looking at this picture going, "Am I in some kind of simulation or something? What's going on?" So that was Lord Hanuman. That started a very... I then became really fascinated with Shri Hanuman. I used to say the Hanuman Chalisa every day. There was one talk where Shri Mataji was saying that when we talk to her, we shouldn't address everything to the CEO; you talk to the department managers. The deities are the department managers. So we were going through a bit of a hard time in Dubai. I'd started a business in 2013, and just nothing was happening. We were a bit stuck, running out of money.

We thought, "Let's do a puja. Let's go to the department managers." We did a proper puja, sit-down, five elements, everything. We started with a puja to Shri Ganesha: "Please, Lord, remove the obstacles to the success of my business." Then Shri Mahalakshmi, the bestower of wealth and prosperity: "Mother, please bless us with wealth and prosperity." Then Shri Hanuman. We said the Hanuman Chalisa and sang that really lovely Hanuman bhajan. We just said to him, "Lord, please forgive us for our mistakes, but Lord, please, can you work out something? Take action that this business should work out." Twenty-four hours later, not even a full day, I get a phone call from an old work colleague. She says, "I'm at BBDO now," which is a big global agency. "I've got a project. Can you come and see me?" I went and saw her, and it turned out it was for the electrification of villages in Africa by GE. It was all bankrolled by GE in New York, being run through BBDO in New York.

That's the absolute Ivy League agency, the Ivy League client. And I just landed the biggest client from the biggest agency in the world in less than 24 hours after doing this puja. The idea for the film actually came from Shri Mataji because they were like, "We've got to electrify the villages, how do we do it?" I remembered that story Shri Mataji told about the elephant in the room. In the dark, people feel the leg and think it's a pipe, or they feel the trunk and think it's a water spout, or the body is like a wall. Then when the light comes on, they see it's an elephant. You have to have your enlightenment to understand the truth. I thought, "That's the film." I rewrote that story as a 90-second film. We went to Africa and shot the thing. Everything worked out miraculously. When I got the film done, I sent it in.

Two days later, a single-line email comes back from GE in New York, and it just says, "Top of the class." They ran it pan-Africa across the entire continent, 90 seconds untouched. They didn't touch anything I did. They made all of the other filmmakers go out and reshoot their stuff to make it more authentic and warm and human. It was just like, "What's going on?" I can't even take credit. I can't take credit for getting the film, for the idea, for anything. I attributed it 100% to them. I was not getting anywhere, and then in 24 hours, it all turned around. It's not even belief; it's knowing. They're there. I had another experience, which was on an India tour in 1993 or '94.

I'm with this American guy, his first tour. We get in this rickshaw, and I say to the driver where to go. He's a bit vague, but the vibrations were so nice, I thought, "Ah, it's okay, he knows where to go." I was just relaxed. Next thing, I have this really panicky thought: "We're never going to get there." I witnessed the thought and was like, "Nah, it's all right," and just dismissed it. Then the American guy grabs me by the arm and says, "This guy doesn't know where we're going! We're never going to get there!" I realized I was thinking his thoughts. I told Shri Mataji about it. I said, "Mother, I had this really funny experience." She said, "No, no. Have you heard of the hundredth monkey theory?" She explained that there was a study where they followed monkeys on various islands near Japan. One monkey would wash its fruit in the water and wouldn't get sick.

Other monkeys witnessed that, and when the number hit a hundred monkeys washing their fruit, that same intuition would be carried through to monkeys unrelated to those monkeys on other islands. They intuitively understood they had to wash their fruit. She said, "That's how Sahaja Yoga is going to work out in the world. You have to hit a tipping point." The reason Shri Mataji went on to say that the reason why you take bandhan is because you are catching the thoughts of other people. Thoughts travel in an electromagnetic field. They're not even in your head. She did say that when you catch the thoughts of people, you have to be protected. She told me you should take a bandhan every time you're in a new situation. As you leave the house, take a bandhan. In the car park, take a bandhan.

You can do it with your attention. Going into a meeting, take a bandhan, just in your attention. When I started doing that, I noticed I didn't catch much at all. I'd come home and not be caught up. Such a protection and such a blessing from Shri Mataji for all of us. Thank you so much for sharing such lovely stories and bringing them to life for our viewers. No worries at all. I hope it helps. I think the main thing for me is that if other people can feel... because Sahaja Yoga ultimately is all about direct experience. You can have all the mental stuff, you can know about chakras, you can be a really good-hearted person, you can have a lot of bhakti.

Ultimately, it's your spiritual experience that's going to help you ascend and keep you interested. You have to yearn for that, pray for it, meditate on it. That should be a core part of you as an individual. Even one really great meditation is irrefutable. No one can take Sahaja Yoga from you when you can say, "Yeah, but I had that experience." And no one can take that away from you. So I would definitely say that experience is the key, and you should really push hard and really yearn for it. Fantastic. Thank you very much for joining us. Thank you so much for making it happen. Jai Shri Mataji.
