I have a little bit of a cold, so I hope you guys won't mind. Also, thanks a lot for inviting me; I appreciate it. I know some of you also want to hear about the Native Americans, but I told Carolyn that I think that is a program in itself because it's such an important aspect of Sahaja Yoga. It wasn't just me; there were many, many yogis involved in it. We also spoke about Michael Fuseli and Steve Day. And hopefully, Jill Bajeski is on here. She's been very instrumental with the progress and the building of Kanachari. I was involved with the Native American programs myself with other yogis. We visited the Native American reservations. But I think it's a good idea if we combine both my experiences and the importance of Kanachari. I think that can happen in the future when Carolyn would like it to happen.

So basically, I'm going to share with you some very interesting experiences that I had before and after Sahaja Yoga. I've been blessed so many times by our Divine Mother because, as I was telling Carolyn a couple of weeks ago, before Sahaja Yoga, I was really very, very sick. Had it not been for Shri Mataji coming into my life and me practicing Sahaja Yoga, I would probably be dead by now. And that's the truth. Because of the liver, the emotional stuff, all of the junk and the negativities that we pick up in our childhood.

I came into Sahaja Yoga in 1983, and it's been an incredible journey since then. It continues to be such an important part of my life. Sahaja Yoga, to me, there's nothing more important. But anyway, it was about two or three months before I did meet Shri Mataji in 1983 that I was getting really, really sick. I was smoking, I was trying to raise my son, and I had a lot of financial problems trying to get my life together. I was getting really sick, physically ill, and I knew I had to do something. I just kept praying, and I kept saying, "God, what am I supposed to be doing? How can I improve my life?"

At that time, my husband was doing Hatha Yoga, so he suggested that, and I did start Hatha Yoga. I did only a couple of programs. In the second or third program that I did, I remember it was a young man named Joseph. We did some of the physical exercises, but then I would notice that when we did the Hatha Yoga, the right side of my body would still keep hurting. That was my main problem at that time because I kept getting all this pain in my right side. I didn't know then that it was, of course, the liver and the right Swadhisthana. So the Hatha Yoga was not doing it for me, because every time I would go to the class, I would leave, and my right side would still be in pain. I said, "This is not helping me."

Anyway, the last class that I had with this young man, Joseph, we did the exercises, and I was in pain. He started talking about going to India, and immediately, I got very interested. He said that he was going to go to India to see a famous guru who was making diamonds come out of his hands and also would make rice come out of his hands to feed the poor people. As he was saying this, I kept thinking to myself, "Something's not right here," because I felt instinctively that it was not right. He kept talking about the program and what he was going to do, and inside of me, I said, "Something is wrong here." I didn't accept what he was saying, but I didn't say anything out of respect for him.

I left his venue, and I remember going out and waiting for the bus. That was in Manhattan; I think it was the Upper West Side. I was waiting at the bus stop, and I started thinking of what this guy told me. All of a sudden, as I was standing waiting for the bus, my eyes just automatically closed. I was not in control. My eyes automatically closed, and a vision appeared in my mind. I saw this background of like hills, and standing in front of these hills was the figure of a woman dressed in white. She was in profile, and Her hair was very long and black, and it looked like a braid to me. Still. And then I could feel these rocks underneath my feet, like tiny little pebbles underneath my feet. I don't know why, but I remember that. I could feel these pebbles underneath my feet. The vision was in a grayish color, but Shri Mataji's gown was totally white, and She was standing in profile.

I didn't know who that was. I didn't know what was happening, but I felt that it was something right, that to me seemed okay. Then the vision disappeared, and I got on the bus, still thinking about what had happened. Then I started having some kind of a vision where it was something I could not even imagine or understand. As I was sitting on the bus going home, I had this kind of a vision of something very, very primordial happening, as if it was the beginning of the earth, the beginning of something, I don't know what. And then it stopped.

I went home, and that evening, my son was home from school. I was preparing dinner, my husband went to work, and I was sitting on the couch. I started to think of what happened at this Hatha Yoga teacher's class. Then all of a sudden, I had to open up my hands. All of this happened beyond my control; I just felt that I had to open up my hands. I closed my eyes, and I heard this incredible sound. It was the sound of a wind, just coming from out of nowhere, and it was just coming towards me. It was like the sound of a wind, and it was coming towards me. It penetrated my head; it penetrated the top of my head. At the same time, I looked at my son and realized he was okay, and he was doing the same thing. He was sitting down, he had stopped playing with his toys, and he was also holding up his hands and had his eyes closed. So we were both sitting there—I was on the couch, he was on the floor—and we were taking in this incredible energy. I just let it come in because I knew it was something good, and I didn't fight it or anything. I have no idea how long it lasted. Maybe a minute, two minutes, five minutes, I don't know. But then, when the wind stopped, my entire body felt healthy. It felt good.

I knew something had happened to me that was really nice, and yet I couldn't figure out what it was. After that, my son and I went back to what we were doing. I think I was watching TV or reading a book, I don't remember, and he was playing with his toys. My hands felt energized. There was energy running through my hands, but I couldn't figure out what it was. I knew it was good. And then I went on with my life.

Two or three weeks later, I kept thinking about that and still couldn't figure out what it was. Once in a while, I would get this sickening feeling in my stomach, like my body being ill. Every time my body started getting ill, I would say, "God, please help me. Please help me." And I could feel my hands pulsating. It was like I could feel my fingers, like energy was running through my fingers, and my hands were pulsating. Then I would feel good. I would feel good again. This continued for about three or four weeks, and I still didn't know what was going on. I stopped going to Hatha Yoga because I felt that what he had told me was wrong. I just continued with my life, and every time I kept feeling sick, I would say, "God help me," and my hands would pulsate without me knowing what was happening. But I knew it was good. I knew that something was coming my way that was helping. I knew it was God, but how can you explain what is God?

Then, about a month and a half later, I was down in the Village—no, I was not in Greenwich Village. I forgot what I was doing, but I walked into this deli. As I looked on the left-hand side, I looked up, and there was a poster of this beautiful woman. I'm thinking, "Oh my God, She was so beautiful." I still have that poster, by the way. I had never seen anybody so beautiful. Then I read the information on the yoga program: "Awaken the Kundalini," the time and the date, and so forth. I wrote it down.

When I got home, I called, and they said, "Oh, Mother is coming in a couple of weeks. Come to the program." I'm saying, "Mother? Why is she saying Mother? Why is that? Why 'Mother'?" It was Judy Gabby's voice; some of you, I'm sure, know her. She's the one that first answered. But then, the funny thing is, I kind of forgot about that. I just went to work or went about doing my own stuff. About a couple of weeks later, I called again, and this time Michael Fuseli answered. I didn't know who it was, but it was Michael. And he said, "Yes, yes, She will be coming in a few days. Come to the program. You can learn about the Kundalini and you can learn about the chakras."

So, I did go to the program. It was September 16th, 1983, at the Carl Jung Center. It was on East 38th Street and Fifth Avenue. I remember walking in; my brother-in-law was with me. I remember walking in, and She started the program. First of all, there was a very dynamic woman who was talking about Carl Jung and the chakras, talking about evolution and spirituality and so forth. Then, She came on. I was looking at Her, and I said, "Oh my God, She's so beautiful. My God, I've never seen anything so beautiful in my life." Again, She was dressed all in white. I just listened to Her. We went through the self-realization. I didn't feel that much because I was still physically sick. My right side was completely messed up. My left side, who knows where it was—that came later. But the negativity was embedded in there, although I wasn't aware of the negativity. But it was there.

When the program was over, I didn't feel that much. But then, I remember Her walking down the stairs; somebody was helping Her. She came down the stairs, and She was saying hello to everyone. But the funny thing is, I did not trust Her. Isn't it funny? I grew up in a Catholic environment, and I had dealt with quite a few Catholic priests and nuns. Most of them, I have to say, were not very nice. A couple of them were very, very good, but I was hesitant to accept anyone who talked about spirituality. So, I didn't say anything. Now when I think about it, I feel bad. But my hesitation to accept any spiritual person was so strong because I had such a negative experience in the Catholic church when I was young.

Anyway, we went home. I felt okay. I took the information about the programs, and I went back. I forgot exactly what happened in between, but I remember we had a big seminar up in Deer Park, New York. The yogis were telling me, "Come to the seminar. Shri Mataji will be there. It'll be a three-day weekend." And I said, "I want to go." Because even though I wasn't fully convinced of what was happening to me, I wanted to go. In that meantime, I did start foot soaking, by the way, and I did feel a little better. But of course, I should have been doing it much more, maybe two or three times a week. Physically, I was feeling a little better, and I said, "Let me just go to the program."

That Friday afternoon, I went to Judy's house because they were going to pick us up. I'm sitting there, dozing off on the couch, waiting for the ride. There were three or four of us, and I hear Judy Gabby—and I know most of you know her—saying... well, she was talking to one of the ladies there. "Well, Shri Mataji was the Madonna. She was the mother of Jesus Christ." At that moment, I woke up. I came out of my daze, and I said to myself, "What? The mother of Jesus Christ?" I was confused. But something just... boom. Something hit me. Something really, really woke me up. I couldn't talk; I couldn't say anything. So I told Judy I was just going to go for a coffee. I just needed to go out. I went outside to a coffee shop, and I was drinking this coffee, and I remember thinking, "The mother of Jesus Christ. Wow."

Then all of a sudden, something in my awareness, something so primordial... it's hard to explain what I was feeling because it's inside of my head. It's an experience, and it's hard to explain this very primordial, ancient memory. I was just astounded. I'm thinking, "What is happening to me?" But all the time, I knew it was something very good, that it was something for me to accept.

We finally got our ride, and we went to Deer Park. Mother gave a seminar, and I still remember looking at Her, thinking She was just this very good, beautiful woman. She gave a wonderful seminar, and we could ask questions. My question, I asked about my son. Because at that time, I was smoking, and my son's ears, both left and right, had inflammation. She told me how to use olive oil and to warm up cloves and garlic in the olive oil and put the drops in his ears.

That evening, after the seminar was over, I went outside again. I was walking back and forth, back and forth, because there was something I couldn't grasp. I knew somebody was not telling me something. Because I kept thinking, "She's the mother of Jesus Christ. What is going on here?" So I kept walking back and forth. Then, all of a sudden, I remember Michael Petrunia—some of you may know him; he passed on now—but Michael came by. He said, "Anna, what's going on?" I said, "What is going on here, Michael? There's something I don't understand. What is this about Shri Mataji? Why this seminar? What is going on?"

And he said, "But Anna, don't you know? This is the Last Judgment." I'm listening to him, and he said, "The men that are traveling with Shri Mataji are the twelve disciples, and She's the Holy Spirit."

Then I thought, and I said, "Well, if She's the Holy Spirit and this is the Last Judgment, does that mean that everything is going to change from now on? That the world is going through a very, very big change?" And he said, "Yeah, of course. That's the truth."

All of a sudden, I started thinking, feeling the pebbles underneath my feet that I had experienced after I left the yoga teacher. And then, I looked in the back. I automatically just turned my head and looked in the back, and I saw the hills. Then I realized that the vision I had had, and all of those experiences of my hands pulsating... it was Shri Mataji. She was the Holy Spirit. She had come into my life, and I knew that this was something so important and with a great purpose. It all started to come together at that point. It was probably one of the most powerful experiences I ever had, the realization that the Holy Spirit was on earth. And yet, at that point, like most of the yogis, we still couldn't comprehend just the intensity and the nature of the Holy Spirit.

Anyway, that weekend was very, very intense. I just remember the feeling, the power of the experience itself, of the realization of what was happening in my life.

At one point, we were told we could write letters to Shri Mataji before we would go back to New York. I wrote a letter, and I gave it to one of the yogis. In my letter, I wrote, "Dear Shri Mataji, who is God? What is my purpose on earth? And what am I doing here?" I gave the letter to the yogi and totally forgot about it. After that, I started going to the programs, doing more foot soaking, and feeling much, much better. I hadn't stopped smoking yet; that took me six months. But I finally did.

Just a couple more experiences. I had forgotten about that letter. About a month and a half or two months later, I was sleeping. In the meantime, I started going to the programs whenever I could, feeling better, and trying to understand what was happening with my chakras, my fingers, and so forth, just trying to insert my way into the life of a Sahaja Yogini. One evening, I was sleeping, and I had a dream. In this dream, I saw Shri Mataji again. She was dressed all in white, and She was standing so tall and so majestic. She was holding a paper in Her hand, and somehow I knew that was my letter. And She said, "I am aware." I said, "Oh, wow." I got this feeling of total joy, total happiness, that She had come into my dream and that She had read my letter. She said, "I am aware." The dream ended, and I went back to sleep. I slept so soundly that night.

About a week later, I went to the school to pick up my son. He was five years old, in kindergarten or first grade, I think. I was waiting for him, sitting on a bench outside the school. I'm sitting on the bench, and I'm thinking about that dream. All of a sudden, I had to close my eyes. All of a sudden, my Kundalini shot up. It went like a wind, it shot up, and it hit my Agnya. At that level, the Agnya, it stopped. I saw two or three images, and one of them was an image of my past life.

Although I knew it was the Kundalini, I instinctively understood what was happening. Because when something of the nature of the divinity occurs, the divinity, if it wants, will allow you to understand what is going on. This is something too divine for the human mind to comprehend, but it was happening to me, and I knew that I was understanding what was happening. The Kundalini allowed that; I knew that. I saw an image of my past life as the Kundalini was in my Agnya, and I understood the Kundalini was telling me that we evolved through reincarnation, that it is through past lifetimes that we grow. We go through these lifetimes and eventually, we will find our source.

After that was understood, the Kundalini went into my Sahasrara. And my Sahasrara... you know how Shri Mataji explains the thousand petals are like flowers? That's exactly what happened. It went like this, and the Kundalini was fully awakened in my Sahasrara. My Sahasrara was fully opened, and Shri Mataji allowed me to experience just what it means to be fully, fully connected to our source, to who God is. I remember hearing the word "Akasha." As this opened up, there was a world you can't start to explain because it's a dimension that human beings cannot fully understand. It's a divine dimension, so far removed from the human. It was the universe. I saw the entire, beautiful, magnificent universe in its energy. Everything was white. Now, is it really like this? This is what Shri Mataji allowed me to understand: that our Sahasrara, when we are fully opened to the divinity, we are in a different dimension. This is what I understood. It may be something different, but this is what Shri Mataji allowed me to experience.

It was a universe of divinity, where there was a total understanding, total love. The love was permeating everywhere, and it was just so beautiful. And then there was this huge, big, white ball of energy, and somehow that was just love. It was love personified. It was just this energy. I said, "Wow, that's God. It's got to be God." Then I saw these tiny little white things, they looked like little balls, but they were like tiny little planets. They were also white, just like the huge big one. And somehow, I understood these little white balls were the yogis.

From that experience, Shri Mataji was telling me that we are headed towards a divine world. It's so much for the human brain to understand. This is the only way I can explain it. Because at the moment that my Sahasrara was opened, I was fully connected to it. It was total love, total knowledge. It had complete knowledge of everything. And somehow, I heard this again; I heard the word "Akasha." When I was telling this to somebody, they told me that Akasha, those are like the records, the recordings of the universe, of whatever is going on in the world. The Akasha records.

I didn't know how long it lasted, but then it went, "Boom!" The Sahasrara just quickly closed. It was just like, "Boom!" And I was back in the human state. At that moment, I heard, "Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!" It was my poor son calling me. He said, "Mommy, Mommy, come on. What's the matter?" But I felt like I was drunk because the energy above my head was so powerful, and it was also permeating my total body, but it was mostly focused on my head. My son is pulling on me... one second, hold on guys. When I talk about this, my mouth gets so dry.

But my son took me out of this state, the state of what Shri Mataji wants all of us to be, where we're meant to be. That's why we're given self-realization and we're given this great, tremendous, powerful gift. So, I walked my son home. He kept saying, "Come on, Mommy, hurry up!" And I was like drunk. I couldn't even walk because the energy up there was so intense. We finally got home. Luckily, my husband was there, he took over and watched my son, and I had to go to sleep.

As I was walking home, Shri Mataji allowed me to understand that we are the spirit. We're in a physical body, but our spirit is there. And She allowed me to experience the complete, total difference between who we are as the spirit and who we are as our body. As these things were happening to me, She allowed me to understand just what was going on. I remember when I got home, I had to go to sleep because my body was so tired from the experience, although I knew it was something very magnificent.

This is part of what Shri Mataji blessed me with. I was talking to Carolyn a couple of weeks ago, and I was thinking, "Why doesn't everybody experience this?" And then, as I was talking to her, I also realized that it was because She wanted me to stay in Sahaja Yoga. Had She not allowed me to fully, fully understand just what Sahaja Yoga is and who we are and what our role is in this evolutionary process, I probably would have left. I would have left Sahaja Yoga because I was very sick. I was very, very sick, and I probably would have left. Okay, I did have the relief of the right side, because the right side is so easy to clear. But then the left side, which was even more imbalanced in me, Shri Mataji took care of that later, because it wasn't time yet.

It's just something that is hard for people to understand because it's a vibrational energy that happens. This is what Shri Mataji talks about all the time: is the energy. And this is what we're working with.

Just one more thing, I don't know how much time we have...

[Response from host: Just two more things. Anna, I just want to say, yeah, we have as much time as you want. It's 8:30 now, our time. We can go on until nine o'clock, quite easily. So just talk until you finish telling the stories you need to tell.]

I just wanted to say a couple more things because they're important. They're important because I think we all have to realize just the tremendous times that we're living in. These are so important. I know we've heard this before; we hear it all the time. Shri Mataji tells us this all the time. And yet, how much of it do we really, really appreciate? And how much of it do we really understand? And how much do we imbibe it? I think that's probably the most important aspect of Sahaja Yoga. How much of Shri Mataji's work, how much of Her dedication, how much of the blessings She has given us, do we imbibe? I try to imbibe it as much as I can. I've made mistakes, a lot of them. I made big booboos in Sahaja Yoga because we're all human beings. Sahaja Yoga to me is a journey. First of all, it's an individual journey where we have to know who we are. Like in that experience I had, it's the reincarnation through these lifetimes we go through, that we are on this journey to reach our source. But as Sahaja Yogis, we have to imbibe it. We have to live it. We have to really, really appreciate just the tremendous blessings that the Adi Shakti has given us.

So basically, just some more things. I already told Carolyn this. The right side eventually got balanced. Even though, if I'm not careful, the liver will go out, but it's mostly under control. But we know that the left side is very, very deep and complicated. It's a complicated channel because it's our emotions, the intangible things that are hard for us to comprehend many times. The right side, sure. The liver creates the heat if we don't eat well, if we're too much into the future. We just have to put ourselves back into the present, do a foot soak, you put ice on your liver, you eat well, and it's fairly easy to clear unless it's something very, very serious. But it's usually fairly easy to clear.

But the left side is really so complicated. As I was telling Carolyn, I don't even remember my childhood. That's probably why. But I wasn't the only one that experienced these incredible things. I know that Javier's father experienced the same thing. I was talking to Javier one time, quite a few years ago, and he said his father experienced the exact same thing of when the Kundalini came up and he saw in his Sahasrara, opened. So it's not just me. I'm not saying that just because I experienced these things, I'm special. I think what Shri Mataji does, She knows what each one of us needs. She knows each one of us as individuals. Yes, we're a cell in Her body, but She knows everything about us. Everything. She knows us down to the minimum part of our little chakra. She knows what lives we've led. She understands. All She has to do is look at you, and She knows everything about you.

So basically, after I cleared my right side, then She said, "Okay, now it's time for Me to work on your left side." I didn't realize... I think a lot of us, when we first come to Sahaja Yoga, we think, "Oh my God, the Holy Spirit, She's here! Finally! It's what we were always looking for. Now our lives have meaning." But many times, I think... I've talked to quite a few yogis who say they think that everybody's going to understand this. But they don't. In the first times in Sahaja Yoga, I tried to tell people about Sahaja Yoga and about Shri Mataji, and they didn't get it. And I'm wondering why. I somehow made a mistake of telling people, maybe too often, that Shri Mataji is the Holy Spirit. It's something so important, and I didn't know why they couldn't get it. I hadn't understood yet the process of spiritual evolution and the process of cleansing the chakras and how ready we are to get to know the divinity. So that made me make a few mistakes, and I think quite a few yogis have done that also.

Anyway, so we started programs. We did programs—not just me, with other yogis—in the prisons, we did programs in drug rehab. It was never just me alone; there were so many other wonderful yogis. I went on with my Sahaja Yoga work.

It was only in 1997 that I began to realize that something was happening within me that I needed to address, that I hadn't quite yet fully comprehended. I had a dream one evening. In this dream, I was sitting next to Shri Mataji, on Her left side. All around me, all these yogis were running around, busy preparing this and preparing that. They were all preparing for a program. And I'm sitting next to Her, and Shri Mataji said to me, "I have to work on you alone." And the dream ended. I didn't quite understand what that meant.

A couple of weeks later, I found myself... I did leave Sahaja Yoga. I found that I couldn't go to the collective, personally. I wasn't told not to go; I just couldn't go. I don't know why. Then I started having these dreams of my past, and I started having all these headaches, my Back Agnya. You see, I don't remember my childhood, and I think that's probably why Shri Mataji allowed me to experience these things. Because had I not experienced them, I probably would have left Sahaja Yoga, not realizing its importance, because I had too many catches. There was too much darkness that needed to be addressed, and I couldn't quite understand why they were happening. But if we're seekers, if we really want to know ourselves and we pray to Her, She will allow you to understand who you are in this great big scheme of Sahaja Yoga, this Last Judgment, these incredible times that we're living in.

So anyway, after I left the collective for a while, I started having these dreams of my childhood. I started getting headaches, and the headaches were so intense that not even aspirin could take the pain away. Sometimes the headaches would be so intense that I would have to hold my head like this. It was my Back Agnya. Basically, Shri Mataji was starting to work on my Back Agnya. How it started was... I forget what month it was. We were supposed to have a big parade on Fifth Avenue in 1990. I wanted to go, but I was sitting in my kitchen and I could not move. I was trying to meditate and trying to go to the parade because they were going to have a parade with Shri Mataji's banner, with the music and so forth. And I couldn't move. I'm sitting down, and I was meditating, and all of a sudden, I see my Kundalini in my head. I see the Kundalini shoot up my spine. The spinal cord was fire. It came up along the spinal cord and it came to my left side. I'm just sitting there, just trying to meditate because my body was in just horrible pain. It was Shri Mataji clearing away my past, trying to open up my Back Agnya. I think I sat there for at least an hour and a half, and I couldn't move.

I was finally able to sit down. But then, for a whole year, what would happen is I could feel the Back Agnya... you know how the Back Agnya goes this way and it comes around to the back? The Back Agnya here was opening up, like stretching out like this, little by little. And as it opened up, little by little, the headaches were horrible. It was so painful. That's how closed my Back Agnya was. I had forgotten my childhood; I had forgotten my memory. Shri Mataji was working on my left side, and that took a year. Again, it was Her blessings. All of this came about because I hadn't yet fully comprehended or understood just how bad my Back Agnya had been. I knew that I didn't remember anything from my childhood until I was eight. And even now, I have problems with memory. It's not as bad, but I hadn't realized that this was a really, really bad left-side catch.

I think I know now why Shri Mataji said, "I have to work on you alone." Because had I been in the collective, it would have been even more painful. The vibrations of the collective would have probably tried to open up the Back Agnya even quicker, and it would have been more painful. I think that's probably why it took a full year, almost a year and a half, to fully understand just how the Back Agnya was closed and how it was not operating at all, let's put it that way. I was only to the right side. I was doing the programs, this and this. That's what we're here to do. Some yogis thought I was nuts. Of course, they still do. But I guess it was because Shri Mataji allowed me to fully comprehend what our responsibilities are in Sahaja Yoga. So I went with that in the beginning. For the first few years, we did programs. But then I had a pushback because I had to clear an even more intense part of me, which was the left side.

I was telling Carolyn that after about a year, a year and a half, I could feel the difference. I never realized that I didn't have any peripheral vision. After about a year, I remember feeling good. The headaches finally stopped, and I felt so much lighter. I felt like this incredible weight had been taken away from me. I felt lighter, more bouncy, more happy. I remember I was sitting in a car or a bus somewhere, and we're looking at the traffic lights, and the traffic lights were changing from green to red, green to red. I'm looking at the lights, and I never realized that I was almost colorblind. After this year of Shri Mataji working on my Back Agnya, the colors were so bright. I didn't realize that I was missing out on seeing the beautiful, vibrant colors. They became vibrant after my Back Agnya cleared.

And then also, I began to have peripheral vision. I didn't realize that I did not have peripheral vision. It was after almost a year and a half that I could see on the sides of my face. So, that was another thing I wanted to share with you because this is the way Shri Mataji works. It's not just meditating, foot soaking, doing programs—the things that we're all taught, that we all do. But every day there is something for us to imbibe and to live, to live fully as yogis. It's just a tremendous life.

After that, I realized that I was using so much of my right side, which was good, but at the same time, I realized that it was kind of too forceful. I had to go back and balance it with the left. Again, Shri Mataji made me realize it; She made me go through the cleansing, the process of removal. Because actually, that's what it is, isn't it? When the Kundalini cleanses a chakra or a channel, it's removing negative vibrations that are embedded in us that need to be removed. Once they are removed, we reach a higher state of understanding of our vibrational being. Basically, that's what it is.

Many other miracles happened that would take maybe too long to speak about. I'm going to send you a photo that you guys can see. I'll explain a little bit now what it is. I'll just talk about that one photo. Again, it's just to share with you the power of our Mother. We are so blessed. Like I was talking to my yogi brother, Jerry, and he was saying people think we're nuts because if we try to tell them what we go through spiritually, people don't understand it because they're not there yet. We hope everybody can get there. But we're just blessed. Shri Mataji blessed me with so much. Again, I have not been a perfect yogi. I've made so many mistakes. I know most of you know my mistakes. But we have to learn. We have to overcome our negative thoughts, our negative past. That's probably the worst thing to try to overcome: the negativity from our past. It wants to hold on to you. The past, the bhoots, the negativity doesn't want to leave. They want to hang on to you. They don't want to leave because they have nowhere to go, or they know that if they hang on, then there's somewhere they can somehow work through you. But they don't want to leave. This is our work: to remove those negative entities, the negative experiences, in order for us to basically reach the highest.

This is where it takes courage. It takes desire. I grew up in... my family was great, they're good, I'm not saying anything bad against anybody, but the environment that I grew up in when I was small in Italy was very, very... it was the worst kind of negative stuff about the superstitious part of Catholicism that did a bad number on me. We have to overcome it. We just have to let it go. Sometimes it'll come and try to take over. But we have our Mother. We have our Kundalinis. We have to be Her strong children. Because if we're not, who are we? We have to be worthy of what She's given us.

Anyway, I will send you the photo. That's another miracle. I'll send it on the WhatsApp group. It was a small little photo, like four-by-four. Usually, photos are either four-by-six or five-by-seven. The year that I came to Sahaja Yoga, 1983, that December, I was in Judy Gabby's house. She was giving a meditation program for Christmas, and it was like a pre-Christmas celebration. I went, and John Partridge also came back from India. Some of you may know him. He sometimes meditates, but he's not really fully in the collective. He brought back the book The Advent, and he gave me a copy. He was giving a copy to all of the new seekers that were there. We were maybe six or seven. We meditated, and John told his experiences in India.

He gave me a photo, and I looked at it. Then we were going to start the meditation, so I just put it in the book. I forgot about that photo. That evening, I went home. Of course, I enjoyed John's recollections of India and how we all need to go to India and things like that. I went home and I happened to open up the book and I saw the photo. I kept looking at the photo, and I saw Shri Mataji. Then I kept looking. She was holding a little boy in Her bosom. She had Her right hand on his center heart and Her left hand on his... I think it was the left, like this, and Her right hand on his center heart. I kept looking and looking. It was only the back of the head, and I said, "My God, that's my son's hair. That's my son. She's holding my son." I couldn't see his face, but that was his hair, brown hair. And the clothes, I recognized his clothes that he had, although I could only see just the top portion of his body.

Then I looked again, and I saw this little thing on the left side of Shri Mataji. And I was on the left side of Shri Mataji, with my red jacket that I had bought at the Salvation Army because at that time I didn't have much money. I said, "Oh my God." I called John. I said, "John, where did you get this photo?" He said, "What photo?" I said, "The photo that you gave me." He said, "I don't know, it just came out of my camera." But I've never been to India. He had brought the pictures from India, and that's where he took the photos. It was from India. I said, "But I've never been there. We just came to Sahaja Yoga in September." And he said, "I don't know."

So that's another miracle photo I can send to you guys. The border is like a white border, and it looks like a four-by-four, with equal sides. Usually, pictures are not equal sides. This is four-by-four, it's a white border, and Shri Mataji's eyes are sparkling. She was holding my son.

I just want to end this presentation with just the one experience that I think we should all know about, just what's happening nowadays. We see Shri Mataji getting old, She was ill, and in Her last years, She was in a wheelchair. Of course, whatever Mother went through is because of us. To clear us, to clear humanity, and to bring forth the spiritual evolution where we are meant to be in this process of spirituality. And it was 2006...
