Sab Chijo me Mahamantra ho, India, 16-03-1977

[English to Hindi translation]

I had told you that during meditation if you sit facing me like this and your consciousness slowly flow inward, it will awaken your Kundalini. This whole process seems like a child's play. And you must have seen those people here who were Sahaja Yogis, who were rotating their hands and giving you some consciousness and doing some work. If these things are seen in a casual way, it seems like child's play.

When Prophet Muhammad advised people to perform prayers, they used to make fun of him. Similarly, when rituals like homa and havan were initiated in our country since ancient times, there were people who thought, "What foolishness is this?" Why do we do this? And when these practices become customary, people accept them as if they are an integral part of their lives. Like greeting someone. We Indians greet someone as soon as we see them. We don't ask why we fold our hands in this manner while greeting. And during worship, why do we perform the aarti in a certain way and rotate our hands in a specific manner? Why do we perform aarti with a lamp? We don't ask these questions. Whatever someone tells us, we start performing the aarti accordingly. Because due to the familiarity of these practices, they become very simple and natural for us, they easily become a part of our inner self, our personality. But in every worship, in every form, in every expression, there is a significant meaning. There is a profound significance to every ritual, every mantra, and every type of prayer. Just like the Lord's Prayer of Christianity, which we call the "Lord's Prayer", it contains a profound mantra. In the phrase 'Allahu Akbar,' there is a profound mantra. In 'Soham,' there is a profound mantra. There is a profound mantra in everything, but there are no rules as to where, in what situation, for what purpose, or by whom that mantra should be used."

Because there are no rules in matters of religion in the world. Every individual can awaken their Kundalini. Anyone can speak about religion. Whoever you see can speak about the 'Gita'. Whoever you see can become like Krishna. There are no rules for this. But even in music, when there is so much classicality, think about how much classicality must have been established religion Supreme Being. But in this matter, you should also have authority, so to accept authority, it is said here that a person should be a Brahmin. Being a Brahmin means knowing and accepting the Brahman, who is beyond human understanding, who is a twice-born, who is a Dvija, who is born again. Even a bird is called a Dvija, whose birth happens for the second time. Now, just as the birth of a bird happens, first, it is in an egg-like form, it becomes like an egg, and then when its Brahmarandhra bursts or let's say when the mother bird breaks it with its beak, then it is born again. Similarly, when a human becomes twice-born, when he is born for the second time, only then is he called a Brahmin. But nowadays, being a Brahmin means that you can hire someone. You can hire a Brahmin, you can find a priest for hire. You cannot call them Brahmins. The meaning of Christian  is also the same. The meaning of Christian  is that which is baptized, that which is baptized means that whose Brahmarandhra bursts, that person is considered a Christian. But how many Christians are there like this? Or does the meaning of Muslim identity for Muslims also remain the same? This is the case for any caste, even for Parsi people.

If you read the Zoroaster, it also talks about becoming a twice-born, meaning you must know the Supreme Being and be reborn. But until that happens, until you don't have that power within you or you are not that, you are not entitled to engage in religious matters. You cannot handle religious matters on your own. Many people told me yesterday, 'Mother, we read books and practiced yoga.' That's not correct. Just as you cannot fix a fan by reading a book, how can you handle the living thing called a human being? You must have the authority over it. If you have not awakened yourself within, then you cannot say, 'We can awaken others.' Those who are themselves in a dormant state, how can they awaken others? Those who are blind themselves, how can they lead others? Therefore, one should understand the mechanism or the scholarly method of it. Now, understand one thing: If I want to operate this fan, I simply tell them to switch it on because I want to use the fan. It's a very straightforward thing. If someone from the village comes, they might say, "Hey, this is just a game for them. They pressed a button and the fan started running. How is that possible?" But this seemingly simple thing, which we can call a game, behind it, there is some heavy machinery, some engineering involved for sure. Besides that, there is a significant power behind it, the whole powerhouse is running. Ages have been spent in making that powerhouse and preparing it. Ages were spent in bringing the concept of electricity, what it is. Then, after going somewhere, this small fan was ready. Similarly, for a human being, one has to think that if they are reaching a higher state, then behind it, there is some heavy engineering involved. And that engineering is living. It thinks, understands, and also loves you.

We cannot imagine a power that thinks, understands, and loves. We love it. After all, where do we love from? If there is no water in this ocean, then where from will it come in the clouds, and how will it rain? If there were no source for it, where would we love from? There must be some power somewhere that loves. The power that is within us is extremely subtle and resides within us. The way it resides, its mechanism, I am going to tell you about it today. Although this subject was considered quite mysterious and secretive until today. People used to say that it's not for everyone to know. It's only meant for a few people. And very few people can surpass it. There is a very prominent saint here, in Maharashtra, who knows about us. And he told some people, "Mother is like this, and that she is incarnation." So some of our disciples went to meet him. So he said, "We all respect Mother, but we don't understand how she can elevate ordinary people like you in just one or two minutes? We have been practicing for thousands of years. We have been meditating since you were a frog; whereafter then Vibrations started within us. Why did Mother give you this?" When I met him, he asked me the same question, "We come from the jungle and you have given them to these people, and not only that, you keep them protected. They live in ordinary society and live in joy." "So what is such in these people that you have given them?" The reason is that the end time of Kali Yuga has come. Kali Yuga is ending, and now the beginning of Satya Yuga has begun. And since the beginning of Satya Yuga has started, there is a need for people who understand, know, thrive in Satya Yuga, and enjoy its bliss. The time has come for the start of this new era.

Therefore, the work is happening. Speaking about, those who have practiced for years, who knows, they may be sitting here today as ordinary people. After the tales of Nala and Damayanti, once Nala met Kali somewhere. So he caught Kali and said, "You have done great injustice to me, and I will definitely take revenge on you." So Kali said, "Alright, if you want to take revenge on me, then go ahead, but first listen to my greatness. Why did I come into this world? What is the greatness of Kali?" He said, "When Kali Yuga comes, when my evilness becomes extreme, when the distress in the world becomes unbearable, and when the earth cries, at that time there will be such a miracle that those who are searching for the Divine in the caves, they will come into the world in an ordinary form, and they will receive the answer to their search, they will find it. It will be available to them." This is a promise given to you. And for this reason, when this thing happens, there is no need to doubt it. Because this plan has already been made. If this is happening to you, then it is happening in your favor. You should have no doubts about this. Instead, I am talking about being fully established in your rights. About Kundalini, whether someone fears to talk about it or not, I am not afraid at all. Because when it comes to your mother, what's there to fear about telling everything! It doesn't make sense to me why there should be any fear in talking about it. And you will also see for yourself what is there to fear about it. It doesn't make any sense to me whether human minds are corrupted or why it is kept so secretive to tell them about their mother? The subtle Kundalini that resides within us is the triangular bone I have shown. There, in the six and a half chakras, the three and a half coils, also called Kundalins in English, the Kundalini is situated. Kundalini is made up of many threads, and those threads are interwoven together. When Kundalini rises, not all threads rise. Some threads rise, then some threads rise, and then some threads rise. When so many threads rise from it that it pierces through your Brahmarandhra, then at that moment, the state you achieve, which is called transcending, that state is reached. Everyone has their Kundalini, so I call it 'natural', 'natural'. 'Sah' means with you, 'j' means born. Born with you. This superior yoga is with you, and you attain it. But it's not like anyone can see it and say, 'It's all natural', just as Kabir Dasji said. He said, 'Sahib Sahaj Yoga hai, isme kya karte hain!' ‘You stand up with your heads down,' Then it is said that Sahaja Yoga has happened. If something is born with you, then it is yours. You have complete ownership over it. It is entirely your own thing. And it happens on its own. Imagine if it becomes difficult for you to breathe and it becomes so unnatural that you can't even breathe. And that's why the most important thing is that your evolution, your evolution should also happen extremely naturally. The happening should be extremely natural. This is absolutely evident. If it's not natural and it's unnatural, then this action can never happen. Look at the trees, when flowers turn into fruits, how effortlessly they appear to you. Now whether Kundalini is situated in your triangular bone or not, or Mother is just saying it. So, I can show you. At the time when some people hold the navel chakra of others, at that time especially this Kundalini rises forcefully. When someone touches my feet, Kundalini senses that someone authoritative is in front, then you can see with your own eyes that there is a vibration of Kundalini. Because humans have to first convinced.

So, Kundalini rises forcefully on its own and you can see with your own eyes, Kundalini rises. If someone is a doctor, they can hear with a stethoscope, they can hear that there is the sound of Kundalini. It means like Anahata, as it comes in the heart. So, just like the sound of 'dhak-dhak' comes in our heart, similarly, the sound that comes in the triangular bone of our spine, in our back, comes with great force.

Then, as Kundalini rises gradually, if you observe it with a steady mind, you will see something like an upward movement. Not only that, but if you place a stethoscope on the various Kundalini centres made here for, you will also see that when Kundalini reaches there, you hear a sound. But a Sahaja Yogi already knows where his Kundalini has come? Where has it reached? That's another matter. Even when you haven't transcended, you can see the Kundalini sitting in this triangular bone. Still, if you tell any doctor about it, but again the 'three legs of a goat', they will say, 'No, it can't be like that. It could be breathing.' Have you seen anywhere such a small place for breathing? But 'the three legs of a goat'. They insist, 'No sir, we only have three legs of a goat.' Now, when I go to America, this year American doctors arranged a conference for me, but I avoided it. Because what will I tell them about Ganapati? I thought about what I would tell them about religion. Doctors in our own country need to understand that this is our heritage, we need to educate our people about those people. As for me, there they will first break my head. What we call in Marathi, "varsa." What should we explain to them first? I'll explain Ganapati to them first. After that, they will understand everything, and the doctors here will perform Ganapati puja at home and bow before Ganapati, but if I say that Ganapati controls your pelvic plexus, they will say, 'What are you saying, Mother!' Our science is English science. Do not associate it with Ganapati. Was English science also born only in England! Sometimes, the attitude of doctors in Hindustan does not make sense to me. However, when there was a discussion at the medical institute, people definitely came to this conclusion because there are many educated people, and those people came to the conclusion that Mother should be heard. And if possible, something can be done in this matter, students are also coming from there to study. Anyway, whatever it is, you can see for yourself that Kundalini vibrates in the triangular bone. This is the most important thing settled in the mechanism inside you, this Kundalini seated in the triangular bone. We know this Kundalini by the name of Gauri. Now, both our scriptures should go together. For this, you forgive me. If you are a scientist, you should know that if you are a scientist, then science, too, Gauri ji, has come from the Supreme. Every particle of creation is also made by him. Gauri ji, whom we consider, is the embodiment of power, and at this moment, she is unmarried. And now she has married Shiva ji and has gone to bathe. The time considered at that time, symbolically here, is still the time of Kundalini, as she sits there quietly. This is quite poetic to understand because all behaviour is like a human. It's not like you press a button and electricity runs because electricity doesn't think, it doesn't understand, and it doesn't love you. If you touch it wrongly, it will burn you. But Kundalini, which is your like tape-recorder, has all the tapes of past lives in this Kundalini. And the reflection of God in your heart, who is the witness, is from the soul. Understand God and his power as two things. When God and power become one, then it becomes Brahma, and when power separates from God, then God and power become two things. Power is the one who does all the work, and God is its witness. He sees it. All this play is to be seen by God. He is the spectator, He is the witness. Understand this work for His pleasure. The day they don't like it, they will stop it. And she sits in our heart as Shiva and in the form of the soul. And understand a tiny spark or light in your heart. Kundalini, which is this power, transforms into three parts of power. Because when someone needs to perform a task, the power is divided into three parts. Now, see how we are using electricity in three ways. When we say this, it takes sound waves. The fan gives air. The light gives light. Power is also transformed into three forms. And the whole world is made up of these three parts. Now someone will say, what proof is there for this? We will also show you proof in our Kundalini awakening. There are three types of powers within us. Now if you give it an English name, people think it's correct. But if I give my old name, people say, "What is this, Mataji talking about, village type stuff?" Because we are still moving in that slavery that everything should be in English. So first explain it in English. What I talked about in the autocrated  system yesterday, which we call the left and right sympathetic nervous system. And in between, the parasympathetic nervous system, which is visible to us outside, the subtle form that is within, the power that is going on inside it, the name of those powers is only in our scriptures, what can we do abot it?  And if something is subtle, mentioned in the Sanskrit language, does it become false, and if it is in English, does it become correct! Because you people have read English first and never read Sanskrit, and will never read it either. Therefore, whatever is written in the Sanskrit language will be falsified! Here, we know it by the three holy names of Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, and Mahasaraswati. Here, these powers are not called the parasympathetic nervous system, etc. The reason for this is that these powers think for themselves, act, and love. When you call it a sympathetic system, it means that some power does not think at all. It does not love either. You see these three powers here because I have seen that they are subtle in nature. Now, Mr. Wardrobe has written such a big book on Kundalini, he does not even know that the bones of our spine, within which there are subtle channels, these channels are in subtle form inside, and the gross ones that we see with our eyes, plexus, etc., are visible outside. He doesn't even know about the powers that operate them. He's so confused, he's written such a big book. I don't understand. These subtle powers are behind, they are not visible, but what is visible outside is the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. The powers that operate them are within us. And these three powers are - Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, and Mahasaraswati. We find the power of Mahakali in humans on the channel or the nerve on which Mahakali is, we call it the Ida Nadi. Each name also has meanings. And what we call Mahasaraswati, she moves on the Pingala Nadi. And the one that is in between, which is related to the parasympathetic nervous system or the one that is operated by the parasympathetic, we call that nerve the Sushumna Nadi. Now these are names in Sanskrit, they are not in English. If they were, I would tell you. Because they haven't seen this. They haven't contemplated on this. They are not delving into its roots. They are witnessing the growth of the tree, but they are not delving into its roots. All the hard work has been done in the roots in our country, what can we do? These Ida Nadi, Pingala Nadi, and Sushumna Nadi are within you, and you can also know it if you become a Sahaj Yogi, then you will be amazed that within you there is balance from these three nerves. The first nerve, which you call the Ida Nadi, from that nerve or from the power of Mahakali, you can do all the emotional work of the world. You are in a position. Whatever experiences you gather from all the things of the world, so much experience is there which is called conditioning nowadays. Meaning, as in psychology, they have coined the term conditioning, that whatever comes from within us, whatever is from the past, from past lives, because in today's sciences, there is no talk of past lives, but whatever is from many births, it all comes from within us through this same nerve, and in this same nerve, the Kundalini, which is a part of us, becomes known. This nerve passes above the heart. There, the supreme form of your soul, God, is manifested. The form of God, which is present within us as a witness, sees whatever you see, whatever you are doing, whatever you are doing right now, whatever you are thinking, whatever you have done, whatever you have gained from the present, it observes all of that through this and makes a note of it in the Kundalini. And whatever is of this life is also observed through this, and it accumulates on the left-hand side of yours. Your entire past is on the left-hand side. Now, along with this, consider that your subconscious mind is there, and after the subconscious mind, there is your collective subconscious mind. Whatever is yours, whatever is the world's, moves on the left-hand side. Now, whether this is true or not, we will show you through Kundalini later. You can verify this through experiments. Sahaja Yoga is the most practical thing. You can see for yourself that if your left side is disturbed, you are emotionally disturbed. If your right side is disturbed, you are physically disturbed, and if the upper part of your right side is disturbed, then you are mentally disturbed. This is our daily experience. Thousands of people today, you will see tomorrow, how many people I have told that their throat is bad, their stomach is bad, their liver is bad, do they have this problem, is their wife dead? How am I saying all these things? Because their nerve is caught, and their nerve is caught because these are the causes in their life. Now, apart from these three nerves, there are seven chakras inside us, among which there is a special chakra at the bottom, which is below the Kundalini. This is a special thing in humans, this special chakra, which we call the Muladhara Chakra because where the Kundalini is, it is called the Muladhara. This is the mother's house. But below the Muladhara, the Muladhara Chakra is situated below, where Lord Ganesha is seated. Now people will say, 'Mother, how can you say that Lord Ganesha is seated?' Is Lord Ganesha there or not? He is there. Understand that someone has a disease of the prostate gland. The functioning of the prostate gland is through Lord Ganesha because this chakra operates the pelvic plexus. And the pelvic plexus controls the prostate gland. If your prostate gland is malfunctioning, then if someone is a Sahaja Yogi, it won't happen with every person, but if someone is a Sahaja Yogi and they take the name of Ganesha, then Ganesha becomes awakened there, and their prostate gland gets cured. But the meaning of the prostate gland being bad is also that you have done something against Ganesha. Now, for example, let me tell you. In Pune, we have a very well known Sahaja Yogi now, Mr. Rajwade. You may have heard the name Agnihotri Rajwade, it's the same. He is their son. And they have many auspicious activities, etc., very grand. And when I went there, they had already scheduled my program for an auspicious activity. And then they said, 'Mother is not a Brahmin. So we won't do it here.' Then people said, 'Hey, don't do this, otherwise, you will get a bad reputation that you only give place to Brahmins.' And this announcement has been made in the newspaper now. So they agreed. No one told me anything. These people don't tell everything that's happening. Just like that. As I was speaking, I said, 'Whoever among you is a Brahmin, come forward.' So four or five members of their committee came and sat in front of me. So I felt amused. I said, 'Look at these Brahmins.' And as soon as I started raising their Kundalini, they started trembling like that. So I said, 'Why are you trembling so much in front of me?' They started saying, 'Because you are power, that's why we are trembling.' I said, 'Others are feeling a cool breeze, and why are you trembling? If I am powerful, you should feel a cool breeze too. And those who are trembling, they must have gone mad recently, they are also trembling like this, and you are also trembling. Your and their category becomes the same; Relatively, you see. And you call yourselves Brahmins.' But as soon as I said this, Mr. Rajwade's entire body, arthritis completely seized him, and he was sitting upstairs in the gallery, suddenly his body broke down. He completely collapsed, and then he came down and touched my feet, and since then, he has been my disciple. But his prostate gland is bad. Now, these are big worshippers of Ganesha. When they came to meet me, they started saying, 'Mother, everything of mine, my prostate is bad. How is this possible? I am a great worshipper of Ganesha, from ancient times.' I said, 'Okay!' So I said, 'Let's eat chickpeas.' Then the other person started saying, 'Today we won't eat.' I said, 'Why?' They said, 'Today is their religious restriction. 'I said, 'That's why your prostate is bad.' They started saying, 'Is that why it's bad? I don't even eat during their worship.' I said, 'The day of religious restriction was born. If a child is born in your house, what should you do on that day? Think about it. This is a great insult to them. Use your brain. And you have insulted them. And because of this. Today, promise me in front of me that on the day of religious restriction, you will eat, drink, and enjoy yourself. Because Shri Ganesha was born in your house.' Immediately their prostate became fine and their scheduled operation was abandoned. Now, see how subtle sensitivity is. It's a very subtle matter, but it doesn't enter the gross mind of a person. It becomes very difficult for them to understand this. But this is the truth. If you fast on the day of religious restriction, you do a great wrong. Think for yourself, use your brain. You have a brain. Who introduced this tradition of fasting on the day of religious restriction? Nobody even asks.' Therefore, I say that when something becomes customary, we accept it blindly. If I say there should be fasting for only one day, it should be on Naraka Chaturdashi because the gates of hell open that day. On that day, people wake up at four in the morning and there is festivity in our Maharashtra. It's organized. Many such errors we have made in our religion, fasting on the wrong days and not fasting on the right ones, due to which even Shri Ganesha is displeased with us. Furthermore, Shri Ganesha himself is a forever child. He is unaware of sex, completely oblivious, like there was a gentleman here, he used to take off all the women's clothes. So I asked him, 'In what context are you taking off everyone's clothes?' He said, 'I am Shri Krishna and these are all gopis. I am undressing them.' I said, 'Wow, brother! Is your age only four years like Shri Krishna's, who undressed their clothes?' And at the time when Draupadi's clothing was stripped, if Krishna had not considered the dignity of a woman, then why did 'there was a commotion in Dwarka, the sound of conch shells, chakra, mace, lotus, and Garuda were all ringing out'? So why did He reach there with these four powers? Shri Krishna did not have the thought of a woman's dignity? And nowadays, many have come out saying, "We are Shri Krishna and all others are gopis, and there is no need for marriage. Let it be as it is." That means they are fundamentally damaging their entire religion. People have engaged in undermining it completely from its roots. In this way, they insult Shri Krishna, but people like Shri Ganesha, who is the holiest person, who is the holiest symbol within us, created by the Supreme God, is the most sacred. That is because when you sit in the worship of God, then in the matter of sex, you keep a child in front of a child. And those who say to sublimate sex, talk about sex, and make people naked, these people are committing all sorts of unrighteousness and are also leading you to unrighteousness. And those who have gone to these people, their Kundalini will not awaken. Because why have you accepted such things? This is your mother, Gauri. You are insulting her. If you are putting sex on her, then you should know what feelings you have towards your mother. The feeling of that sanctity will have to be completely awakened again in this country. Then only the Satyayuga will be established here. Otherwise, it will not be established.

We people go in extreme opposition to Ganesh. The opposition to Ganesh has been there for years, in our society, especially in Hindustan. This may have happened because to err is human. I think this because since birth, I have understood where humans have misconceived. How they might have unnoticed Ganesha? So I found out, in contemplation, that it is possible that when they went into contemplation, and when they started seeing from the parasympathetic and when they saw this chakra, it is possible that they may have understood the trunk of Ganesh ji, it is possible that they may have understood the same as Gauriji, may have understood Kundalini. I say this as a mother because I cannot tolerate that from the beginning, a human can be so disgusting as to think such dirty things. That is why I think it is possible. But its downfall reached such an extent in this country by the sixth century. You will be surprised that tantrics have used it very badly. Now what is a short way of this, if you understand, if a symbol is placed as God here, then the attention of God comes there. If that form is correct, now if the consciousness of God is there, and if you go there and commit adultery in front of that idol, then that consciousness of God moves away from there. This is absolutely true. Let me tell you, if someone brings my photo and asks me, I can immediately tell what filth you've done in front of it. His mind, my mind, sees it from there. Similarly, from there, the attention of God moves away. In the case of Ganesh or Hanumanji, it's like this, they first offer salvation, Bhairavnath gives salvation, troubles, heats them up, shoots, everything. Even then if a person doesn't correct and insult such sacred things, at that time, when such a thing happens, that place becomes deprived of God. And whenever a poet asks to show a place where there is no God, such a place becomes where the attention of God doesn't reside, and there every kind of adultery starts. There are many such temples and many dirty places here. People have exerted their influence on every temple. Like in the temple of Mahalakshmi, let me tell you, if someone performs ghostly activities there, throwing rocks, as they say, from there the mind of Mahalakshmi will completely move away. Because Lakshmi will not stay for a minute in a house where ghosts reside. So they made it balanced, and I told the trustees here, 'Remove such people from there.' So they said, 'This is just a form of public entertainment, Mother. "We will remove it, then who will ask Mahalakshmi?" I say, "What's happening now is absolutely disgraceful! Let's do 5 or 6." Doing such ghostly behaviours at that place, bringing ghosts there, and asking them, 'Which horse will win?' These kinds of filthy things, when you are directly in the temple of Mahalakshmi, who is present. The idol of Mahalakshmi here, She is present. I have awakened Her a thousand times by going there. And you people keep downgrading it repeatedly. So this kind of thing happens there every year. People engage in these activities here every Navratri. And those who go there, someone's head gets caught, someone goes insane. Just now you read that someone went to a temple, and there he went mad. How can someone go mad in a temple? But if you people engage in such wrong behaviour there, then this will happen. We have arranged to completely eradicate all the these temples. Then set up shops outside nicely. Shirdi's Sai Baba was very big. He is an incarnation of Dattatreya, there is no doubt about it. He is a guru, venerable, but when I went to Shirdi this time, I lost six hours, but I couldn't awaken them. They left from there. By doing all kinds of wrong deeds, we are annoying these deities sitting on top. I've just told you about Shri Ganesh. By the grace of God, you are Indian and you have a lot of respect for mother and sister. Understand, it's the grace of God, it's the power of this earth, which keeps magnificent things like India alive on this earth, where such vibrations exist, which still enable humans to recognize mother and sister. For this, thank God very much and say, 'Lord, keep our vision always like this.' Keep your gaze on the ground. Look, your Ganesh ji should remain peaceful. Always keep your vision grounded because these Ganesh ji created are made of earth elements. The wheel you see above it is called the navel chakra. It is located in the spine behind the navel bone, whether it is anywhere, the human navel can be a little above or below, it is not fixed. There is the navel chakra. And through this chakra, as you know, due to the navel chakra, what is called the solar plexus operates our entire system, whatever food, whatever processes take place, they all happen through this plexus, the solar plexus. And it controls it.

But it's very subtle; it's inherited from your mother, it's connected to your mother. Understand, if someone's mother is unwell, the navel chakra will be affected. It will catch on the left side. If someone eats the wrong kind of food somewhere, it's related to eating because food, meaning, initially, we receive nourishment from our mother's milk and learn to eat from our mother, so its connection is related to eating.

If you go to someone's house and you eat food and then you vomit, understand that there were negative vibes in that person's house, something bad was there, which you expelled. The navel chakra inside your stomach is associated with your religion, establishes your religion. So, imagine it's a small thing that someone says, 'What's there to see in it? Who will go to see a cabaret?' You'll be surprised that although I've never seen a cabaret, but my husband has such a job. Sometimes, they start and at that moment, my condition gets so bad due to my vomiting that everything, including the cabaret, seems cold. I have my religion in my stomach; I don't say many things like 'Baba, don't drink alcohol, it's bad.' I don't rationalize. I can't even drink alcohol. Once someone mistakenly gave me a little brandy without telling me. So much blood flowed. Since then, whenever my husband goes somewhere, he says, 'Baba, don't give her even a drop by mistake.' I get anxious. This stomach has religion in it. It balances everything. You see, all the diseases of the stomach come from alcohol and all intoxicants. Nanak has said that drinking alcohol is prohibited. Muhammad said that drinking alcohol is prohibited.

In the end, those people were crazy who outright refused to drink alcohol. But now, look at how we get confused in matters of religion. Right now, we can see two people who have clearly said. Not everyone said everything. But religion is formed by everyone's contribution. But they have completely prohibited alcohol and intoxicants, that no kind of intoxication should be consumed. Absolutely prohibited, complete abstinence. But you see that Muslims drink the most alcohol. And when you go to their countries, you find poets one after another. They have composed poetry about alcohol. Alcohol was not created by God for drinking. It was created for polish, for polishing anything, whether it's a diamond or furniture, it needs to be polished, and it requires spirit. All alcohol was made for that purpose. Man is so foolish that he started drinking it. Now he becomes addicted to it, and after that, the person who rises cannot be human anymore. And now if he cannot even be God, then will he become a demon or not? That's why it is said that some people become demons. Drinking alcohol makes a person lose consciousness. And when you have to realize God within your consciousness, then what's the use of drinking alcohol that makes you lose your consciousness? You shouldn't do anything without thinking about it from within why you should consume such filthy things. Now, look at drugs. People have started taking drugs.

In the UK, where all our disciples used to drink drugs, I have now made them all quit. After Sahaja Yoga, it's very easy for alcohol, drugs, and everything to be given up. But now drugs have started. Now your children will drink drugs tomorrow. Now you drink alcohol, and your children will drink drugs. Their children, who knows what they will drink? And then they'll say that the gods used to drink Soma juice. If Soma juice was impure, why do you drink it? Their downfall happened because of this, and your downfall will also happen because of this. If you want to walk on the path of the gods, why go on the path of downfall? Those who have risen, who haven't even touched alcohol, should go there. You should create your own ideals. And the so precious life of this holy, beautiful human being should be valued. Even if you don't have faith in yourself, your importance, your identity, how high we are, and we will talk about such foolishness, which is an item for polishing, we are consuming it. Absolutely, it was made for polish. Similarly, tobacco, the thing it is, you call it tobacco. This is also a demon. It is a demon born in plants. Plants are demonic. And tobacco was made for this, it is an insecticide. It was made as an insecticide for all the insects worldwide." Now they started eating it, and we started drinking it. Now cancer has started happening because of it. In London, it's clearly written on everyone's bottle that 'It causes cancer. Don't drink it.' Yet people drink it. Now I don't understand, why people drink it when it's clearly shown that it shouldn't be consumed. It has become a fashion, this thing has become fashionable. I mean, wherever a person stands, whether he sees himself or not, whether he knows who he is? You have to become kings. You have to bring dominance over yourself. Understand what you are. That is, you have to make yourself a garbage collector. Tomorrow you will meet someone lying on the road. I have been living here in Bombay for about 24-25 years. I have seen people around us. Found someone on the road, found someone dying there, heard such things, it surprised me. Scholars, good people of the house, everyone speaks, they were gentlemen on the road, found them, picked them up, and threw them in the garbage. What are you doing with your lives, you great people? That's why all these things have been forbidden on the navel chakra by the Gurus. And these Gurus, we call them wide, ocean, they are also inside us, in our stomachs, they are born there. There are ten main incarnations of them. We take them like this, that Adinath, who is considered by the Jains, was the first incarnation of it. Dattatreya is its essence, its principle, Dattatreya is its principle. Dattatreya, who is the embodiment of these three powers, is the divine form, and after him, there have been countless incarnations, among which King Janak is one. You know about his daughter Sita Ji, the primordial power. But there was another incarnation of him elsewhere, which you do not know. The incarnation of King Janak also occurred in the form of Prophet Muhammad. And the daughter of Prophet Muhammad, whom we know as Fatima B, She herself was the incarnation of Sita Ji. And their two sons were also no one else but Hasan and Husain. And Hasan, Husain were born earlier as Mahavir and Buddha. Now, you do not know this, but I am a mother, I know. And you will also know when you descend into the Kundalini. The son-in-law of Prophet Muhammad, whom you recognize as Hazrat Ali and about whom you have heard, he was the only one, only once, when Brahma took incarnation in the world, it happened only once as Hazrat Ali. Now you will be amazed. A Muslim gentleman came to us and he had a complaint in his stomach, which we say was in the place of Brahma in the Swadhisthana chakra and it was caught on the left side, so the name of the incarnation had to be taken on the left side. So we were sitting with a Sahaja Yogi. So I said, 'His left side is caught. Now what treatment can be done for this?' So he said, 'Mother, you once said that Brahma took incarnation as Hazrat Ali.' I said, 'Yes,' I said, 'Okay, let's take the name of Hazrat Ali. And as soon as his name was mentioned, suddenly, if he were present here, he could tell you. Suddenly his Kundalini awakened, and he transcended, and his complaint disappeared. Now someone there in Pune says, 'Mother is preaching the Muslim religion.' Oh, what Muslim, what Hindu, and aren't they all created by the same God! And all these major incarnations are related to each other. We are the ones quarrelling among ourselves. Christ also said, 'He who is not against me is with me.' Who is he? He also lived among fools for three, four years. They caught him and hanged him. Now here you believe in Sai Baba's photo, who was himself a Muslim. And that is the incarnation, Sai Baba is also no one else. Then why do you believe in him?"

Whoever is a Muslim, whoever it may be, when they are at the feet of the Supreme Being and when they transcend, they become vulnerable to everyone, especially in this country, like Khwaja Nizamuddin Sahab. They were transcendent beings, and that Khilji, a donkey king troubled them so much; in the end, he himself died. But they were the ones who are elevated, whether they are Muslim, Hindu, or anyone else, they are always worshipped in this land of India.

And if you are the people of this Bharat Varsha, and you are the residents of this Bharat Varsha, then you should know that in this country, small things are not ignored, and big things are not trivialized. Then, no one here is left unattended in the garbage. This is like a diamond. What is a diamond, it is a diamond. Whether it is born in any caste, and which caste is there that considers itself the biggest and the best. This castism, has even acquired has disturbed the Supreme Being. In Marathi, it means to be khobaram kiyal devacha! means to be done well by God! Now it has come to the point that first we were from Bombay, then in Bombay, we were Muslims, some were Hindus, some were Christians, and now we have become builders. Now even among the builders, some have become garland makers. Is a human being created to be smaller and smaller? We should consider the ocean as a symbol for this Chakra. The ocean is its symbol. When this Chakra becomes defective, understand that the vastness of the ocean within you has become completely restricted. If cancer of the stomach happens to someone, then they should know that stomach cancer happens due to these wrong beliefs. Understand that if someone is a Muslim. Recently there was an incident. There is a Muslim doctor. They came to me. He had stomach cancer. They are residents of Iran. So I told them, 'Look, you have come to me for treatment. But are you a staunch Muslim?' Although there are not many staunch Muslims in Iran. So he said, 'Yes, I am. And I don't believe in anything .' So I said, 'Will you believe in Dattatreya?' He started saying, 'No, no, I can't believe in him.' So I said, 'If you can't believe in Dattatreya, then I can't help you. If all these incarnations are of Dattatreya, then you have to believe in one hand and not the other. Can they believe that?' I said, 'You have to believe in Dattatreya.' He said, 'No, no, we can't believe in it. What you are saying, Mother, it's quite wrong.' I said, 'Okay, fine, you go.' After that, he went. Then he arrived in London, saying, 'Mother, somehow get them treated.' If they get cancer, then they get scared. They said, 'Whatever you say.' I said, 'Come on.' I did Tilak to him. I said, 'Come on.' I joined my hands and recited the mantra of Dattatreya to them. And after that, today he is fine by the grace of God. This happens to many people. When we worship Dattatreya a lot and if we abuse Prophet Muhammad, then understand that although you acknowledge the essence of Prophet Muhammad, if you abuse his incarnations, then Prophet Muhammad himself is displeased with you, and Dattatreya is completely upset with you too, thinking, 'They are so foolish. Why don't they understand that what I have been saying, they are saying the same thing, and even Nanak is saying the same thing.' Nanak came to elevate Hindus and Muslims in the world. But look at the condition of his disciples today. Look at what kind of venom we are spreading, saying, 'No, don't spare them, finish them off, do this to them.' Who are you to kill anyone? Did you create even an ant in this world to spread such hatred and then start killing it, beating it, all in the name of religion? You are human. To forgive this human, you need the heart of a mother. I don't understand in what arrogance you are doing all this work and how blindly you are walking into darkness. The nature of vastness is on your navel chakra. The person in whom this vastness comes does not get caught in the navel chakra. And there are other faults in it, there are many faults. In this, there are ten of their branches. And from that, you can see that there are only ten complexes in the solar plexus. Although they see the physical side in the solar plexus. "We don't see his emotional side, but the navel chakra is very important. When you go to someone's house to eat, then you teach them emotions, what to eat? Now if you have to recognize a demon, he eats more than necessary. He eats a lot. Or he doesn't eat at all. He remains hungry because he only eats hunger. I don't know what he does. Those who eat excessively and those who eat very little are both not okay. They are in between. They eat whatever they get. In terms of eating, many people in our country are very interested. They will go home and ask their wives, 'Yes, Bhai, what did you cook?' Women will keep thinking from morning till evening about what to make in the evening that will satisfy the man's stomach. He should sit at home and not go to the office. The idea of ​​eating and drinking here is that it has been told that one should not eat more food, not even less. It should be eaten properly. That's why it is said that your navel chakra should remain balanced. But it has not been told for the variety of vegetarianism that people do all kinds of things. It has not been told for fasting that you should keep thinking day and night about what to eat. What will I eat in the evening? Today is my fast, what will I eat today? It has not been made for that.

In reality, I tell all the Sahaj Yogis, 'Baba, don't fast.' It goes against my mind. I am not pleased with it. Yes, if you don't want to eat, then have something else. Change its quality. But those who fast, sitting on a fast from morning till evening, today, sir, you are sitting on a fast. Those people can't cross over, I tell you. If you are on a fast, you cannot transcend. You should know that if you get God by fasting, then at least 30-40% of the people in your country should have transcended like this. Who told these foolish things? On the contrary, if God has given something, you should gratefully accept it, eat it with a joyful heart, and live happily. When you live like this, when you work like this, you will see that God will also be pleased with you, and the whole world will also be pleased with you. But even at that time, you fast when it is time to glorify God. When it is time to glorify God, why do you fast then? There are many other things regarding eating and drinking here that we talk about, like we don't eat garlic. You should not eat garlic if your blood pressure is low. If your blood pressure is high, then you should definitely eat garlic. Every single thing has its own rule. Its that I had been to that place and their she doesn’t eat greens so I also don’t eat. Oh! Bhai! Why not you eat?  It's like we abandoned wisdom first. You don't find God through eating and drinking. Instead, if you focus too much on eating and drinking, surely you will lose touch with God. Being busy with eating and drinking day and night also affects the Nabhi chakra. Now, many people say, 'Mother, how can, those who don't even get enough to eat, go towards God?' People ask me this question in every country. And when I speak to many people, They should improve you people who are sitting in the city today.But until you transcend, until your powers are awakened, you can't fix those things. But this is used as an excuse. It's hidden behind and said, 'Mother, until people's conditions improve...' What's your condition? You're travelling in cars. Eating comfortably and saying that we should improve the condition of the poor. If a hungry person came to me and said such a thing, I could accept it. But I've never seen a poor person raise such an issue. Here, many people from very poor families come to our place from Kalva, and whenever they come, they bring some flowers. I said, 'Why do you spend so much?' They come with so much love, and there are so many loving people. Just now, when I went to their place for the program, where I came from in my car, they had lit up all the way with lights, and when I reached there, all the lights and so many village people, thousands of people, had reached there with so much love. My heart was so full. I said, 'Why did you spend so much?' I told our organizers, 'Baba, give them double the money they spent. They spent so much, give them the money.' They started saying, 'Mother, we didn't spend a penny. When people found out that you were coming, this gentleman arranged for us, he arranged that, he decorated this mandap himself. "Come, Mother, bless us." I've never seen them asking us, "Give us food, give us drink. Mother, give us God." They are asking for it, and you people are running in the opposite direction. The day you transcend, you will attain this yourself. This is the place where Lord Vishnu and Lakshmi reside. And when this awakening happens, you will be amazed. I tell you what happened with the people of Kalva. I told them, 'Bhai, you bring flowers for me every day, why do you spend so much?' It saddens me a lot.' And I've always seen them coming with a garland. I said, 'Son, it costs a lot of money. Don't bring it.' They said, 'No, Mother, we can't tell you what a big miracle happened with us. After we transcended, the next day a man came to us in the morning. A Sindhi man came and said that your land is very good and we will make tiles from this soil. Will you sell it to us?' And every day they come, pick up the soil and give us a lot of money." When the Lakshmi within them awakened, what value did money hold? Money meaning Wealth came to you. If you transcend, then the goddess Lakshmi herself awakens within you. People from your side, Sahaj Yogis can tell that even those who didn't have jobs had plenty of money. The reason for this is that the goddess Lakshmi must awaken within you. Now, the meaning of Lakshmi is not just money. Lakshmi means contentment. A kind of contentment comes within a person. I see millionaires coming to me, millionaires, but they say, 'Mother, please come to our house. They are starting a business here. It will go well with your blessings.' They still think that more money will come. And I said, 'Income tax is already causing trouble, why are you opening more businesses? It will bring more trouble.' 'No problem, Mother, we'll manage that.' This is not about money. Money means contentment. Money means the happiness of Lakshmi. Mother Lakshmi herself has charity in one hand and shelter in the other. There are lotus flowers in both hands, meaning the person who has Lakshmi is like a lotus, full of love and pink lotus. Love can be there. If you go to his house, there should be a kind of cosiness within him. When you sit in his house, love should overflow from within him. I consider him wealthy whose home is always open. I am telling you what my father said, which legendary people will think about. My father's house would remain open twenty-four hours a day, morning and night. They were also enlightened people. They used to say, I don't know when, who might get lost or stray and need water, if someone needs something, let them come inside. And at our father's place, there was never any theft, never. And whatever belongings our house had were all communal. Meaning, whatever carpets were there would be taken outside for needy people, and that brought him joy. Then it was never remembered who was given the carpet in the previous wedding. All their belongings would keep roaming outside. And these would sometimes come home. Mostly, he kept wandering. He went to their house, brought something from there, went to their house, brought something from there. He never knew that whatever he had should be considered wealth. He should enjoy his wealth with his own children and sit and enjoy it. Never. And the same thing I see today, that this thought comes to the minds of our capitalist people that this is not something for us to enjoy alone. But if shared with the whole society, all societal issues will disappear at once. They should be wealthy. They shouldn't just have money. Nobody asks the wealthy. Nobody knows them. His children are not respected by anyone. Until you are not against to us and in cooperation this is completely capitalism because your full power is awakened and this is completely communism. Because its distribution has to be done. This is where both things come together. And this happens with the awakening of your navel chakra, that humans gather all the power completely and until the power is not distributed completely. Like yesterday I was here till quarter to eleven and a gentleman came at ten o'clock and started saying, 'Mother, now you go home, it's very late for you.' But within me, there was so much vibration of the power that I said no, I will distribute this first.' Otherwise, I'll keep standing here. Children in my house sometimes say it's two o'clock, sometimes it's three o'clock. I never feel tired. Day and night, I enjoy so much that I keep giving. Because I have found so much. And therefore, I give. If I hadn't found it, I wouldn't give. But I have found it in many things. And found it so much, so abundantly that I want to give completely. When such a person becomes aware, Lakshmi, understands the word Lakshmi, I'm not talking about money because money is a disgusting thing. But Lakshmi is indeed the goddess herself. When this Lakshmi awakens within you, such a person shines. There is not a single person who people remember for generations. They are remembered by people again and again. Oh, he is the one, he is that person. Just like we are telling you about our father, when he passed away. After that, it was my brother's wedding. We saw ghee coming from somewhere, something coming from somewhere else. We couldn't understand who all these people were bringing things. We asked, 'Brother, what is this?' They started saying, 'Oh, your father, he was like a god. He saved our child. He did this for us.' They have been living in the world day and night. Similarly, you can also be like that if your navel is awakened. If a chakra wakes up somewhere, you will gain this confidence. Above it, maybe what is below is the Swadhisthana chakra. Shri Brahmadev's place is in this chakra. And you create from this. You think. You think ahead. This chakra was also very active here yesterday, and everyone's Swadhisthana chakra was caught because you all were thinking much more than necessary yesterday. Today there is a bit of cool breeze. When the Swadhisthana chakra catches, it means there is more pressure on the Swadhisthana. That's when you get the illness called diabetes. After that comes... I mean, I'm telling you about each chakra little by little. Above it, there is what is called the heart chakra, which controls your cardiac plexus. In this heart chakra, there is the place of Jagdamba, who is the mother of the entire universe. Mata Durgaji, her place is there. And Mata Durga is sitting there. When the place of your protection damages , when you don't feel safe, when you feel anxious, when you forget that your mother is Jagdamba, at that time this chakra starts malfunctioning. And due to the less movement of this chakra, respiratory diseases, or heart diseases, occur less in a person, or due to the obstruction of movement in this chakra, they occur. Above it is the chakra we call the Vishuddhi chakra. There is a place for Shri Ram on the right side of this chakra. Because Shri Ram did not consider himself an avatar, his place is on the side. Now you know. Vishnuji took ten avatars. And when he took one avatar as Ram, he reached that place within us. All the avatars are our leaders. And these leaders come within us and show us the way. And this middle path, which we call the Sushumna Nadi, is the path of Mahalakshmi, through which our evolution happens, and the ten avatars of Vishnu, they are indeed our evolutionary process. If my book gets published, you will see that I have provided a detailed analysis. But the most complete avatar is considered to be the eighth avatar, whom we know by the name of Shri Krishna. We call him complete because he is the witness of the entire universe, and he sees the divine play of the entire universe. His place is found at the back of the throat. Now, yesterday many... people were sad, in pain. Now, this is our very important chakra because it is because of this chakra that we are humans. Our neck was previously bent, but when it stood upright, this chakra started functioning. Then we can say that our Vishuddhi chakra has awakened. This happened in Krishna's era, around six thousand years ago. Six thousand years ago, the idea emerged in humans that "I am a human, completely." And when Krishna's consciousness spread, the spread of diplomacy came for the first time. Krishna is the incarnation of diplomacy. He is the incarnation of divine diplomacy. He knows all the most subtle paths of politics. People give great narratives on the Gita. I feel amused. Yesterday I told you, they don't know how many elements are there in it. Let me tell you the essence of the Gita in a few words, and you see it. In the Gita, Krishna only talked about Sahajyoga. He said, "Search for it within yourself," this is what Krishna said to Arjuna. But Arjuna was there, you can consider him as a person of mediocre intellect, and he said, "Bhai, you're saying to search for the Supreme Being and on the other hand, you're asking to go to war." He said, "First, be a witness. And then go to war. So, you will see in the war as a witness, that no one will die, and no one will live." But Arjuna didn't understand it. So, this is his father's example, they call it. I call it the father's way, that a boy is sitting outside, and hitting the cart  with a whip loudly, and the horse is behind. The father comes out and says, "Son, move the horse forward, then your cart  will move." So, the boy says, "How? I'll hit the cart ." The father says, "Okay, keep hitting, keep hitting. But keep focus on the horse." Similarly, Krishna put 2-3 absurd conditions and made everyone foolish. But since I'm a mother, I'll tell you the real thing. I won't tell you the real truth, but I'll lead the horse forward. Because Krishna knows his sons, and for the past six thousand years, he has set you all right. First, he caught you in karma yoga. He said, "Keep doing whatever work you have to do, but leave it to God. This is an absurd condition; it cannot happen. This is an absurd condition. Saying that whatever you want to do, keep doing it, cannot happen. Because you will see ahead that in your mind, there are two institutions called ego and super ego, which have made us egg-shaped. We are not broken. And because of this reason, whatever work we do, our ego gets involved in it. And when we do any work, our ego increases. With every action, our ego gets reinforced. It is within us. Our ego grows, and it is there. By ego, I don't mean pride but the arrogance that sits inside us and makes us work. It is within us, but when it breaks. When vibrations flow from within us, people say it's happening, coming, going, waking up, occurring. No one says, no one at all says that we are doing it. I am giving. I am doing. No one says such things. When a person breaks down, only then can he rise above such inaction, which Krishna called, an absurd condition. That is, the horse kept lagging behind and kept hitting in front. So later, after six thousand years, he will know who is wrong. Now many people say, "We have left all our actions to the Supreme Being. Lie! It cannot happen. Until you let go, it won't happen. When everyone accepts that it's not possible, only then can you break. After breaking, when you say it's happening, going, doing, becoming, everything that happens on its own becomes apparent. Only when this happens can it happen. ook at devotion too, let me tell you a small thing. They said about devotion that whatever you give - flowers, fruits, water - we'll take it. That's fine, take it, but what will you do when you give it! While giving, Krishna says, "Perform unwavering devotion, unwavering." Now, see, those who know Sanskrit will understand the word "ananya." No one else will. It means when you transcend, when you become a drop and merge into the ocean, then perform devotion. Unwavering devotion! Now see how absurd conditions they added. We didn't understand its formula. It doesn't happen just by giving big lectures. This is because Krishna knew that without diplomacy, these human minds, which were sitting upside down, who knows when they'll sit straight again. But I'm a mother. I'll tell you, son, this is a lie. Without transcending, nothing will happen. First, transcend. I'm also ready to work hard with you. Until you get realised, I won't stay away from you. But you must get realised. Because I'm a mother. Krishna's place is on our Vishuddhi Chakra. And from the Vishuddhi Chakra, both ego and super-ego originate. And in between here, it should be said that this is the Agnya chakra. The place of Maha Vishnu is described beautifully in our Devi Bhagavatam. The incarnation of Maha Vishnu has happened in this world, known as Jesus Christ. And its biggest main element is forgiveness. Jesus Christ is not a human. What Krishna says on him, the word Krishna comes from 'Krish', meaning agriculturalist. Rama walked through this entire world. He sanctified the lands. Krishna came here and did agriculture. He sowed the seeds here. He sowed the seed of Sahaja yoga in his Gokul. And the name of Krishna, given as Christ by Marry, who was his mother, she herself was Radha Ji. You can read about this in the Devi Mahatmya, written by Markandeya Swami. Someone as profound and perceptive as Markandeya is hard to come by. Another son like him is difficult to find. In comparison, we have our Shankaracharya. They both were also remarkable. But they are so absorbed there, in the description of the mother, that's extraordinary too. I'm amazed that on every little thing- , ’Han! Hunm! Hrim!’  they have described it in such a way that I myself am astonished as to how they knew all this. These two great individuals, Markandeya Swami and Shri Shankaracharya, are a very big deal. And they are also incarnations. Who came later with the names Hasan and Hussain. And who remained with the names Buddha and Mahavir. The same, there is only one incarnation in these three things. I am explaining this integration to you today and telling you. Because today you are sitting in the hall and listening to me. In the time of Jesus Christ, within three years, intellectuals like you hanged him. Today, no one will hang me. I know that much. Although many people trouble me. It doesn't matter. Now, even if they hang me, I see who will hang me now? Jesus Christ asked a question to his mother from his cross, "Mother, where is your son? And turning to God, he asked, 'Where is my mother?' This is a very meaningful sentence of his. Many times, when you people get hold of the Agnya chakra, I have to ask this question to Christ. It's a very subtle thing. It's a very subtle awareness. At that time, they played a game. They enacted a drama, and in that, they decided Krishna's words and explained, "Weapons cannot pierce the soul, nor can fire burn it." So long His resurrection had not taken place, his disciples made His life as hell. Twenty-five sick people were brought in and He was forced to fix this, fix that, no one listened to Him. But when they saw his resurrection, how the body rose up and moved away. Because His body is made up of divine elements itself and He  an incarnation of Lord Ganesha. They were not the son of anyone's father, Jesus Christ. Which we claim to have become big Christians ourselves. And no one's father is Lord Ganesha either. Until you are not of Lord Ganesha, you have no connection with your Lord Ganesha. And if you belong to Lord Ganesha, then Lord Krishna is also with you. And everyone is with you because "Those who against me are with me." All are standing with you in the same organization, all seven organizations are standing with you. In addition to these two chakras, Hanumanji and Bhairavnathji stand on two nerves and they also help you. Above that, you see that I have told you about the incarnation of Lord Vishnu, Jesus Christ, on the Agnya chakra today. He was made in a special way. And that He, is always called as  the father. This is about Krishna, we say father for Krishna. His name Jesus also comes from Yashoda. So, then Radha Ji thought that nothing has been said about Yashoda Ji anywhere, so she named him Jesus, Yashoda, Yesu, Jesu, like we people call Yashoda as Jesus. In some countries, Jugoslavia is called Yugoslavia. In this way, there is Jesus and Jesu. In this way, they named him Jesus. But in Gokul, Yashoda is called Jasoda. So, his name is Jesus, Jesus. Jesus is our own Krishna's only son whom Radha Ji gave birth to in Vaikuntha. In a special form, and in a special way, and Krishna had given him a great boon that whatever will be offered to me, see its sixteenth part, I make you a  for you. And you will be placed above me and the whole world will marvel at you. And these people who have come out to make Christians, their forefathers and ancestors can never understand who Jesus is? They are not even ready to read, not even ready to see how much work has been done on Jesus in our scriptures, in our religious books, and in our great people, and even today they are revered by us. You will be surprised to know that nowadays in London, there is an attempt to make such a dirty movie on  Jesus Christ that it shows a bad relationship between him and his mother. No Indian can tolerate such a thing in their country. Whether they are Christian or not. It can be tolerated there. Americans can see it, English can see it, Germans can see it, but not a single Indian will go to such a picture and the whole country will stand against it. Although we are not Christians. This is the sentiment of purity of our country. And we are bound by these small things. My disciples have come from London now, they say that you people go on such small things. How much protocol is there in your place. How someone is considered a sister here. There were some neighbours here, so I said that they are the elder brothers of my son-in-law. They said, 'Are they elder brothers? Didn't you say that he is the only son?' I said, 'It it said like that here?' They don't understand how our younger siblings, sisters, have made our society. How our society is built on beauty. Break it, finish it, there is nothing to learn from them. I'm telling you, there is nothing to learn from them.

They have accumulated some money, but they have completely put themselves at the door of hell. Learn something from them. Save your culture, it's very important. I'm telling you, this is a culture that saves the whole world. And behind this, there is the penance of many years and the holiness of many years of great people. And don't destroy it with such foolishness. If you don't want to read about it, then don't. But try to understand it. Above this, there is the highest Sahasrara, which is pierced. In this, there is the incarnation of Kalki, who brings collective consciousness. It brings all completeness. And whatever map of the entire world is there, it is bound in one thread. It is the incarnation of Kalki above. The highest place I told you is of Sadashiva. When this chakra opens, then because of the opening of Sadashiva's chakra, from there a small vein descends, which descends on the heart, and the pervasive subtle power passes through it and enters here. If I have to explain it to you, then understand it like this, if you are sitting here, then there are all kinds of pictures here and all kinds of songs are playing, but you cannot hear them. If you put a radio here, then you can listen to the song. Install a television, then you can see it. But you won't find everything spread in subtlety. Only when you have the power to grasp that subtlety, then you can catch it. Now all you have to do is to attain this thing. There will be nothing gained by criticizing it and increasing your intelligence. There have been many such great intellectuals and extremely cunning ones in the world. You don't have to be one of them. Just today I told a gentleman, "There is a gentleman in Kolhapur. He's following me. My life is in danger. What should I do?" He said, "Mother, this is the case with every saint there. Behind every saint, there are at least a thousand such evil ones born. And there are fraudulent people born and there are thousands of people behind them. His life is in danger." I said, "For me, they seem like mosquitoes for today. Their importance is no more than that. But you people should keep some wisdom. Because for me, there is nothing else. For me, it's just that my children, who have been searching for many years, thousands of years, in the dungeons, are sitting here today. They should attain it. My husband sometimes says, 'What are you doing all this for? Why do you work so hard?' So I say, 'I am serving the saints.'So they say, "I don't see any saints." So I said, "This is modern times; everyone comes dressed in suits and boots. But there are saints. If there were no saints, then why do they come to my door? These are the saints, and that's why I consider myself very fortunate that there are so many saints. And truth be told, I am very content with myself that I have never done so much work in any incarnation and never have so many people been saved by my hands. Not even one Christian of Christ was saved. And despite trying in every way, very few people were saved. Today is such a beautiful time when so many people are being saved. Just relax and sit back in it. It just requires a little discussion. You know that even for music, a discussion is needed. Then for listening to the music of God, a little discussion is needed. You will feel the joy, you will feel the happiness. Yesterday there was a lot of chaos. I couldn't save anyone properly. So many people have come. It's a new kind of experience. I was hoping that you all would hold my hand and sit, maybe if someone is sitting, they have found it. Take off your shoes. Sit for a little while. And then if it's done, I'll come myself. I see everyone here. You stay in your place. I am ready to give time. You also sit for a while. I want to bless everyone who is sitting here completely. If you don't get through today, then come back tomorrow here. Tomorrow there is music here. Shobha Gurtoo and some artists have been invited in the evening. Everyone must come here. You all must come here tomorrow for sure. And listen to the music here. And during the music, I will also try to help you get realisation through music. Because Shobha Gurtoo has also transcended. And all the other musicians have also crossed. Many people have transcended in this way. Many prominent people have taken realisation here. Our honourable Justice Vaidya is also a very high-level collaborator. And he got realisation in a moment. His experiences are amazing. Maybe he is also coming tomorrow. He will also talk about this matter. They are very virtuous. They are very learned and very humble. They are also coming tomorrow. Many such friends of the Kolkata High Court; the Chief Justice has also transcended. And many doctors too are there who got realised. And if you have heard the name of Dr. Nagendrasingh, then he too has transcended. Many people have experienced this. But these people are very calm and humble. And they hesitate to talk about themselves because they think if they have realisation, people will think they are speaking with great arrogance. As many people transcend, I see that they become very humble. And due to humility, people do not talk about themselves. But you must have seen that he is a small boy. He is not particularly educated. He is just twelve years old and he can still tell you about your chakras, where your Kundalini is. For this, it is not necessary to be renowned. It is not necessary to be wealthy. It is not necessary to be poor. Whoever has the right will become. Today as well as tomorrow. And my invitation to all of you is to come prepared. And those are realized in Sahaja Yoga, and those who have become Sahaja Yogis, I request those people to please give your names here. In addition, every Tuesday evening at Bharati Vidya Bhavan, our collaborators give lectures there. And they play tapes of my lectures. Besides, if you have any questions, if you want someone to help you transcend, if there is anything, you can go. And these people are capable themselves. Together, they will help you by all means. If anyone is sick, they can also go. And all the work is free. You don't have to pay for this because this is your mother's love. And there is no question of money in this. Thank you very much!
