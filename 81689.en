जय श्रीमात्र जी।

लेकिन कुछ चीजें जो हिंदी में हम लोग व्यक्त कर सकते हैं, वह उसके लिए इंग्लिश में शब्द परिपूर्ण नहीं हैं। इसलिए please use both languages and to describe your phenomenal, absolutely unbelievable times.

Dr. Rekha Nigam:
अगर आपको श्री माताजी के लिए... अपने पहले जानना चाहते हैं, तो वो अपने पूरा प्रभाव था और उसके लिए उन्होंने एक विशेष पेंडेंट बना था। पापा और मम्मी को फ़ोन करके उन्होंने कहा कि तुम लोग आओ। Papa had already had a paralysis and I was attending on to him, so I also accompanied him. So, I had that pendant and when he fell ill, that was because before that, I was not a very spiritual person. We don't have a very spiritual background from my parents' side, although my grandmother and my great-grandmother—my father's grandmother—they had a mandir in the house and every day there was a pooja going on. आज एकादशी है, आज फलाना है, आज प्रसाद बनता है। So my interest was, being the youngest in the family, my interest was there कि वहाँ जाके शाम को आरती के टाइम पे घंटा बजाओ और प्रसाद लेके आ जाओ। That was it.

Otherwise, my father was just not interested because there was a background with his दादी। वो वहाँ चार बजे नहाती थीं, गीली धोती पहन के पूजा के कमरे में बैठ जाती थीं और उनकी जो maid थी, वो बाहर बैठी थी। उनको ‘बीवी’ बोलता है, “बीवी, आज फलाने की दुल्हन भाग गई।” वो बोलती, “जो ऐसे दैया रे दैया,” और फिर राम-राम-राम करने लगती है। वो पूजा करती भी और, between the pooja, back to that gossip। वो माला फेरती है, वो पीछे से... It was not a real pooja; it was just a ढकोसला। My father, he never believed in pooja. He never did pooja, even on Janmashtami or anything.

उन्होंने कहा तो मैं पहन लेती हूँ, बाकी आप संभाल लेना, मुझे नहीं मालूम what is right and what is wrong. And honestly, before having any experience, how would you know who is right and who is wrong? And especially after such a big trauma in my life, I was really scared. So ultimately, the second day also, I could not throw it, because I had to go and throw it in the Yamuna, and that was very far off from my house. So the second day again, we went for the program, and she looked at me. She said, “फेंक दिया?” I said, “अभी नहीं फेंका, कल फेंक दूँगी।” I was still scared, because I was thinking, should I tell her the truth or not? बोलूँ कि नहीं फेंका? But it was an immense confusion.

Anyway, पर उस दिन क्या हुआ कि हम लौट के आए, and we had a very smart photographer. और उसको एक coffee table का फूलदान साइड पर रख के against the wall, एक candle जला दी। And we were foot soaking. एक तरफ से दरवाजा था, door, उसका bedroom का, और दूसरी तरफ था बच्चों का दरवाजा। And both of us, Sushmita, that was my only experience as a Sahaja Yogi, which I pray to have it once a day. We were drenched in vibrations. Drenched! मतलब हम जैसे कर रहे थे, and we were like in a pool. I was looking at the door, इधर से हवा नहीं, इधर से हवा नहीं, कहाँ से हवा आ रही है? And then, trying to be very intelligent, I looked at the candle. मैंने कहा, यह तो flicker नहीं कर रहा है। तो हवा नहीं चल रही है, तो candle क्यों नहीं हिल रही है? All the time, with those beautiful vibrations, I kept on analyzing from where this breeze was coming. But I felt very nice, very nice.

तो दूसरे दिन सच बोलने की हिम्मत बढ़ गई। मैंने कहा, “अभी नहीं फेंका, फिर फेंक आएँगे।” And she said nothing. She said nothing after that. Second day में जाके, वहाँ पर यमुना जी में गए, भगवान से pray किया, “भगवान जो सही हो, वो करवा दीजिएगा, हमें नहीं मालूम।” उसके बाद सुष्मिता, उन्होंने हमसे पूछा नहीं। She just asked me, “तुमने रखा कि फेंका? क्या किया?”

That was my first experience.

Interviewer:
So where was this program? Is this in Noida, or where was this?

Dr. Rekha Nigam:
This was in Delhi, Kalkaji. This was our first program, Kalkaji, in 1981. It was in a hall, and we were sitting in the first row. और बच्चों को घर पे छोड़के आए थे because I had to, you know, sort of be a supporter, look after. But that was my first experience. उसके बाद तो हमने एक भी प्रोग्राम नहीं छोड़ा।

And since you were talking to Dr. Nigam regarding our experience as a couple with Shri Mataji, which is very important, I must tell you one thing more. In '83, there were some weddings that happened in Delhi, और श्री माताजी ने कहा, “कि आप लोग फिर से शादी कर लीजिए।” So in '83 we got married in Sahaja Yoga. Amazing! And my son was sitting on the ghodi with Dr. Nigam, and my daughter—in '83 she was like 5 years old, 5 and a half years old—she was very enamored by my dressing, क्योंकि वो सारा bridal makeup and सारा कुछ, साड़ी, jewelry पहनाई हुई थी। So she was just fiddling with my jewelry. I was sitting there as a bride. Guido also got married the same year, in the same group.

Interviewer:
अरे वाह! Oh nice!

Dr. Rekha Nigam:
We got married together. And then we had a very small house in that apartment, a two-bedroom house, and we were 22 people living in that house. We gave one bedroom to Guido as a newly married couple, and we had one bedroom as a joint dining room. We used to put the dining table on top of the dining table, और उसके नीचे भी घुस के बिस्तर लगा के सारे जमीन पर बिस्तर लगा के, 22 people. And since morning to the evening, we were busy with Shri Mataji, attending the program in the evening. रात में खिचड़ी बनती थी, और सब लोग खाके सो जाते थे। अरे वाह! That was it. तो 22 लोग सारे सहज योगी थे?

I can tell you, they were all... Rustom was number one, then Guido, Dr. Spiro, all these persons. Mathias wasn't there. All these beginners, they were all there. In '83, Russians didn't come. All of them stayed with us. And do you know why Shri Mataji asked us to marry? The reason was this: there were 13 marriages fixed by the collective. So she said, “13 is not a good number, एक और शादी कर दो।” तो हम लोग बैठे बोले, “इनकी शादी कर दो!” That is how we got married.

Interviewer:
Well, congratulations, so many years later! That's amazing.

Dr. Rekha Nigam:
Thank you. Thank you very much. Wow.

Interviewer:
So ये number 13, जो आप बता रहे थे, Shri Mataji ने इस विषय में क्या कहा? Because the jury is out on this, that 13 is not auspicious.

Dr. Nigam:
So, it was just a passing comment. She did not emphasize on it कि होना ही चाहिए, नहीं होना चाहिए। So just a passing comment, “ये सब तेरह हो रहे हैं, एक और कर दो।”

Interviewer:
Fantastic, fantastic story.

Dr. Rekha Nigam:
It was just like a mela, from morning till the evening. लक्ष्मी, cooking, hosting everyone. It’s not an easy task! And just... we used to put one big patila on the fire and make food for everyone. सब्जी वाली खिचड़ी, पुलाव, को जो लखनऊ में पापा मम्मी हम लोग जब खाते थे, तो दो चीजें होती थीं, जब थक जाते थे और कुछ नहीं बनाना है तो खिचड़ी बनती थी या फिर तहरी उसको बोलते थे जिसमें सब्जी डालते हैं।

Interviewer:
Aunty Nigam, while you were busy hosting and just enjoying the festivities with everyone, with Shri Mataji doing all this... I can absolutely feel the palpable joy and the festive feeling that you would have had at that time. You can feel it now as we talk. What was your experience then, Uncle?

Dr. Nigam:
I told you in my last lecture, there's so many, so many more I can tell you.

Interviewer:
Do share the ones that you haven't.

Dr. Nigam:
I wanted to share with you some deep things. At that time, even I didn't know what was happening, but these were the deep things. When she told us about certain things, we could not understand at that time. Yes. But today, after say 30-40 years, I am now understanding. The latest one is this, which I feel and you must have also noticed: those yogis who are opening a new center or they are running a center, in their lecture, they will say, "Mother said so." In this lecture, Shri Mataji said, "You don't wear this thing, don't do this thing." Shri Mataji said, "Don't eat this thing or get up at four o'clock in the morning." Shri Mataji said... Everybody is talking now.

In the beginning, I also used to say that Mother said so, you should get up and do meditation and all these things. But in later years, and that is very important, she, in many of her lectures, she said, "Don't say that Mother said so." If you remember, she said in many lectures, "Don't say that Mother has said so. You say what you have to say." This point I could not understand at that time. Reasonably, we all used to say, "Mother said so, Mother said so." Now I realized why she told us this. She said, "Say what you have to say." First, experience all these things. Experience them, and then you tell the people, "This will happen, this will happen this way." You must be capable of telling and informing them what will happen when we will do this thing. This is the most important point for those persons now. They must say it is like this. What she wanted was that you should become capable of telling people what you experienced.

A very important point is this: all those people, there are so many gurus in the market, you know this thing. Three or four gurus are up to a certain level. They can't give realization, but they talk. Now they have started talking of vibrations also. I followed each and every one. You name any guru of today, I have been following them right from 1955 till date. I can name them. In the beginning, they didn't talk. They started with one... do you know what was the first sentence a guru said? "I am the one." This was the first reaction I had, and it was said by a guru, very popular. You must be knowing it. I can name him. He said this thing in '85. Then there are others, I don't want to name them. They have mugged it.

But the point is this: there is a big difference between gyan and knowledge.

Interviewer:
Yes. Can you please elaborate on that, Uncle? Because it's very hard to translate gyan. Normally it is translated as knowledge, but please elaborate.

Dr. Nigam:
There is no English word for gyan anywhere in the world. Today, I claim that there is no word for gyan. I tried to know it from everybody. I tried to use almost half of the word. They all say "knowledge," which is not adequate. Knowledge anybody can get by reading books, by doing this thing, that thing. But gyan is that which you experience on your central nervous system. That is gyan. So all these gurus, they have knowledge but not gyan. First experience the gyan and then distribute it. Then people will accept you. So we should emphasize on gyan only, not on knowledge. All these persons, they were not literate, but they had the real knowledge, gyan. They had the gyan. So what Shri Mataji wanted from us is that we should attain that gyan. That will save you from ego also, and when you will speak, it will have a different effect than when they will speak. Now when we listen to these persons, we know.

Interviewer:
Tell us about the times when Shri Mataji... I mean, those times were so precious and unparalleled, where you would just sit with her and you'd be talking. This gyan would be just a normal conversation, isn't it? So tell us some of the techniques that helped to grow deeper and to experience that firsthand on the central nervous system.

Dr. Nigam:
I think in '87, '88, when I read this thing... up till this point, I was so lucky. I was the only person who never needed Shri Mataji's permission. I was because I was attending on to her. I would go, come out, go and come out. So, when I read this sentence, then I thought, "No, she is the one." Wow. These are the particular experiences. Many a time, we were under our maya. We just behaved like normal human beings, and she would also behave like that.

Interviewer:
The important question, and Shri Mataji, I think it was a press conference or something where she said, "If Lord Jesus Christ walked into this hall, how would you know?" So how do you know Shri Mataji is the Adi Shakti? I know we know it from vibrations, but this video might be watched by people who don't know much about Sahaja Yoga, who don't know much about vibrations.

Dr. Nigam:
I am being very honest with you that being a doctor and an egoistic person, I really wanted to know the truth. I was not against anybody; I wanted to know the truth. Up till that time, we never heard the name of Adi Shakti.

Then what happened... I think it was '88. I went to Shri Mataji's room. "Shri Mataji, these foreigners are coming. Some gift for them?" I said it suddenly. She said, "Now I won't say anything. Now you all have grown up, you decide yourself." Now I am standing at the door. "Shri Mataji, tell me something." "I won't tell you anything. You all do something yourself." I am standing because we couldn't do anything else. We are standing hand in hand.

Then those days, Shri Mataji used to talk a lot about the book Amritanubhav. "This is a nice book, everybody should read it." So, it came out of my mouth, "I will give all of them Amritanubhav." As soon as I told her I would give all of them Amritanubhav, she was writing something. She looked at me and said something... sarcastic. I don't know the word. She smiled at me with such a sarcastic look. This thing is sitting in my mind. We think and meditate that the face of Mother who smiled at me with such a sarcastic look, why did she smile like this? "Again, I am speaking for the benefit of others. In trying to get hold of the entire light, you end up getting the flame. Same way, worshipping the true nature of Devi, you end up getting Shiva." So we reach Shiva through Shri Mataji. So who can be the power of Shiva? That is Adi Shakti. That is why she is Adi Shakti.

आपको आपने चैतन्य आने लगता है, जोकि वायब्रेशन है, जोकि शिव है। ठीक है ना? जिस दिन मेरे को यह हुआ, तो मैं बहुत, बहुत एकदम से बिल्कुल जैसे बोलते हैं कि आँखें खुल गईं, दिल खुल गया, दिमाग खुल गया। मैंने कहा, यह तो बहुत सही बात है। हम लोग... Two, three days after that, I was meditating and I was praying to Shri Mataji. Automatically, my Kundalini rose so much, I became myself full of vibrations. There was no body, nothing like this, no brain, nothing. Then I realized, then I believed that Shri Mataji is Adi Shakti. This was the day when I completely believed and surrendered to her.

Interviewer:
This experience, you are speaking, is this 1999-2000 when you had this?

Dr. Nigam:
This experience, I think yes, '93-'94. And once more, in '88 or '89, in Ganpatipule, हम लोग समुद्र में नहा रहे थे। 8-10 लोग थे। नहा के गीले कपड़े पहने ही निकले, श्री माताजी का कमरा था नंबर वन, उनका सुइट था। नंबर वन के सामने से जैसे ही निकले... you will not believe, ऐसा कुछ चला कि जैसे एक रौशनी सी चली, light...

"Until you will recognize me, you will not get Sahaja Yoga."

एक दिन शिवाजी महाराज की कुंडलनी बहुत कसके चढ़ गई ऊपर, he became just vibrations. तो उन्होंने कहा, “अरे, इससे बढ़िया तो कोई स्थिति नहीं है।” तो भागे-भागे गए समर्थ रामदास के पास कि महाराज... उनके पैर छुए। तो बोले, “महाराज, आप हमें कोई अपनी निशानी दे दीजिए जिसको कि हम यूज़ कर सकें।” तो उनका एक पुराना लंगोट टाइप का टंगा हुआ था। बोले, “तुम इसको ले जाओ।” जाओ, यह आपको कभी पावर की इच्छा नहीं होगी। अगर इच्छा होती है, तो अभी आपके अंदर कमी है।

The two things she said are: "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes." आपका माइंड जो है, वो adulterous चीजों पर ना जाए। It takes time, लेकिन इसमें आपको Right Side भी यूज़ करनी पड़ेगी। कि आप जैसे मान लीजिए आप देर से सो गए, कहीं दिमाग जा रहा है, तो आपको इसको negate करना पड़ेगा।

"Shri Mataji, please help me get rid of this." Then it works. This is what I have experienced. जितने झगड़े-अगड़े चल रहे हैं आजकल, यह तो सब देखकर हँसी आती जब श्री माताजी कहती हैं ना, कि "यह सब मैंने किसी को लीडर बना दिया है..."

Let me tell you a story about a leader. हम लोग इसी गेस्ट हाउस में टिके हुए थे। तो मैं तो क्योंकि श्री माताजी के साथ था, तो लोग... तब तक जो है, दिल्ली में पाँच-सात लोग हो गए, काफी ठीक हो गया। तो बैठे थे, तो उन्होंने बुलाया, “इसको बुलाओ।” I called him. तो उन्होंने एक particular आदमी का नाम लिया। He’s a very nice Sahaja Yogi, even today he is a great Sahaja Yogi. He was the leader and very nice. He came. “हाँ, आया है।” “अच्छा, आप जाइए, दोनों को कह दीजिए that you have been made world leaders.” उन दिनों पहले था कि अपना दिल्ली का लीडर, फिर इंडिया का लीडर, फिर वर्ल्ड लीडर। So, they were made the next world leaders.

अब मेरी हालत यह खराब। He said, "Thank you, Shri Mataji. Give me the power so I can serve the world."

इसमें कुछ आपको गलत लगती है बात? मैं इतना परेशान रहा। मैंने कुछ नहीं कहा, क्योंकि यह बात ऐसी थी कि सबको मालूम पड़ गई। तो एक-दो लोग थे जो श्री माताजी के साथ रहते थे, एक-दो लोग जो पुराने थे, उन्होंने बात करी। तो Mother ने कहा, "Why did he say, 'Give me the strength so that I could do this thing?' Does he do anything? I do everything. That is why he has been removed." Understand? This was the point. You do nothing. When you come to this state, then you deserve to become a world leader. Wow.

Interviewer:
So roughly this is about two thousand something, isn't it? Because उसके पहले world leader नहीं होते थे, is that right uncle?

Dr. Nigam:
नहीं, होते थे, वर्ल्ड लीडर होते थे इससे पहले। आप देखते हैं, इतने-इतने बड़े प्रोग्राम होते हैं, आराम से सब निपट जाते हैं।

This is probably a story from '81. मेरे को सहज योग में आए 15-20 दिन हुए होंगे, महीना भर हुआ होगा। We used to get a black and white photo for one rupee. तो Mother asked me, “आप लोग ये फोटो कैसे देते हैं?” हमने कहा, “श्री माताजी, एक रुपया लेते हैं, एक रुपया दे जाते हैं।” She said, “No, आप लोग फोटो का एक रुपया नहीं लेंगे। आप लोग अपने पैसे से फोटो बनवाएँगे और फ्री में देंगे। पैसा तो आपके पास चलकर खुद आएगा, कि आप ईमानदारी से सहज योग का काम कीजिए।” मैं इतने साल लीडर रहा, मेरे को एक पैसे की कभी कमी नहीं हुई।

So, it is the thing of being fully dependent on Shri Mataji and also doing everything to please Shri Mataji. That's simple, but in the modern world, easier said than done, isn't it?

In '88, after the Guru Puja in Italy, the Guru Puja materials used to go from India. गुरु पूजा खत्म हो गई। एक दिन और रुके थे। Third day, I and Yogi Mahajan went to Shri Mataji. “श्री माताजी, इजाजत दीजिए, हम लोग अब वापस जाना चाहते हैं।”

श्री माताजी बोलीं, “मैं भी चल रही हूँ। तो आप लोग मेरे साथ चलिए, मेरे को भी दिल्ली जाना है।” So we traveled together. She said, “बस एक छोटा सा काम है, हमको एक साइन करने हैं रोम एयरपोर्ट पर।” वहाँ पर ऐसी फ्लाइट लेंगे। There is a rule that if people traveling in first class have a break of more than six hours anywhere, they get a room at the airport. So at the Rome airport, Sir CP and Shri Mataji got two rooms. Mother said, “एक में आप और योगी रुक जाइए, मैं एक रूम में रुकती हूँ।”

Mother went inside. You will not believe, we were still talking, we hadn't even entered the room, and Shri Mataji came out of her room, absolutely fresh, as if she had just bathed and gotten ready. Within five minutes.

She said, “I have to go shopping.” तो वो Sir CP के साथ शॉपिंग करने चले गए। “मैं शाम को मिलूँगी।” हमारी 7:20 की फ्लाइट थी। तो भाई, मैंने योगी से कहा, "योगी, चलो पास में ही एयरपोर्ट के अंदर ही था होटल हमारा।" तो वहाँ से चार-पाँच सौ गज की दूरी पर था। So we went. "चलो वहीं चलते हैं, शायद श्री माताजी आ गई हों।"

We got worried. 7:20 की फ्लाइट, सवा सात बज गया, साढ़े सात बज गया, और श्री माताजी नहीं आईं। And the announcement is going on, "Mr. Srivastava, Mrs. Srivastava, Yogi Mahajan, Dr. Nigam, please board the plane. It's getting delayed because of you." उन्होंने एक ट्रॉली भेज दी अपनी बैटरी वाली।

Around 7:45, she came, smiling and laughing. और जैसे ही हम दोनों को देखा, डाँटने लगीं, “आप लोगों से मैंने कहा था कि मैं आऊँगी, तो आप लोग वहाँ रुके क्यों नहीं?” “Sorry, Shri Mataji, जब साढ़े सात बज गया...” “कुछ भी होता, जब मैंने कहा था तो आपको वहाँ रुकना चाहिए।”

And you believe, जो एक pillow होता है ना, इतने बड़े-बड़े बैग, सोलह बैग, वो उसको लेकर श्री माताजी ट्रॉली में बैठ गईं। And the whole airport was watching us, wondering how we would travel with so much hand baggage. As we reached the plane, everyone started hooting because the plane was delayed because of us.

We were in economy class, Mother was in first class. वो बैठ गए, हम लोग बैठ गए। The plane was supposed to leave at 7:20, and we all boarded around 8:30. Now the plane won't start. Then at 9:15, the pilot announced, "Because of technical reasons, we are not able to start."

Interviewer:
It reminds me of a talk we were watching where Shri Mataji was talking about this. She was travelling with some Sahaja Yogis from Austria and Italy to Poland. Wolfgang Hackl... same story.

Dr. Nigam:
That story everybody knows. You have to bring your attention inside. जैसे ही attention बाहर जाएगी, you are not a Sahaja Yogi. You cannot survive there. जिसके ऊपर attention श्री माताजी की कई बार जाती थी, तो जैसे कोई बहुत भिखारी हो, गरीब हो, चोट लगी हो, तो कहती थीं, “उस पर मत देखो, मैं उसका दुःख पकड़ लेती हूँ।” तो उस चीज़ से बचना था।

Tukaram was once asked, “महाराज, हम याद तो भगवान को बहुत करते हैं, लेकिन बीच में भूल जाते हैं।” तो तुकाराम ने एक जवाब दिया, “तुम हमको एक चीज यह बताओ, अगर तुम्हारे पास कोई हीरा हो, जिसकी कीमत 10 करोड़ हो, तो तुम उसको क्या करते हो?” बोले, “उसको संभाल के रखते हैं, सीने से लगा कर रखते हैं, उसको छोड़ते नहीं।” “रात को भी लगा कर रखते हैं?” “बिल्कुल।” “उसको छोड़ते तो नहीं कभी?” “नहीं छोड़ते।”

Point यह है कि detachment and forgiveness, these are the two mantras for being a good Sahaja Yogi. This is what I have learnt from him. I may be wrong, I don't claim.

She told everyone, in front of me. Even Guido, he was considered a very great Sahaja Yogi, you know that. He was a very dear friend of mine. उसको उन्होंने एक-दो बार मेरे सामने कहा, “Guido, you have to recognize me.” Guido सिर झुका के, आँख में आँसू लेके निकल जाए। Because he was very... I mean, Shri Mataji loved him too much, no doubt. In the beginning, Mother always told everybody, "You will have to recognize me, then you will be happy." So you have to recognize her by meditating, and once, for two minutes, if you drown yourself into her, you will know the truth. उसके बाद फिर आपको doubt नहीं होगा। That is doubtless awareness.

Interviewer:
So, what I want to just inform my dear friends, younger brothers, sisters: आजकल जो कुछ चल रहा है, गड़बड़ी है, यह सब temporary है। इसमें आप पड़िए ही नहीं, ध्यान करते रहिए, और अपने आपको strong कीजिए। जो और जितनी चीजें हैं, यह धीरे-धीरे करके सब निकल जाएँगी। Only the truth will survive.

Dr. Nigam, now let's get back to auntie. It's very nice that both of you have joined. दिल्ली में सर्दी हो गई है, इस समय, as we go closer to Holi, but सर्दी-जुकाम के बावजूद आप लोग हमारे साथ हैं, इसके लिए आपका विशेष रूप से बहुत-बहुत धन्यवाद। तो श्री माताजी के साथ कुछ लम्हें हम लोग के साथ बताइए जो विशेष रूप से लखनऊ के बारे में, या कानपुर के बारे में, क्योंकि आपका एक connection था उस geographical area से। ऐसा कुछ है आपके जहन में?

Dr. Rekha Nigam:
When she was in Lucknow, she was traveling from Lucknow to Delhi by train. She was alone in a first-class compartment, and I was with her. It was a very small compartment. After dinner, I used to press her feet a little because of her illness. तो उन्होंने क्या किया, अपने पैर मेरी गोद में रख दिए और मैं वहीं पर बैठ के उनका थोड़ा सा पैर सहला रही। उसके बाद वो लेट गईं। Now that she was lying down, the berth above was empty, but how could I have the courage to sleep above Shri Mataji? तो मैं नीचे दरी बिछा कर सो गई। She laughed and said, “कहीं और जगह नहीं है, वहीं सो जाओ जाकर।”

And then, I woke up in the night and came out of the compartment to go to the washroom. When I came back, I got lost. I didn't know which compartment to enter. I got lost in the corridor. Suddenly the door opened and she said, “अच्छा हुआ तुम आ गईं, मुझे समझ नहीं आ रहा था।”

We have a small experience from Moscow. We were tired, the scenery was all there, but there was nothing to eat. We were about 7-8 people. He never called me by my name, he always used to call me 'Mrs. Nigam'. "Let's go and do some shopping." "Alright, Shri Mataji, for you, vegetables and rice together." So we went shopping. You won't believe, the size of the rice was like moong dal, the washed kind. मैंने कहा, “हाय भगवान, इससे तहरी बनानी है।” I said, “हाय भगवान, सारा मसाला नीचे हो जाएगा।” When I served it to Shri Mataji, I said, “माताजी, मुझे यहाँ के चावल का अंदाज़ नहीं मालूम है।” She said, “कोई बात नहीं है, स्वाद अच्छा है।”

When we reached Vienna, she said that the food here is very influenced by Afghanistan and India because it is a former Soviet area. There, stuffed capsicum is made with minced meat, but for me, they made it with rice. She told me I hadn't seen the Hermitage and there was very little time left. So she put the food she had in her hand into my hand and said, "There's no time, eat this as you go, and go quickly, otherwise it will close."

At 4 a.m., I woke up in the morning. I needed to make tea, but there was nothing in that room, no kettle or anything. So I opened my own market basket, took out tea leaves. No milk, no sugar, nothing. I put the tea leaves in a glass, poured in water from the geyser, and that's how I managed. Shri Mataji was very practical about everything.

Interviewer:
Just like last time when Uncle was talking about how Shri Mataji arranged food for them in France. Are there any other such incidents?

Dr. Nigam:
Have you seen the Bismillah Khan video? A talk between Shri Mataji and Bismillah Khan. Bharat Ratna is talking with Adi Shakti. Khan Sahab himself accepted, "आज जाने क्या हो गया, आपकी presence में इतना अच्छा निकल गया।" Then he recited a sher: “राग, रसोई, पागड़ी, कभी-कभी बन जाए।” राग मतलब जो भजन गाते हैं, जो शहनाई बजाते हैं। राग और रसोई, खाना, किसी-किसी दिन बहुत बढ़िया बन जाता है अपने आप, एकदम। राग, रसोई, पागड़ी, जो पगड़ी होती है, daily पहनते हैं, लेकिन किसी-किसी दिन बहुत बढ़िया बन जाती है।

Dr. Rekha Nigam:
At that time, we didn't have the realization of Shri Mataji. We used to live down the road from where Shri Mataji built that house, a beautiful house. She was sitting with me, and she pointed upwards, “उपर देखो, उपर देखो।” And that was the second time when I saw that pyramid on her head. The first time was when we were going to Patna, when she was sitting on the window side and I was on the outside. She pressed my hand, “वहाँ देखो, वहाँ देखो।” “हाँ, दिखा।” She said, “ये सारी कुंडलियाँ हैं, ये देखो।” So twice she showed me Kundalini, once in the flight and one at the doctor's wedding, where she was sitting in the courtyard.

Interviewer:
Can you describe what you saw? A pyramid of vibrations, Kundalini?

Dr. Rekha Nigam:
Wow! And they were just... like a chimney with lots of smoke, like mosquitoes in a swarm, just swirling. They were just shaking, moving around, moving around. And they were, I don't know, trillions or millions. I just cannot... And then she started talking to someone else. It got cut off, and then everything just vanished.

Interviewer:
It's like sometimes we are in a state of bliss, and then the mind comes in, "Is this really happening?" And then it disappears.

Dr. Rekha Nigam:
Yes, that's right. The moment your attention goes to something else, that beautiful thing disappears. This is the real thing.

Interviewer:
Sushmita ji, very nice to talk to you. Thank you for joining us and thank you for sharing your precious memories with Shri Mataji herself. The photo that we see in your background is the first one in London?

Dr. Rekha Nigam:
1977. No, 1980, Guru Puja. Dr. Rustom brought this photograph for me especially, and since then it is with me. I meditate on it.

Interviewer:
That is so beautiful. There are many more moments and there are many more memories, I am sure. We will talk again, and we look forward to talking to you. Thank you so much for joining us.

Dr. Nigam:
Did you see the video of when Shri Mataji came to our house?

Interviewer:
No, you haven't shown us. Could you please?

Dr. Nigam:
I will send it. Please email it, and in the next video then we can share it, that and the Ustad Bismillah Khan one.

Dr. Rekha Nigam:
And one more thing you mentioned, auntie, in a light-hearted way, about the Kayasthas. हमारे छोटे भैया हैं, कायस्थों वाली बात तो हमसे आप पूछिए। Look, this is Dr. Nigam, a Kayastha from UP. Food is his life.

Dr. Nigam:
There are no words to describe the experience of worshipping Shri Mataji with my mother, father, and my brothers, and spending time with her. It's very special, very, very special. What a miracle. I mean, these things are nothing for Shri Mataji, it's just so amazing. We are so fortunate. My younger brother used to say at home, “अगर छोटे भैया बदल गए, तो भाई कोई ज़रूर बात है।” And they started coming to our house for collective meditation, and then they started sitting for meditation.

Interviewer:
Thank you so much, Aunty and Uncle. Jai Shri Mataji.

Both:
Jai Shri Mataji.
