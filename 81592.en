What were you doing before you got your realisation? What was your first meeting with Shri Mataji like? Let's start with Daniela, please.

It was the 6th of June in 1980. I was at school, so I was about 13. I'd just come home from school to chuck my book bags down in the hall, and my mum, Magda, who was a great seeker throughout my childhood, was always telling me all about yoga. She had seen a poster of Shri Mataji, and she asked, "Would you like to come with me?" That was a period of time when I wasn't hanging out so much with my mum, being 13 or 14, but something in me said, "Yeah, I think I will."

I do remember very clearly, we went to the Friends Meeting House in Hampstead. It was the first time Shri Mataji had visited Hampstead, and we were very early. We were greeted by all these beautiful people preparing for her arrival. The atmosphere was very meditative, and there was something very special in the air. In those days, I guess, the model for Sahaja Yoga was India, followed by England. So, in retrospect, I can see it was like a puja, with the oil lamps. I could see Chaya and Maureen and Dougie just slowly preparing everything with such dignity, and it just felt like something was happening.

So my mum and I were just sitting at the front, watching and waiting. As we were waiting, the vibrations were just getting so strong. We didn't know about vibrations, obviously, but I remember someone gave a talk. I don't think I followed what he was saying because I couldn't see him. He was probably sitting as close as you are, because we were that close to the front, and the vibrations were just like torrential rain. I turned to mum and said, "Can you see that?" And she said, "Yes." We just lost the hall.

Eventually, Shri Mataji arrived. Most of the hall were probably Sahaja Yogis. Everyone spontaneously stood, and we stood. We bowed, and she sat. Apparently, she had just come from a diplomatic function. I wouldn't have known that, but she was dressed in a particularly glamorous way. She had come with a very bright sari with gold, and she had bangles and nail polish. So for a young teenage girl, just looking at her, I thought, "She's so beautiful." She stood just a few feet in front of me the whole time. Again, I didn't really follow her talk because perhaps my liver or my attention... I wasn't really listening. I was just looking at her sari, her bangles, her feet.

Then eventually, she said, "Now everyone will get it." I was thinking, "Get what? What is this thing?" I thought she was just a wonderful lady. And then, sitting there when she went through the realization, that was the moment when it was like, wow. When I was little, I was always trying to stop the thinking, stop the thoughts. I would shut the light, shut my eyes, shut the door, but I could never stop thinking. It was like a game I used to play. I remember just sitting there, and the thinking, the chatter, had stopped. I couldn't move.

She came over to both me and my mum, and she was very sweet with my mum, saying some lovely things about her being a great seeker and having a fantastic, obedient heart. We didn't really know what that meant, but it sounded lovely. And she looked at me, she sort of laughed, put her hand on my head, and looked in my eyes. Her face was really close to mine, and she said, "Your eyes now, they're black, like mine." And it was just like love, this feeling of just love. I felt I could just follow her. A Sahaja Yogi had touched her feet, and I wanted to ask if I could go to her feet, but I wasn't sure about the protocol. So we just left it the first time. But we followed her around the hall as she worked on everyone. All the people here would have experienced how active, energetic, and involved she was, how each person was worked on in the meeting. It was really clear she was moving her arms like weapons. We just followed her, completely in her spell.

We heard she was giving a public program on the Sunday, so we went to see her again, but it wasn't a public program; it was the ashram, and somehow we'd snuck in. Sure enough, when she saw us walking in, she beckoned like this, held out her feet, and said, "Come." She allowed me to go to her feet.

What was it like?

Oh, what was that like? It was like falling into infinity, a feeling of complete timelessness. The kundalini was coming up with such a force, because I had a block on my liver. The kundalini always, if there's a block, particularly the liver, you can see it. So although I was there for what felt like a long time—it could have been five minutes, ten minutes, an hour—when I got up, everyone was looking because my body was shaking with such a force to the liver. Eventually, I sat down, and as I sat down, it was just shooting up again.

We were so lucky and so blessed. That was the Sunday. On the Monday, she was at Caxton Hall. During the week, I believe she went somewhere else outside London. My mum and I went along, and she said, "You've come all this way," which was like an hour outside London. "Thank you." We used to sit very nicely and just watch, and then she'd say, "No, no, come on. You come and help me. You work on this one." So eventually we realized there was something to do and it wasn't just about following her.

As a 13-year-old, after this experience of realisation, which everyone could see, what was life like in your school, for instance? What was the change that you noticed?

It was a big change because there was a choice. There was a definite choice. There was, "You can go down this road and go out with these friends," or "You can be with Shri Mataji." I actually had a dream that she came to my house, and I went to her feet again, and she told me, "Leave those friends. They're not good for you," those particular friends. But I knew that anyway. Because she gave us so much attention and it was so magical being with her, I didn't actually miss hanging out with those friends at school. I just changed very quickly. The confidence she was giving us, seeing her every week... we were so lucky.

You also mentioned earlier how you drew a portrait of Shri Mataji in an art class without ever having met her, just a few days before.

Yes. In a free class—I did art for my O-Levels—the teacher said, "Just draw whatever you like." So I started off drawing a face. It was, first of all, an Indian man, then an Indian lady. And then I thought it was a Native American Indian. And then I put a massive bindi on it. It became very, very similar to the early black and white photograph of her. It was shaded and very peaceful. I just drew it for about two hours, and my best friend really liked it, so I gave it to her. But when I saw Shri Mataji in that photo, I said, "Oh, I think I drew this."

Is that the photo with the mudra?

The early one, yes.
