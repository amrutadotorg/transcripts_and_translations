So, we'll just take a few minutes with our attention in the Sahasrara to feel vibrations as we start this recording with Leslie and Sushmita today, Friday, February 21st. Sushmitaji, we ask that all our words spoken here today come through you. We are gathered to share our memories of the very special time we shared in your physical presence. And we hope, we want that others may experience the joy of being with you at those very special times that have happened. We're going back nearly 40 years, which is a long time. We'll just keep attention in the Sahasrara for a minute.

Thank you. Thank you.

Oh, it's hard. We just want to continue in the Sahasrara. It's very beautiful. Is it okay if I do a little intro for Leslie? Okay. So, Leslie, can you say hi, then your face will come up.

Hello. Hello, Felicity. So, so excited to be here with you today.

I've known Leslie for nearly 40 years. We first met in North America through Shri Mataji. And so today we've asked you here to share your realization story, what it was like being in North America in those early years, and the Los Angeles collective in particular. Then we'll talk a little bit about helping with puja protocol, which will lead us into talking about the San Diego Puja—the Buddha Puja in San Diego, 1988—and the Lions Bay Puja in 1990, which were, in my feeling, very special, historical pujas. And whatever else that might come out, that Mother might pop into our memories.

So, and then also we say thank you, Sushmita, for making this possible, for all your hard work in setting this up. I'll let you take over from there, Sushmita.

Felicity, Shri Mataji is the doer and she's the enjoyer. And you have been such a wonderful instrument.

No, no, no, stop. No, thank you. Thank you, Leslie, for joining us. So you were born in New Mexico, in America. Is that right?

That's right. Thanks for coming on board for these golden memories.

Would you please share with us where you were when you got your realization? When was it? What time of the year? And if you could, please give us a sense of the collective, the environment around you, because it would help for us and viewers beyond to get a picture. Over to you.

Yes. So to set the scene, I will tell you that it was in 1984, in August. But for the couple of years before that, I was an avid seeker. I was traveling across the United States from the West Coast to the East Coast, East Coast to West Coast. I went back and forth, and I took with me a little microphone and a little cassette player. And in the grocery store or wherever I was, I would go up to people and ask them, "What's the purpose of your life?"

Wow.

"What's the meaning?" I was 19, 20 years old, 20, 21, something like this. And it was just so important to me because I knew that unless I knew that, unless I figured out what the purpose of my life was, I was going to live in nature, away from everyone. I had made some decisions in my life. Every person I asked, I asked so many people, and none of them were quite adequate in my life. They couldn't reach my heart. They had no depth for me. I read a little tiny bit of books, but not too many. Actually, I'm not a real big reader, although I love reading.

But I ended up on the third trip across the country saying to myself, "I'm going to just have to leave this continent because no one here knows the reason they're alive." Right before making real plans—because I had a couple thousand dollars, so I could do something with that—I stopped in upstate New York, just a couple of hours north of Manhattan on the Hudson. There's a place called Rhinebeck. It's a beautiful nature area. Woodstock is right across from it.

Woodstock being where they have that huge music festival. Yes, Woodstock was a big seeking place, really.

Yeah, it really was a seeker's place. On top of that, there was a little camp there—not a camp, but an actual retreat—for people in Manhattan who had money. They could come out to this retreat place and do their spiritual seeking. So I cleaned apartments there. I wanted to take one of the classes, and I really wanted to take this Sufi class because they looked so nice. They were dancing and swirling. I went there and tried, but they were absolutely sold out. It was full.

The only thing that I could take—and that was in exchange for working—was this little seeking through singing. So you sing whatever's in your heart, that kind of thing. So I did it. And in the class, it was nice. You just sing, and then at the end, you get this chance to sing by yourself. So I sang by myself, nothing really special. But afterwards, this girl comes up to me, another student in the class, and she says, "I felt vibrations when you were singing."

Wow.

And I was like, "What? What does that mean?" And she says, "Well, there is this wonderful lady, and she teaches about vibrations. She teaches about healing people. And she's coming next weekend. I don't have a car, and you have a car. Would you like to come?" I'm like, "Of course. That sounds so interesting. I would love to."

So, she says on Saturday morning, "Let's meet, seven in the morning. It's a couple hours' drive. It's not in New York; it's in New Jersey. And so I'll meet you then." We made a place and... she doesn't show up. I'm there at seven waiting. She is not there. And so I get out my journal, and I start to just journal a little bit, write something down. And suddenly there's this huge breeze. And I really feel that's when my Kundalini first started. And I write in my journal, "There's a cool breeze for everyone to feel, as long as they take the time to notice." Because it was a literal cool breeze, but I wrote this at that moment.

I was waiting for her, and then maybe an hour later, she actually showed up. Being a very interesting person, she didn't really know the directions where we were to go. And I was completely thinking, "We will not end up where she means us to go," because she was so scattered. So we got in the car and we started driving, and sort of on vibrations, she said, "Okay, now I think you have to change to this freeway." And I said, "Okay, let's go."

After two hours of driving, we had to get off. "Now, I really think we are close, and I'll just call the person's house," she said. I said, "Okay, fine." So we get off the freeway, we go to a 7-Eleven, which is just a little convenience store. And it's 1984, so there are no cell phones.

No Google to ask.

Well, I think that's why we had to go on vibrations. Even if you'd had the address, there wasn't really a map book that you could follow. America is so vast and not everything is charted on your map books. Wow.

Exactly. And it wasn't in the same state. You know, maybe you have a map of that state, but you don't have a map of the other state. So anyway, we stop at 7-Eleven and she goes, "I'll just go and use the payphone." And I said, "Great." I went inside the store, got a popsicle. I remember it's summer, it's August, it's very humid and hot. So I was eating a popsicle when she came back.

She comes back and she's so excited. She goes, "We could walk there! We could walk there! It's just around the corner!" I'm like, "What? Are you kidding me? That's amazing." She said, "Yeah, I'm also really shocked." Okay, so this is amazing. And I just keep eating my popsicle. She goes, "Well, while you're eating that popsicle, I'm going to tell you three things. Now, you like the clothes you're wearing, right?" And I was wearing a very beautiful dress. I dressed up. And so I said, "Oh, yes, I love how I'm dressed." And she says, "Well, they're all going to wear Indian clothes." And I said, "Okay." And she goes, "Just be comfortable that you're wearing something beautiful because what you're wearing is so beautiful." And I said, "Yes."

Then she said, "The second thing is that they're going to wave their hands around. You know, they're going to do this stuff." And I said, "Okay." She goes, "You can sort of do it with them, but also it's not important. The thing that's really important is the lady who is coming. So don't put too much attention on this other stuff."

Very good advice.

Very good advice. Just wait for the third one.

Oh, okay.

So she says, "The lady who's coming is not there yet." She didn't use her name or anything. She just referred to her as a lady who can heal people. And she had actually healed her. So this was a big deal to her, actually, is that she had some throat issue and it went away completely when Mother worked on her a year or two earlier.

Amazing.

Yes. And so then she says, "The last thing that I'll suggest is that since she's not there right now at the house, the best thing for you to do is just to go and play with the children. You like children, right?" And I go, "Are you kidding? I babysit all the time. I love kids." So that's perfect. And so, what she set me up to do was so perfect because I took the kids for a walk. We played, and it was just a nice time before she arrived.

Then, suddenly, everyone got under the pandal. There was a pandal in the backyard. It was a pretty good-sized backyard. Maybe 100 or 150 people were there.

Well, that's a lot. Yeah, it was a lot. 1984.

Yes. It was the very first international puja in America.

Oh my goodness, you got invited to that straight off. It's lucky you were so young. When you're young like that, you're so open. I went to the birthday puja in India 10 days after my realization, and I just thought, "Oh, this is how they do things." That's amazing.

Incredible. So, it's Shri Krishna puja. Everybody gets in under the pandal, the men on one side, ladies on one side. And I'm pretty far from where the car drives up. So the car drives up, and just the moment someone opens the door and Mother puts one foot down... my Kundalini. And I have these tears of joy and completion. Like, she stands up and she looks at all of us. I'm very, very far away, but I can see her face. And this is what I've been looking for. For two years, I've been looking and asking, and this is it. I know it 100%. There's no thought. There's nothing in my head.

She just comes in and comes through, and the stage is not very high, so she's very close to us on a low stage. I'm just watching her talk, but I don't understand any of the words, but it does not have any effect on my brain. My brain isn't bothered that I don't know anything. My thoughts are absolutely silent, and I can see this light coming out of her. It was just incredible for me, as this fulfillment was happening.

I noticed even while she talked that there were these insects up in the trees behind us. They're called cicadas, and they rub their wings and they make a ton of noise. They were starting to get louder and louder and louder. And pretty soon, Shri Mataji looks up at them, and they go silent. And I knew, I was like, she did that right there. I looked around to see if anybody else noticed, you know, she just made them be quiet.

So these miracles were happening while the talk was going on. I was just getting so into it, and my neck was going back and back. And then pretty soon she says, just to me, "Don't tilt your head back so far. Move your head forward." You know, very clearly. And so I immediately... "Oh, she's giving me instructions."

She's noticing you.

And so all of these things were happening. Then the talk came to an end, and the children started washing her feet. Then someone asked for unmarried ladies to come up. Someone next to me said, "You're not married, right?" "No." They said, "Why don't you go up?" I said, "But I don't know what they're doing." And they said, "Don't worry, they'll show you." I said, "Are you sure?" "Yeah, they'll show you."

So I just went with the flow, and we all were crunched down since the stage was very low, and we sort of two by two or one by one went up. I started to come into action. I started to get worried, like, "I don't know what they're doing, and why would I want to go and make a mess with something I don't know about?" But I couldn't turn around, really. I think there might have been one person behind me or a couple of people behind me. So I just sort of inched forward, and I watched. Mother was talking with someone over there, and no one was giving instructions. Every person was going up there, and I couldn't see exactly, but I could see there were no instructions. So I was kind of getting a little anxiety. And when it became my turn, Shri Mataji stopped, I would say in mid-sentence even. And she bent over very close, and she made sure she pointed to the Alta and the Kumkum. And she showed me exactly where to put it on her foot and how to do it. She made sure I had no questions. It was such an important miracle for me.

It's so beautiful what you're describing because you realize you can be in such a large crowd of people, but Mother, she knows exactly where every single person is, what their thoughts are, what's happening. And I think it's that unconscious connection that you feel, even if you're at the back of the hall and Mother's not looking at you. You are within her attention. And there's this huge security to that, because you know she knows everything that's going on. And gradually you learn that she'll take care of everything. But what a beautiful experience you describe.

Sorry.

No, no, it's just fine. May I just please ask out of curiosity about the light that you first saw around Shri Mataji, and second, how precisely did Shri Mataji ask you to put the Alta and the Kumkum on her lotus feet, please?

You know, I was just looking at Mother's face when she started speaking, and I really felt Christ. I really felt this shining emitting out of Mother's Agnya. And I knew it had something to do with Christ. That's what my absorption of it was. It wasn't like a moment... I mean, never to be forgotten for me, because it was so clear and bright.

It's so sweet because on the subtle level, Shri Mataji, as she explained to us, her body responds to the needs of the seekers. And here you are coming from your Christian background, having grown up with Christ. No doubt we all had blocks in our Agnya. And what does her Agnya do? You know, we know that it's not normal as yogis to see these things, but yet you had that experience, which for you at the time was something very special. And I think Mother gives you that glue when you need it. You know, she goes, "Look. A miracle."

Yes. "Look what I can do." And as far as the specific instruction, I have to say, I mean, I melted when she was... all her attention on me and so close. And so, I don't know if Felicity shared the picture with you.

Yes, yes.

So the picture is exactly of this moment where she's pointing, she's instructing me.

Are you going to show the photo? I think she must be. Yes, the sharing.

And how amazing that someone took a photo at that moment.

That's what I mean. How organized God is. God managed to instruct me in that moment, but at the same time, have someone clicking a photo. She's like connected on the phone to every single person, so she can pull them in there. Oh, wow, look at this.

See how Mother's hand is out? Her hand is literally inches away from mine, and the Alta is there and the Kumkum mix with Alta.

What is Alta?

Alta is a red liquid Kumkum. In Bengal and in India, traditionally married women also wear it. My mom, being very traditional, she would regularly apply that. It's very auspicious. And to do it for Shri Adi Shakti, my God, Leslie, please carry on.

But that is so... it really sets the stage for my realization and my next 10 years. I was so lucky that this happened to me. And then even the next year, in '85 and '86... Where were you? No. So, I'll step back for a moment. After I got my realization, I went home after this puja, and I just opened up my hands. I didn't have any literature about Sahaj. Oh, I had a photograph of Mother because she called all the new people up to her and she gave us two photos. So I had two photos. And I just opened up my hands and I felt absolutely connected with, one with the universe. It was incredible, the feeling after the puja being at home. It just continued.

Somehow this whole concept of vibrations got me hooked in physically. I know that in every atom, there's a vibration, and so mentally I was satisfied as well. So there was this beautiful understanding of vibrations in the very beginning without someone teaching me.

Yes, yes. You experienced it. You actually experienced complete connection with the divine, the Param Chaitanya, the vibrations everywhere, because your Kundalini came up. So beautiful. What is so special also about your story is that later on, sometimes Mother would not encourage new people to be brought to pujas. But in those days, and the same for me in India, she would ask, "Are there any new people at this puja? Come up and wash my feet." It was a standard practice that any new people who had not washed Mother's feet before were to come forward and wash them. Or in your case... And it was, when you hear everybody's stories of the early yogis who came in, all of us have these special moments in the realization story, which shows how the divine is like hand-picking you and giving you exactly the experience you needed so that you go, "This is it. I found it."

Beautiful. Each one of the seekers, each one of us, isn't it? How did the few days unfold for you, Leslie, after this mind-blowing experience? Felicity, it is so nice that she asked you to offer, to apply the Alta and the Kumkum, because I grew up in India, and I always sort of felt my mother was too traditional. I went through this phase of, "It's not modern." And yet, who just makes everything so relevant and so important? So tell us, how did it unfold for you?

It was so natural. Nothing was strange for me. It was so natural. And one of the things when she gave me the two photographs, she asked me what I was going to do next in my life.

Wow.

That was after the puja and she had had dinner. I was thinking of going to Arizona where my grandmother was, so I told her about that and she said that would be very good. So she was in agreement.

The thing that happened during the night is also amazing because she slept in that house. And it was a big house, but this is 150 people or so. And so all the women and children were inside in the rooms, and the guys were out in the pandal. When we went to sleep, I looked in each of the rooms. I didn't see any place for me to go and lie down. I had these two photos. I actually had no plan to stay there, so I didn't have a change of clothing or anything. I just laid down in the hallway, right outside of Mother's bedroom.

Sorry, could you...? The last thing we heard you say was, "I laid down in front of Mother's door," and then you froze.

Okay. And then my Vishuddhi started to open. It began pulsating like opening, closing, opening, and it actually began to hurt. So I remember in the night, I just had that photograph, one of the photographs, and I just kept it right there, like maybe that would help. It just was a tremendous opening. And I knew where this chakra was, definitely. The vibration was so amazing. It really, really, really changed my life.

What ended up happening is instead of going to Arizona, when I got home, a couple of weeks later, I gave my car to that beautiful person who took me there. And I got on a plane and flew back to Huntington Beach, just south of Los Angeles where my parents were.

And what was your plan? You just... you didn't have a plan. You just felt that's where you wanted to be at this point?

Yeah. So what had happened is, I knew my grandmother wasn't well. As I was flying, my grandmother passed away. And so that was the... it was an open... And she was a very important person for spirituality in my life. She took me to the church. My parents weren't religious at all. So it kind of all happened together. She passed on.

At that point, because you had no literature or information, usually when someone gets their realization, we emphasize, "Try and meditate morning and evening, even if it's five minutes." Did you do any of those things? What was your routine like?

Yes. I mean, when I woke up, it was the first thing I wanted to do, automatically, naturally. Because being a thirsty seeker, it was no question in my mind that this was the most important thing that I could do. So I would wake up and sit for not too long, I would say 20, 30 minutes, nothing outlandish or anything. And I could just, without any information, I could feel it, of course, from the puja time.

My idea when I got there... I had met one girl who was also fairly new. Her name was Elizabeth Palumbo, I think. And so my plan was, when I got to Los Angeles, I would try to find her, and we would at least meditate together. That's all my plan was. So now, I knew that I could go back to a big city, and I knew I would be all right in a big city because I suddenly knew the purpose of life. Actually, at that point, I wouldn't say that I knew the purpose of life, but I had this experience.

Meaning had come into your life. Suddenly, meaning had come into your life. It was worth living.

Yeah. And it wasn't intellectual, so that's why I couldn't say it. I couldn't say what the meaning of my life was.

Yeah. So, I think that's it. You have such a strong experience. It was the same for me in India, that you go beyond your mind. You actually can't think or plan about anything. You're just in the vibrations, and you just kind of go with the flow, and the divine just takes you. And actually, that's how we want to be now, all the time. But between that experience, suddenly all this life starts coming in, and we forget. But that is actually the state. Because when you're in that state, you can still live life, do things, but your brain is not planning at all. Because it doesn't know what to do at that point. You've kind of kicked it out and jumped into this other atmosphere, this other level. So I can quite understand how you just flowed down to L.A., and you just kind of knew it was all going to unfold in front of you, but you couldn't put it into words.

No, no, no.

It's something akin to when we went to... when we took our elder child, Vinay, to ISPS, the Sahaj school in Dharamshala. And remember, they go pretty early. It wasn't easy as a mum. But as soon as we crossed the big gate and entered the school, it was like the top of my head had just gone. It was just vibrations. I mean, it was just such an experience that you just knew. I haven't been in that state many a time. That was the first. And it was like, "Gosh, what would it be like to live in that state?" It's just completely being her child and her instrument, isn't it? This is the bliss that she talks about.

This is the bliss. Yes, absolutely. So then I found Elizabeth, and we both decided that we would move into the L.A. ashram. The L.A. ashram at that time was a little house that was on a street in between Sunset Boulevard and Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood.

Oh, wow.

So Sunset had so much drugs. It was just a mess on Sunset Boulevard. And on Santa Monica, it was an even worse mess. It was prostitution and everything. It was quite a hell of a place to move into. But for me, I had seen everything already. I had lived in Hollywood before, four years earlier. I had seen it all. So nothing shocked me. But we had three families in that ashram, a couple of single people, and a newborn baby.

Oh, and that's a lot of people.

Yeah. For us, it was a lot of people. Mother never came there, and it served as a place for me to come, and Elizabeth also. And then I found out about the India tour. So, in August I got realization. By the end of September, I moved into the ashram. By October, I had heard about the India tour. So, why not? Let's do this. I have that couple thousand dollars. This must be what it's for. So I went to Bordi, and I got married.

How old were you at this point?

This is 22.

We did get married much younger then than they do now.

Oh, and it was incredible. It was wonderful. It was just more than I expected in my life, ever. It was an incredible experience. But when I came home, within six months, we closed that ashram because it was just horrendous, vibrationally. It was very, very difficult for us because the area where the ashram was was very heavy.

Yes. And you must have been clearing all the time.

No, it was absolutely the way it was. We were clearing 100% of the time. Yogis would come from San Diego on the weekend sometimes, but they would get all caught up, and then they would go back home to clear out. It was too much.

In those days, the collective in San Diego was a little bit more established. It was like we were an outpost, and they were the main base. There they had maybe already as many as 20 yogis.

And that was a good number for those days.

Absolutely. It was an established collective. So, in mid-'85, we started to go in that direction. One couple, and us, another, and then a single guy, we moved down halfway in between L.A. and San Diego. Then we moved to San Diego. There wasn't an ashram in Los Angeles from mid-1985 all the way until 1990. There was no ashram in L.A. It was just too much. We had closed it down, and we couldn't manage to go back. I guess that's why we had the Buddha puja in San Diego.

Let's hear you talk about puja protocol and how you learned about that through Madhuri's mum. How did that come about?

Yeah. So she came to live with us.

You were living in San Diego, and that's where Madhuri and Dave were, and the core group were there. And her mummy came to live from India.

Her mummy came from Pune in 1985. In 1986, I think. She came for a visit first, and then a year later or something, she came to live with us. She was a very Maharashtrian, strict woman.

Disciplined.

Yes, she was very, very, and very aware of puja protocol. She had been with Mother so much in India.

Had she actually been like an attendant on Shri Mataji? Because sometimes Shri Mataji would have ladies come and be with her so she could teach them.

Absolutely. She was right there with Mother so often, and at many, many pujas. So she had quite... and it wasn't just for puja. That was one part of what she taught us, was bhakti.

Bhakti being devotion.

So, our devotion. She taught us... I mean, you can't teach this, but she basically got us, me especially, to be humble. It was a breaking of my ego, one hundred percent. People in the ashram would ask me, "Why do you let her speak to you like that?" I said, "She's my auntie. That's okay. This is good for me."

Give us an example.

Oh, what I thought of is so mundane, but it was something in the kitchen, something with pots and pans. And I am so reckless in the kitchen a bit. And so, of course, I needed lots of correcting. So that was the other side of it, not just our bhakti, but the dharma of regular life, what is good. She had a lot of guidance for me.

Because many of the early young yogis in those days were very undisciplined in themselves. They came out of the hippie time, seventies into the early eighties, and there still was this sense of, "You just do what you feel like," I think. So that's why she was giving guidance as to how you can enjoy the spiritual life more if you have some discipline, some dharma, some maryadas in your life—not just in the meditation, but in the kitchen.

Yeah. So how did it manifest? What was the advice, and what were your lessons you took that people watching could actually take, particularly about doing pujas? Because of course, in those days, we didn't know anything about doing pujas.

Or even... well obviously, you, Leslie, had this incredible experience where you could feel what the bliss of puja can be. Not everybody gets that experience. But then the puja protocols and things are designed to... Mother says puja is for us. God doesn't need pujas, but puja is for us because when we praise the divine, when we praise the Devi, then the divine is pleased with that recognition and that respect, and the vibrations start to flow. And as they flow more, they clear us inside. So we get addicted to puja because we feel so much better afterwards. So in her showing you how to do things in a nice way, it nurtures that experience and that process of puja.

It's very sweet because you're going to share a little bit about what she said in the early days. But we also know that puja has to come from the heart. You know these things, this is what we're going to do, how to paint and wash, but it's so important for it not to be a ritual, that it has to come... you're doing it because you love Mother or because of your love for the divine. And that's when you get the vibrations, the blessings.

So sorry, Leslie.

Again, this is the most important part. This is what I learned very deeply, and I, of course, pass it on to everyone. In the next ten years, I would many times come to an international puja in the U.S. and be expected to get other ladies to prepare the puja articles and to welcome Mother, actually. I would have to teach it many times to many yoginis. And this was the essence of everything that I would ever teach anyone: that it has to be your creative heart. It has to come from this unlimited place inside of you.

So if someone felt afraid of making the arati tray because they wanted to do it exactly right, it was always my love that I could say, "You can be creative with it. You can make it how your heart feels it." I mean, yes, of course, you want to have incense and you want to have the ingredients, but with your heart. It doesn't even have to have creativity, but if it does, it's so nice when it has that little—or a lot—of creativity also, from your spirit.

That's so nice to hear. That's so special.

I've seen... I remember saying it to one lady, exactly this scenario. She was an artist, or she is an artist. For her, when she heard me explain it to her like that, she just relaxed. And then years later, she did a painting that represents that creativity that she felt in those moments. So it has repercussions, our beautiful words or our understanding of bhakti, of this beautiful puja protocol. Yes, there are many, many very specific ingredients, but the real joy is through this heart of ours.

Because we have a little book called Puja Protocols. Another important thing which we noticed over the years was that Sahaja Yoga is not Hinduism. So often, we would get people coming from India, lovely yogis, but they would bring their traditions and their things they'd grown up with, thinking, "Oh, this is how it's supposed to be done." But actually, my understanding is Shri Mataji would frequently change the order of things, change how they were done in puja, break all our conditionings. I mean, obviously, you would have amrut and you would have water and these kinds of things, but she said that it's not Hinduism. The root of Sahaja Yoga is an organic process that comes through the heart, out of love.

Here, what can I say? We need to know those protocols from you, because if you would be so kind as to share them. Shri Mataji is the only incarnation who has taken the pains to explain A to Z to the Western yogis, children in the West, and also the yogis in the East, in India and other countries where they have known pujas from ancient times. It's very important to remember that it's all a semblance and integration of all the religions and not to take it in one direction or the other. I suppose for the Indians coming, that's the bhakti they know. So that's a very fine line between ritualism and bhakti, isn't it? What they're doing is probably their devotion, and what we do here in the West is from our heart as well and our understanding of that. Would you please explain to us, as Felicity has requested, those minor details which we want to keep for posterity, essentially? Because it's unparalleled and it's just timeless.

It's very true that this is something that will go on and on and on. And I would say that as simple as when you offer incense at your altar to Mother's photograph, this is puja. Even if you don't do anything else, this is puja, if your heart and your devotion is there. So, puja is many things.

I won't go into details because the details did change, as Felicity was mentioning. Mother was very... it was interesting. In the '80s, Mother was letting pujas be quite long. We took a lot of time. I mean, in this puja that we wanted to speak about in Vancouver, in Lions Bay, I think to paint her feet took an hour, maybe. Just one little part of it. Maybe it felt like that to me on the stage. But sometimes the pujas would last forever. But I saw as the years started to go on, Mother sped it up herself. She changed it. And as you were saying, she changed many things.

But she always kept within me this feeling that anything is possible. One time, a little example: there was a problem with the jewelry. I think the anklet wouldn't clasp. And no matter how we tried, we couldn't get it. So I went off the stage to try to find something to make it stay. What am I going to look for? I don't even know what I'm going to look for. I go off, but I know she has full control. When I get off the stage, the first person I meet, this guy, I said, "I'm looking for something to fix the jewelry." And he just goes in his pocket and he pulls out a little wire. I go back on the stage, and boop boop, it's fixed.

Amazing.

And that's like, over and over, it was fluid. There's another special moment for me personally, where it was a welcome arati for Mother on the East Coast. She's walking up the steps. She sees that we have a garland and an arati, but then she sees that we also have some milk in a copper vase. She just takes off her shoes and she goes and stands on the grass. We didn't have a thali or anything for her to stand in. I'm not sure what we were thinking about, but she just stood in the grass, and we got to massage her feet and wash her feet with milk. It was absolutely just like nature for me. It was like nature and my love of nature. There is no more special thing to me than Mother's feet in the grass.

Remind us please, what time and where?

So this would be around '88, maybe '88 or '89. And it would be... I think it's a house that belonged to Danny and Marsha, but I'm not entirely sure. So I don't know the details. I've forgotten the details. But it was a beautiful experience to do all of this and to welcome her, just to greet her.

It is so important what you're sharing. I think what Sushmita has been wanting you to say is that when you do puja, you have the water, you wash Mother's feet, and then maybe we offer the amrut. There's a certain order to it. And we wash that, and then the unmarried young girls come up and they paint her feet. And that's changed, the order of that has changed over time too. Then the married ladies come and they offer the jewelry and the sari, and the girls do the Kumkum and the perfume. Then there comes the jewelry, the sari, the crown, and then the arati. I'm kind of shortening it a bit.

But what you're sharing with us is that there is a sort of an order to it. And certainly, this must also have been what Madhuri's mummy, Auntie Sheryu, taught. But what you're sharing with us is that actually, it's not important what you do, it's how you are doing it in every part. Somebody else I asked to share about puja, who had been a pujari in Cabella a lot, I asked, "What are the protocols?" And he goes, "Love." That's what he said. He said, "Love."

Pasquale, that's the right answer.

Yeah. And Pasquale said every puja was different. They'd have different materials or different things. It's become more standardized in a way over time, but when Mother was there, there would be lots of variations, and she would call for different things. So it's really important for us not to... yes, we should be aware and know and we can follow a pattern that is nice because it gives structure to us offering puja to Mother. We have a structure in our heads.

But the most important thing... just when we were reading mantras in the early years, I remember being in a room with Mother at a seminar, and she asked one of the yoginis to read, I think it was a prayer or a passage. It was something to do with Jesus. They read it very nicely, and then Mother said, "Now read it with your heart." And then she reread it, and Mother said, "See the vibrations." The same thing, when we were reading mantras at a puja, Mother stopped us and she said, "Say them through your heart." You just cannot underestimate the importance of taking that time to feel the love, to feel that gratitude. That's what it is.

It is so important because it's so easy for the mind to come in the way, and suddenly the process becomes the ritual. The love and the gratitude sort of recede a bit. There are lots of people who are newer who come in and are worried that they're going to do the wrong thing. Because we're so conditioned to think there's a right way to do things, we must do things properly, or the divine will not be happy with us. And actually, it's not really the case if you're sincere and honest and you do it with your heart. That's why I think some people get really caught into the ritual of it. "Oh, we must do it like this." I noticed because I traveled between Canada, Europe, England, and America, I got to see different collectives and ashrams doing their pujas differently. Sometimes the order of things was done differently. In Vancouver, for some reason, we didn't have young girls painting Mother's feet like we do in England. We just had the ladies, the Lakshmis, would come up and paint and put the perfume and the Kumkum and the sandalwood, and they would do all of that.

But that was actually everywhere, Felicity. Even with Mother there, for many, many pujas, it was like that.

But what I noticed was the vibrations were still deep. Even though the processes were a little bit different, at first your brain goes, "Oh, they're doing it differently," you think, "Oh, they're not doing it the right way." And then you go, "Oh, hang on a minute," and you let go of that idea and you see the vibrations are there. For whatever reason, this is it.

It's so important. It reminded me of this conversation we were at Blossom Farm at the last puja. I think it was Diwali puja if I remember correctly. And Shankarji was talking to Pasquale, who's been the pujari with his elder brother, Antonio. He said the same thing about love being the most important element. And also, he'd mentioned how when he attended pujas in India, it was the ladies preparing everything and doing the puja, and the men would just come and offer the amrut.

I mean, that's how it was here also. It was the ladies. We really hope to do one session with him and Antonio. But please tell us about your experiences, because you were one of those lucky ladies, shall we say, Felicity, to do the puja. I mean, both of you. Those days, the proximity to Shri Mataji, doing it... it's almost unreal today.

Felicity, we wanted to talk about two pujas. Shall we move into the Buddha Puja in San Diego? Because then you can give specific details of what you were doing on the stage. I wanted to pick up on that feeling when you were saying it was so fluid and you were flowing through it all. What I noticed was that after the puja part had finished, we would have the opportunity to line up and come up and give Mother flowers or gifts. And I noticed, time and time again, that as you got closer and closer to the stage, you would step onto the stage and you were in this bubble of vibrations. You stepped into this holy world, and there was a physicality, like a weight, to the vibrations.

So tell us about this. This is the Buddha Puja, 1988, on the beach, on the sand.

I know, this is incredible as it is. A public beach in San Diego.

A public beach. I mean, it's amazing. San Diego.

And did you have to have permission to set up the tent?

We did. Yeah. So we got permission to set up a big tent. And then we built this giant paper-mache Bodhi tree that you can see in this picture.

That's incredible that you found this picture. This is the tree that Buddha... after Buddha had gone everywhere and searched and searched and searched, and Mother says, in exhaustion, he sat down under this tree and kind of gave up. And then, bing, he got his enlightenment. Then he became known as the Gautama Buddha. He got his enlightenment under the Bodhi tree, and this is what you created for this very special occasion.

We tried. I mean, I don't think the leaves are right, and I think there are a few things that could have been better. But yes, it was super, super heavy and super big.

And you said that it's real grass you created?

That is real grass. Yes, nothing artificial about the grass. We got turfs of it, I don't know how many, to create it.

That's beautiful, isn't it? You've got the ocean on one side, and then it's part of a beach park, so there's a road on the other side. Those of us who had traveled—we'd driven down from Vancouver, and there were lots of little children; we had a five-year-old and a three-year-old in the car—we set up tents beside the pandal on the beach.

I can't remember what kind of facilities there were. They were very basic. But it was an international Buddha Puja, wasn't it, Leslie?

Yes, yes. It was international. And yes, we had many tents that we set up for people as well who didn't bring their own. During this puja, I was behind this Bodhi tree. So while Mother was talking, I could not see anything that was going on in front of Mother. I couldn't see Mother, actually. There's a point during the talk where she asks for some water.

There's no table on the Bodhi tree stage? So you were actually there because usually at pujas, Mother has a lady nearby if she needs water or cough sweets or something. So that's why you were like Shri Hanuman, waiting in case Mother needed something.

I wish I was like Hanuman, because instead, I was exhausted and I was sleepy, almost sleeping. And so the tent that is right behind this banged against my back Agnya nicely, boing, boing. And when it hit me, I came alert and I realized that Mother needed water. Only because of the tent, nobody was telling me or anything. I remember I had just a mug, not even a nice crystal or silver glass. I had a mug that I took with water, and I had to hobble up that grass step. I didn't want to come right in front of her, so it was more like crawling up the grass. It was very difficult, I just remember, in a sari.

In the sari, do not forget about the sari. It's important. Are there more stories about this Bodhi tree? How long did it take to make? It's beautiful, isn't it?

Well, it's very beautiful that Mother, when she walked into the pandal, she immediately knew what we wanted to do. That was actually the beautiful part. She says to Dave, "Oh, the Bodhi tree." So it was incredible that she knew our hearts. But it didn't take us long. We did it very quickly. In those days, in those early pujas, there was a lot of creativity that went into creating a backdrop or a stage that represented the quality of the deity of that puja. That was a large part of it, wasn't it?

I remember that there were public programs at this puja also, but I don't think we had any evening program. It was very hot to start with. I remember being in the tent and thinking, with two small children, "How are we going to manage in this heat?" And then, within a very short time, this wind came up. This wind blew and blew, and at times we wondered if the tents were going to get blown away. But everybody felt this was Sri Hanuman, and that he had brought the wind because it cooled things down. It lasted throughout the puja, till the day after the puja. I think it was recorded as unusual winds at that time by the weather people. So the winds played a huge role.

Absolutely. So we're talking about May, June, 1988, Shri Buddha Puja, isn't it?

Yes. I think it was before Krishna puja, so either July, end of July. Because after the puja, we were driving back up to Vancouver, and people kept saying to us, "You've got suitcases on the roof. You must be careful, it's so windy." And you're going up the motorway. So my husband really tied these suitcases on tight. We had a whole suitcase for my daughter, who was about to go to the Rome school. We didn't have an extra set of clothes, so we brought everything that she was to take, all named, ready to go with her to the school in about two weeks.

We drove back up the motorway, aware of this wind that was following us. We must have gotten halfway, up to San Francisco or somewhere, and we stopped and we realized the suitcase had blown off the top. And we couldn't... I remember my husband going, "I can't understand how this happened. I tied it so well." And I just felt, "I think she needed new clothes to go for a fresh start at her school," not to take any clothes with old vibrations, sort of thing. But you really felt the power of the presence of Sri Hanuman. He is the son of Vayu, Vayu is the wind god. So it was really a puja of elements, wasn't it? We had the ocean there, the warm ocean down in San Diego to foot soak in. It was very fresh.

The other thing, Leslie, I was remembering was that at the beginning, before the puja, before Mother came, a call went out amongst the ladies, "Do you have any saris that you could share that could decorate the pandal?" Most ladies came forward and gave a sari to be used, to be hung up at the back. Do you remember that, Leslie?

Yes. No, we needed them also. And shawls, saris, anything. We needed them to guide the steps of the Adi Shakti.

Oh, to lay down as she came in?

She came in through the back of the pandal, through the sand.

So it was not a time to be very selective, to be honest. We were on the beach, and you could say we were having a picnic in a way. I mean, we were having a puja, but we needed anything that anyone had. And yes, if it was unused, that is of course...

No, I mean, everyone had come with what they were planning to wear. I remember feeling like, "Oh, how can I give this?" But they need it. I didn't have... I gave a very plain, silk, printed sari. Other people gave very beautiful, gold-embroidered saris to hang up. At the end of the puja, I went up to ask... I can't remember if it was you, Leslie, I spoke to... and I said, "The saris were coming down." I'd noticed in the puja because it was a special thing, you give a sari for use in the puja, it gets vibrated, and then you have this sari to take home. I looked, and I noticed that mine hadn't been used. I couldn't see it. And I just felt, "That's okay. You offered, and it wasn't very beautiful, and they didn't use it. That's fine."

So I sort of humbly went up to the stage and said, "Could I... I've come to collect my sari, and I know it didn't get used, and it's okay." And I'm sure it was you, and you just turned to me and you turned to the stage and you go, "Oh yes, it was used to wrap around the cushion under Shri Mataji's feet." And I just... I was like, "Under Mother's feet." Can you imagine? It was such a blessing. I just went... I took the sari, and I remember just putting it on my head again, and I took it home, and I never wore that again. I've kept it.

We needed a combination of decorations, a combination of something for the floor, because there was no floor, it was just sand. And Mother walked the whole way from the back to the stage, so it was a long distance. The pandal was pretty big. So we needed a lot of material. And some of the saris were hung from the back of the pandal, like wall hangings.

So they were decorating the back behind Shri Mataji, or along the sides.

Yes, along the sides, to try to be creative, to make a more auspicious, beautiful place for the Goddess to come.

Yes, this puja picture of Shri Mataji, it's a very unusual, very deep blue, isn't it? Navy blue.

I think it was possibly one of the first Buddha pujas in America, so this was extremely important because it's the ego. Of course, America is Shri Krishna's center, Vishuddhi, but as Mother said again and again, the ego in America was a big problem. So we knew this was a very important puja to have in America to bring down the ego. It was very beautiful what Gregoire read about all the evils that man has done. "Please rectify them, please remove them, please reverse them." It was a really...

So this is when this was first read to Mother at the puja, this prayer to undo the evil that man has done.

Yes. And there were like, it must have been 50 or 60 sentences, every single thing that you could... affecting pollution, nature, politics. And at the end, it finished with, "Please, Shri Mataji, undo the evil that man has done." So it's very... I mean, it's worth saying these days.

Absolutely relevant.

It was very beautiful, and I remember Mother being moved by it. It touched her that we had recognized this and we were asking for this.

And so, at this puja, you were also... Mother was, you were an instrument up there to help guide the ladies coming up to paint Mother's feet. Is this something that Madhuri's mummy showed you, how to paint Mother's feet?

Absolutely. How to be at the service of Mother during puja. Yes. And how to guide, how to help, in the same way that she had instructed you, you are now passing this on. Because you never knew who was going to come up, who was new, who didn't know how to paint Mother's feet or which finger to put in the Kumkum even to paint it with. And so she told you those things.

Yes, yes. She really taught us everything. Meaning, you can put saffron in with the elements. There are many, many alternatives and many ways to do it.

So when you're offering the amrut—the yogurt, the ghee, the sugar, the honey, the milk—you can sometimes add saffron. Sometimes you have Kumkum or different things.

You wouldn't ever offer Kumkum in it, no. But you would offer something that's like a beautiful recipe. So Mother would actually make the amrut. It was a creation. It wasn't just this, this, and this. If she wanted more milk, you better have more milk. If she wanted more yogurt, you should have lots of yogurt. At that moment, she would be saying, "Okay, bring more milk. Pour more milk. Bring more yogurt. Pour more yogurt."

And then you would end up with this bowl, as you said, like the recipe concocted by the Adi Shakti, which we would then drink afterwards.

Just awesome. In the early days, did Shri Mataji use the five elements with her hands? Or had we already transformed to worshipping Shri Mataji's holy lotus feet?

So it depended on Shri Mataji. Sometimes she would want to do it with her hands, and sometimes we would do it on her feet. We would offer the elements, everyone offered, and then still, she would want to do it with her hands.

Lovely. What were the preparations involved? You mentioned how in India, the ladies would prepare for the puja, and then the men would come up and offer the elements. Could you tell us the behind-the-scenes preparation, please?

So in America, we would ask guys, of course, to help us with the polishing and some of the things, but there were a few ladies, and we were very much... we had inventory. We were very precise. There were lists upon lists upon lists that were very specific. If the puja was on the East Coast, I would call ahead to, let's say, Christine Kirby. She was someone who helped me, and she would go and buy the quantities needed of yogurt, of milk, the fruit, the elements, and how many coconuts we would need.

And you would call her because the puja was going to be on the East Coast, and you would tell her what they needed to buy to have ready for the puja. Wow, a lot of preparation.

It was very interesting. And then in our luggage, we would bring all the silver from the West Coast to the East Coast, to Kanajoharie. At that time, there was only one set of puja silver, and that traveled around. Because the time period we're talking about is when Shri Mataji would come to North America. Nearly always, she went to the four cities: New York, Toronto, Vancouver, L.A. And she always had a puja in either New York or L.A., sometimes both, but usually just one. And sometimes she would have one in Canada too. She literally would bandhan around the country.

Sometimes she would go one way, and sometimes she would go the other way. I know because we were always connected with L.A., either she would go to L.A. first and then come to Vancouver, so we would have to wait for her. Or we would go from Vancouver down to L.A. But wherever the puja was at that time, we would all travel to the puja, either by plane or by driving down the West Coast, because this was the only time we would get to see Shri Mataji in that year. Very few people were able to travel to Europe or anything like that.

As yogis, there were very few who were financially flushed enough to attend all the pujas all the time. To make the best opportunity of being with Shri Mataji when she visited America and Canada, how did it work out for you all? Like, you just prayed to the divine and it just flowed? Or did you have to tame the mental forces to surrender to the divine, to be the instrument? How did that pan out? How did it go for you, Felicity?

For me... I'm American, and I'm a big believer in the credit system.

Flights within America weren't that expensive in those days, I think too.

I think they were.

We had a family, so if it was a puja on the East Coast, we didn't always go because we knew Mother was coming to Vancouver anyway, because of the finances. If it was in L.A., we just got in the car. It's 3,000 miles, it's a long way, and it would take two to three days. We would stop with yogis in Oregon, in Corvallis, or sometimes in San Francisco. We would just put the kids in, put the tents in the car, and we would just drive. That was it. That's when you took your holidays, because Mother was coming. There was just no question about it. If we felt that we really needed to fly and to be there, we would just pray for cheap tickets to come up. That year they did The Magic Flute in Kanajoharie, we got this incredible deal, like $200 a ticket or something, and we managed. It's like now, you have the desire, you pray.

I learned by around the mid-1990s that the credit card wasn't the best idea. It took me a really long time to learn that.

Shri Mataji said to me when I was trying to send my eldest son to the Sahaj school, I asked permission if he could go, and she said, "Yes." And then she said, "If you have the money." So you're not supposed to put yourself in debt. But sometimes, when you make a decision that you really want to go, then the money comes through unexpected avenues. But you have to commit. Once you've committed, then it comes together. But it's a balance. We can't take things for granted.

It's important. Having grown up in India with my parents, they would spend as much as they would be comfortable with. They wouldn't be extravagant or wasteful. It's just knowing those boundaries. I've grown up with that, but I don't necessarily live with those.

I think you have to try to be sensitive inside now, to feel what is comfortable and be guided by your Nabhi, by your dharma.

Should we move on to Lions Bay, and Leslie can share more stories through talking about the Lions Bay puja? Do you think we have time?

Yes, if you're up for it. Let's continue.

Okay. So, why don't you tell us, Leslie, about you coming up for the puja?

Well, as you said, if the puja was on the West Coast, whether it's in Vancouver or San Diego, L.A., I pretty much always was going to the puja on the West Coast. So Vancouver was a no-brainer. I'll drive for 24 hours. That's non-stop. It used to take a few days because we had children and we couldn't really do that. But it was not a question for me. It was a good drive, and when we got there, it was just beautiful. The nature is the most beautiful nature in the world, I think. This Lions Bay... there are two lions in the mountains, the mountains are in the shape of lions.

At the beginning of the puja, Mother says, "This must be the most beautiful ashram in the world at the moment."

Wow.

Yes. So, this is about 20 minutes, half an hour north of the city of Vancouver. The ashram was on the side of the mountain along the coastal road that goes from Vancouver up to Whistler. You climbed up this steep, steep drive to get to the ashram. This house and the kitchen had L-shaped windows all the way down one side and all the way along the front. You would look out every day and you would have a view like this. It would change every day. The weather would change, the sky would look different, the clouds... it was like having your own personal, living painting that changed all the time. It was very peaceful. At the back were pine forests. We were on the edge of this mountainside, underneath... these were swayambhus, Mother said, the lion mountains.

This is the view from the beach down below the village of Lions Bay. So we were up on the mountainside, and you went down to the beach. We were kind of behind one of these mountains that face each other in the same way that the lions in Trafalgar Square in London, the big statues, are on their haunches, sitting with their heads facing forward. These two mountains were facing each other. Shri Mataji said this was a swayambhu that was protecting the city of Vancouver. We never really had false gurus in the city of Vancouver; they never took hold. Whereas in Victoria, which was across the water on the island, they had so much witchcraft and false gurus settling down there. So it was a real blessing for the city to have these mountains protecting us. And this ashram was right on the back of it. The First Nations had a lovely story about how these mountains were created.

You get out of the city of Vancouver and you start driving up, and that's what it looks like, these incredible mountains. When I first moved there from England, I just kept saying to my husband, "I can't believe you grew up in a place like this." Coming out of London, it's just so beautiful.

Then Shri Mataji gives this talk. We heard that it was going to be an international Saraswati Puja, and I thought, "Yeah, I've never been to a Saraswati Puja, how special is that?" We did have leaders come from France and other countries, and leaders came from all the different states in America for the puja. In the talk, Mother's talk, she talks about nature and Saraswati and creativity. It's a really important, really deep talk.

But maybe we could move into talking about the lightning storm. Did it happen before or after?

It happened before the puja, because Mother talked about it in the puja. That's right, it was the night before. If you look on Amruta and you watch... at the beginning, they've actually got footage of the night before, the afternoon as they are setting up a small pandal in the garden. You can see the sky, it looks like it's twilight, it looks like it's dusk because this rainstorm started gathering. They actually had to stop at one point because it was raining so much.

Yes. I mean, I was mostly in the house preparing, so I wasn't so much in the decorating outside.

You were preparing for the puja. What were you doing?

Just polishing silver and basically getting the utensils ready. I don't remember if we started to have a little bit of an entertainment program before, or how it started, but at some point, we were singing for Mother. We were all in the meditation room. The house was given to Shri Mataji for her stay, for her visit. That was her bedroom. And only leaders or people she asked to see went into that room. The rest of us that evening were downstairs meditating in the meditation room.

All I remember is the very amazing moment that some of us who were in the room upstairs with the glass windows, the glass view... my attention is very often on nature, so I must have been staring out of the windows. Suddenly, the electricity of the house went out.

That's right. And also, the sky turned... because it was dusk and the sun was setting, the sky went this incredible peach color. Afterwards, we were told that there was a prophecy of the First Nation Indians that said when the sky turns this color, the Great Mother is coming. And it was like a color you can't... we've all seen incredible sunsets, and that was just this deep peach tinged with pink.

Absolutely. So when the electricity went out, we put so many candles around in Mother's room. It wasn't enough to really make a dent, but what did make a dent was when the lightning started. It wasn't super close to us; it was in the distance. So you've got a flash of lightning... I mean, the thunder happened first and then the flash of lightning. To be sitting with the divine, and we started singing, to have this beautiful, powerful announcement that she's here... it wasn't just one lightning strike. It went on and on and on.

Later the next day... it was actually a dry lightning storm, the rain wasn't at that time. In the newspaper, they recorded the lightning strikes. They recorded 16,000 lightning strikes that had gone from Vancouver down to Seattle, just this part of the coastline. Someone also said that they saw, maybe you were there, that she seemed to be orchestrating it. She would just be like, suddenly she'd be flashing her arm and then the lightning would come.

This I didn't notice, but that is the feeling.

Yes. So maybe we can play the talk now. We're going to play the first eight minutes of this talk, where she talks about this lightning storm and why it was so important and so significant.

Shri Mataji: When they asked me what puja we should have in Vancouver, I had heard about this ashram that it is placed in very beautiful surroundings of nature. And as nature is being created by the power of Saraswati, I thought best would be to have the puja of Saraswati here. Another thing is that when people live in nature, they become extremely creative. Their delicate feelings are preserved. And they are never in a rush, or they are not what we can call too much modernized because nature suits them now. So also, the creativity of Saraswati adds to artists. And I knew that there must have been many artists in this country created since long. Canada, as such, I feel, is the Hamsa Chakra of the Vishuddhi.
But the power of Saraswati becomes Mahasaraswati when it is manifested by the Mahabrahma Deva, which is called as Hiranya Garbha. For that, she has to cross through the Hamsa. She crosses through Hamsa and becomes the Vishnumaya Shakti. Saraswati becomes the Vishnumaya. She crosses at two points, one at Hamsa and another at Vishuddhi. So she is the sister of Shri Krishna.
So Saraswati was born as the sister of Shri Krishna. And when Kansa came to kill her, she just rose into the sky and became the lightning. And she declared the coming of Shri Krishna, that He is already there, existing. So the relationship between Shri Krishna and Vishnumaya is that of a brother and a sister. And surprisingly, the other day, we celebrated the Rakhi Bandhan, Rakshabandhan, which is the same thing as the brother-sister's relationship. So now here we are celebrating, actually, the deity which is the sister of Shri Krishna.
Later on, she was born as Draupadi. And that's why Shri Krishna went to save her chastity. Because it is the brother only who is concerned about the chastity and the name of the sister. So this is what happened yesterday, the Saraswati poojan. So Vishnumaya herself yesterday, sixteen hundred times thundered here. And I didn't tell anybody what was happening, but I knew she would do that. And apart from that, she has also threatened Washington. That's a good thing, because Washington has to be awakened.
Now, these are very, very subtle things and very subtle relations, and only I can tell these things because I know them, that these relations exist. So I was not surprised that she was there. But exactly sixteen hundred times she blasted this part of Vancouver is to show that the time has come for you to understand that Sahaja Yoga is so important. And if we do not assert ourselves fully to Sahaja Yoga, Vishnumaya is going to take another form, which may burn all your forests, may burn everything.
Now you must know that lightning represents all the five elements in it. It has sound, it has light, it is in the ether, it acts in the ether. Also, it has got the water in it. And when the water goes into friction, which is the Mother Earth. So all these things act through her. So this Vishnumaya yesterday showed us that, "I am here now. Please worship me."
And so far, we have never worshipped Saraswati. And Brahma Deva is not worshipped anywhere because he created this world. He created all these woods and all these things, and they created all the seas and all the lands, all the stars, universes after universes. But we are not to worship them. We worship this tree or that tree. We are not to worship anything of that kind. Only thing, whatever is created by Mother Earth, like swayambhus, that's only we worship. And that too we worship now in an abstract way because wherever they have appeared, people are doing commercial religion, so we don't go to these places also as Sahaja Yogis. So you can understand why all these things happen unexpectedly. Yesterday after my coming, that there was such a light of lightning which never happened before, and people were surprised.
So it is Krishna's sister, who is a much more dynamic and much more fiery personality. Much, much more fiery personality. Shri Krishna's essence is His sweetness, His Madhurya. But she is the one who warns. And that is how the warning came. And she is a very fiery personality which warns everyone. So on one way, she has proved my coming here, that I am here. Perhaps maybe to the people who are aboriginals, they might understand that this is what was prophesized and that has happened. And also, that you people have to realize it's a warning, that you cannot just allow Sahaja Yoga to drift in such a manner that it takes its own course and you are just by the way there. So this is a warning of Shri Krishna's sister, Vishnumaya, which is Saraswati herself. And that is what today we are going to worship her.
Only the Sahaja Yogis, those who are enlightened people, can worship Mahasaraswati. Otherwise, people can only worship Saraswati. Because with the worship of Saraswati, you can read books, you can create dances, music for the amusement of human beings. But actually, the Saraswati puja is meant for people of ordinary awareness. But for enlightened people, it is the Mahasaraswati which is to be worshipped.

Thank you, Shri Mataji. Shri Mataji just beautifully told us everything that Leslie and Felicity have been talking about.

In that puja, I remember she said that Vishnumaya had come to awaken Shri Krishna, that he was sleeping in the land of North America, and she'd come to tell him to wake up, he has to act now. And Washington State... when Mother talks about Washington, from below Vancouver and Canada is Seattle in the state of Washington, so not Washington D.C., but the state of Washington on the coast.

Thank you for clarifying that. I was thinking Washington D.C.

I know, we should have said before. It was a big thing. It was reported in all the newspapers. I think Mother said sixteen hundred... and each lightning strike was recorded. And dry, no rain.

Then she goes on in the talk to say how she felt that we have to change the way we speak to the Americans, that we have to be fiery, that the sweetness doesn't work on them.

Wow. And so later in the puja... Leslie said she might have some other stories about being on stage, because the stage was very small. It was a small tent. There were only about forty yogis, and the children were very present. Mother had them sit up in the front, looking at the stage. If you watch how they come up to wash her feet, it's very sweet. They're very young. The girls, Fatima and Shreya and some other girls, had a big basket of flowers. Before Mother came out of the house, they walked in front of her and scattered these flowers to greet her onto the stage. So I felt maybe, Leslie, it was quite a small, intimate puja.

It was very intimate. What I remember is that Mother... when we were going to put the toe rings on her, she held them and distributed them to the ladies.

Oh actually no, it was the young girls. These young, thirteen, fourteen-year-old girls, there were seven of them that she had asked for. And they put the toe rings on Mother. That was also something very new for them, because they didn't know how to open it so it would fit on her toes. They couldn't close it because they didn't want to pinch her toe.

Oh, yes, this is nice to see a photograph. So this is in the pandal. This is the night before. You can see the flashes of the storm coming and how small the stage was.

One of the things about this puja was Mother was the director, completely. In many pujas, things are being done and she watches, and maybe she might make some change or suggestion, but mostly she was accepting our offerings. This one, she was very, very directive. At the point when it was time for the arati, she actually told me to get off the stage and go down and play the harmonium. She had me running.

This is a picture when the girls are there. You see the forest behind. It's such a lovely picture, Leslie.

And so what finger are you using? You're going in with your right Agnya finger. This is something that we don't often tell people, is that especially in those days, we always held the arm. Maybe it was a full offering because we were offering with both our hands. By the end of the painting of Mother's feet, we were using our entire hands to paint everywhere. We were completely red because you painted the underneath as well this time.

Yes, it was a full paint. And she would just put her feet up, off the ground, so you knew to paint underneath. She actually directed, she said, "Do it underneath. Paint underneath," very, very clearly.

As the puja went on and the ladies offered the oti—the coconut. The oti is when you are offering for fertility, basically. It's an offering of our desire to be fruitful, be prosperous, and spreading Sahaja Yoga and having children.

And what is in the plate?

So you have this beautiful mix. You have some rice, not cooked, just rice, and it has a little bit of Kumkum to make it auspicious and vibrated. You offer to the goddess a round fruit. You wouldn't offer a banana, really, or even citrus. A coconut is especially good. You just offer it into her pallu, into her sari. Normally in the puja we would put a towel.

That was another thing that I was busy doing. When it would seem to get very heavy, then I would pick it up quickly and take it off to the side so she wouldn't get burdened by it. Then the next one would offer.

So you start with the rice and the coconut, but then there are other fruits that are being offered into her lap. And then you would remove them because they were too heavy.

And then the offering would continue, because there were 14 ladies on that small stage.

In those days, Shri Mataji involved us all really a lot because the point was to clear people. Even just standing holding the sari up that's going to be offered, you just feel these vibrations washing over you, cleansing you.

The one thing I would like to say is that even in our pujas now, this is happening. As someone goes forward to offer the oti, or to offer the arati, as you come forward, you must have felt it. The vibrations change as you come up. Even if it's not on a stage, even if it's just on the floor and it's simple, when I've come forward here in Cabella, it is...

Would you say it's almost like Mother's opening her arms to you? You feel like you're being welcomed into the vibration and cleared out.

Definitely. It's like she's reaching out to you. You're coming forward with your offering, and she's reaching out to accept it with all her love and vibrations.

That's such amazing, beautiful photos that you shared, Felicity. Thank you, Leslie, for offering that puja. So we use the Agnya finger.

Yes, and we hold the other hand as a mark of respect. Anything that we give and we offer, we do it with one hand and the other hand, the whole being.

So we use the right hand, and the left hand is holding the right hand for the goddess to accept the offering. That is important. It's certainly something that we did always, especially for puja and auspicious occasions. If you were making a plate of prasad for Mother and you went to offer it to the altar, you would do that. It's something that I think has been forgotten a little in some places, but it's good to be reminded of that.

There was one point when I think it was you who had told Felicity that one sakshat puja with Shri Mataji was like four years of meditation.

Well, she said five years, I thought.

Please elaborate, both of you.

It was like, she said something like a puja in her presence was worth four years of meditation. The power of a puja in her presence was equivalent to you doing four years of meditation on your own—the power of the cleansing. But that was in the past, and I do feel now when you go to Cabella, you feel Mother's there.

You feel the depth. She's left the physical body, but even more powerfully...

Oh, much more. When we went to India to be in Shri Mataji's school in Dharamshala, we did a bit of a London tour. We stood outside the Brompton Square house that she had so lovingly curated. You can still feel vibrations so strongly, so beautiful. Birds singing, vibrations amazing, and London traffic and the maya going on around.

Do you want to talk a little bit about prasad or offering prasad? Do you have stories with that?

All I can say that I remember is that she loved very much the nuts. That seemed to be very, very important to her, to have that next to her. Right after the prasad was offered, it was a very important part, and it always went back with her to her room.

I wonder... because especially in the early years, when Shri Mataji sat somewhere with us, she would always have a bowl of chana, of chickpeas. She's talking, and she's eating it. She explained to us that she was eating the bhoots, that all the negative vibrations went into this chana, and she was eating it, like the story of Shiva drinking all the poison. So I wonder if there's a connection with the nuts.

We don't... in India traditionally, after the collective meeting, the prasad, besides any laddus and sweets, the traditional offering is these chanas and jaggery. So there is something more to it, perhaps.

I did have one time... it's not about the prasad, but one time, it was a puja in Connecticut, I think, that she called me afterwards and she asked me to make camphor. It was very interesting, and she told me how, because I had no idea. She said, "Just take that silver bowl that you're using over there and turn it upside down over the arati lamp. Just keep adding camphor, and then it will turn all black. As soon as it's all black, then take it around to all the yogis and ask them to put it on."

Like a kajal.

In a kajal, exactly.

Ah, so she was making kajal from camphor. Wow.

And it was amazing. Like, who knew? I didn't know that.

You could make it yourself. That's something that she definitely did recommend in those early years, that we all... because we would buy it on the India tour and use the kajal like an eyeliner. It had camphor in it, so it had this cleansing property to it. It would cleanse through your eyes.

It's just reminded me how every festival of Diwali, my mother would make the kajal herself with a diya, a lamp. And I foolishly enough, I thought I was being modern, I didn't like kajal then. So I missed out on a lot of clearing, probably.

I love it that you've said it a couple of times, that you were trying to be modern as a young girl.

In a way, it actually fits my life inside yoga. Because there were a good 20 years where I tried to be very, very Sahaj and Indian, in a way. And then for about 10 years, I wanted to be more modern. And now, I think I'd like to go back to being Sahaj.

Because we were so immersed in Sahaja Yoga, it filled every minute of your day. That's how Mother wanted it. We had to be like that in order to stay strong, to grow, and to clear out. We were her instruments, her conduits for the vibrations. We were also absorbing a lot into our chakras. We're like tape recorders recording all this stuff, and then you foot soak and you meditate and you clear it out. That cleanses it out of the atmosphere. There wasn't any space to do anything else because there were so few yogis. You just had to have all your attention there.

Do you want to just finish with the mask and the gifts?

Give me a moment. So Leslie, if you remember, we were sharing how after the puja... this was interesting to me because we'd had this sunset when people had talked about the prophecies of the First Nations. I knew that a mask had been specially made for Shri Mataji as a gift. It was made in Vancouver, and they had given a photograph of Mother's face to the First Nations artist, the woodworker. He had carved this very symbolic, special mask from her photograph.

And so it's the American Indians, right? Which, do you know the tribe by chance?

I can't remember. If you watch the third part, the black and white part of the video... somehow they ran out of videotape because suddenly it stops before they even get to arati in the colored version. Then you go down, and there's this black and white version. It's been edited. There's an hour more, but you've got a bit of washing Mother's feet, you've got the arati, and then you go into the gift giving. There's a collective gift given first, and then this mask is offered. When they offer the mask on the video, you'll hear them explain all the symbolism and the details.

This mask is crafted on the dimensions of Shri Mataji's face from her photograph. And when he saw the photograph, he was very... he recognized it. He said, "This is a very auspicious, a very special face." The dimensions, the measurements of Mother's face, are very special. And then they explain that this is a very powerful mask, made to express the power of the person it represents. It was something like there's a hole at the back and it fills up with the power, the spirit of the person whom the mask represents. And then they also said... and you can see Mother smiling, she was quite pleased with all of this... they said that you have to turn it horizontally like she's holding it, it has to be turned three or four times and then placed on the shelf facing outwards, and then the power will be released, will come out.

After this was offered, I was surprised to see so many of the leaders from around America, of the different states, come up with First Nations gifts. I'm pretty sure that Phil Trumbo brought something from the Hopi Nation.

I don't remember, but I'm sure...

You were probably busy at the back there.

Well, we were busy making lists of who brought what and where it came from and where it was going. Details, you know. That was a very important part of the gift giving, wasn't it? That everything was recorded.

Yes, you needed more lists. Lots of lists.

It was interesting how we felt Shri Mataji had her attention on the First Nations, not just in BC, but also through these gifts that were being offered as representation from the different tribes. I had been very aware when I'd come from London of how invisible... so I came in '82, and this puja was in 1990. I saw sometimes Native Indians on buses, and it seemed to me that they were almost not there. They seemed invisible. They weren't part of the culture. And I really felt in my heart that they were struggling. They were struggling on their reservations with alcohol addiction, drug addiction, all introduced by the white people. They were struggling to get their children through education so that they could actually help them.

After this puja, I felt something change. I felt a vibration, that the left Vishuddhi had lifted. I felt that the guilt of what had been done to them was partially lifted. I noticed in Vancouver after that, things started to change. I would see reports in the newspapers about schools that they had started in their language, how they finally managed to qualify people as lawyers so they had people who could fight for them. Suddenly, they were getting visibility in the newspapers, and we were hearing these good stories about how they were starting to be able to take care of their communities and help. I really felt this puja, Mother unlocked something. She opened something up.

It was interesting because she talked about Canada being the Hamsa chakra. I always noticed that when we would go down to the States for many years, the First Nations were still the invisible people down there. It felt like we were a bit ahead of the time in Canada. She had said at one point that things would work out in America through Canada, because of this, I think, being the Hamsa, the discrimination, the discretion. It was just a really... that's why I really wanted to have this opportunity to share with you, because you were there, and I felt on so many different levels that so many things worked out through this puja. We just cannot underestimate the power of the divine to work her blessings through these pujas.

It must have been special for you after this puja, because you were so directly involved, and then going back to L.A.

Every one of these beautiful occasions that we had, like when we went on the India tour or if we were in a beautiful, meditative, collective experience, my whole being was focused on trying to retain it, because I felt it was so easy to lose it. So I had a lot of desire and attention to keeping any part of those experiences with me. The vibrations just sort of seeped out of you. You'd absorb... Mother would lift you up, and you'd absorb all this, and then you'd go back to your own city, and they would just seep out. You couldn't fill it up in the same way. But it's so different now. It is so incredible because this is what Mother promised. She kept saying, "Keep going, keep going." She traveled so tirelessly. I think in this year, 1990, I looked... one of the years, she gave 200 recorded talks. Every city she'd go to, she'd do a public program, puja, and then there would be informal talks with the yogis. She would be traveling every few days. It was incredible.

But now we are in more of the blossom time. The world is going crazy out there, and the divine is working out huge, big things in the world. But vibrationally, as yogis, and even for people who aren't yogis, it is a different world if your attention is on the divine and if you want to grow and become that purer person. You can sit to meditate, and you feel your Kundalini come up.

You were juggling new families, being an established yogini, and traveling to be with Shri Mataji, doing so many roles. Is there anything that you think you could share for the younger yoginis here who are now getting into that phase of life where they're thinking of marriage or they're married and there are young families, and yet there are these other things to just go along with and take everything together?

Leslie, you were working full-time in America. That was a huge vibrational thing to take on, and living in an ashram with all the duties of cooking and sharing.

I don't know what I would suggest or say, but definitely your morning meditation is so practical, but it's so important. It sets up everything that happens to you the rest of the day. So without fail, to keep that very, very steady as you try to balance everything else. Because it is... what a time they're growing up in. The pressures are incredible at this point. What I can feel is that with all of our heart, we have to live the most unlimited life we can. With complete awareness of the divine as often as we can during the day, as much as we can. The realm of God is there for us if we take the moment to access it.

I think as a mom, having a busy family, what I learned was that it all changes. Suddenly, as a single person and then as a married person, you still have control over your life, over the day-to-day activities. You can set your routine to some extent. Suddenly, when you've got small children, it really throws you out. There are times when you get up in the morning and maybe you don't get that morning meditation. I remember having the twins, because we ended up with five children, not planned, but we had five children with twins. I can remember the struggle it was to find time to meditate. I always did, whether I had to sometimes put on the TV with a little children's program so I could soak my feet, or we soaked our feet together, or we went to the beach and they played and I could sit and meditate on the beach.

But I didn't have time for extra reading or maybe listening to much of Mother's talks or reflection. I remember this was bothering me. I felt like, "How am I going to grow?" I don't have any of this time to put into this. And then, after a few months, I can remember suddenly feeling like, "Oh, that's changed for me." Something had changed within me in a positive way, and I hadn't had to do anything about it. All I'd done was make sure I had my ten-minute meditation in the morning and hopefully a meditation at night. The growth had happened naturally.

Also, when I was teaching music, I had back-to-back classes. You finish one class, you have to set up for the next. Every day for quite some time, I'd come home and I'd think, "I forgot I was a Sahaja Yogi." This made me feel not very good. I'd say in the morning, "Now I'm going to work, I must try to remember I'm a Sahaja Yogi." And then one day, I went into the office to speak to the secretary, and she suddenly said to me, "Oh, I see you give meditation programs." I'd never actually talked about it in this school. I said to her, "Yes, yes I do. We have programs every week on Wednesday. You're most welcome." And then I said, "How did you know that?" She said, "Oh, one of your emails came through and it said about meditation programs at the bottom." I thought, "I have never, ever put that on an email." But somehow she knew.

When she was telling me this, what I felt was, "Look, even when you can't put your attention on it, your heart is there, and somehow it works through you." We don't always have to think about it because it's an organic process. I was in one program with Shri Mataji, I'd taken a friend to get realization, and all my attention was on him. I was feeling very much in the present moment, wanting him to get it. We went up to Shri Mataji, and she spoke to him. As we came away, someone said to me, "Felicity, you're so cool. There's so much vibrations coming from you." And I was completely unaware of it.

So sometimes, we can be deep in that moment and the vibrations are really flowing through us because our heart is open and Mother is working through us, and we're not aware of it. So I think that's important, to not beat ourselves up. We are doing the best we can, and your growth continues as long as you're part of the collective, you go to pujas, you try to be self-aware when you can. It's just going to happen for you. Someone asked her, one of the early yogis, "Oh, will this yogini be all right?" And Mother said, "If she sticks with it, she'll be fine."

It's really beautiful to have this conversation. I think while we'd like to carry on, we perhaps should conclude.

It's amazing how we started with your journey in the early '80s where there was no internet, no GPS, no mobile phones, only pay phones. And then we conclude with your story of an email which the divine sent to the school, which is perhaps in the later '90s.

Leslie and I were saying too, that how different it was living on the West Coast of North America when there were no emails, internet, anything. We were like the outposts. You felt like you were an outpost on the other side of the world, away from Europe where everything was happening. You just had to kind of muddle along and just keep on until Mother came. And thirteen times she came, she did the tour at least. So you were just so thirsty when Mother came. It was like, "Got to suck everything up while she's here." And Mother and all her love and compassion and graciousness. God, what a blissful life she has blessed us with.

And Felicity, it's your wedding anniversary today.

Yes, 43 years in a Sahaj marriage. Quite amazing.

Congratulations.

Thank you. Yes. My husband said to me, "A delicious supper tonight." In the morning, he said, "What are we going to have for dinner?" Because it's just the two of us at home at the moment. I said, "I'm thinking we'd have leftovers from last night." And then a little while later he came to say, "I'm going out to the shops," and he goes, "Let's have something delicious tonight." So I said, "Yes, you're right, we should." Anyway, it's funny.

So amazing. And what an incredible moment that you've joined us from Cabella, being an American, and Felicity from Devon, which is heaven. And so much time that we spent in Canada. How she just has pulled us all in a string of pearls, isn't it? Through time, through countries, through continents, and everything else. Yet, it's her love that brings us all together. So thank you first and foremost and forever. Thank you, Leslie, for joining us from Cabella. Thank you so much, Felicity.

Thank you.

And we conclude today's session. Thank you again and again. Much love.
