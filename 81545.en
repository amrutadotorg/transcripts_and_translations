So, tell us more about living at Chelsham Road. Was it the first ashram in the UK?

No, there were two or three before that. I didn't live in Chelsham Road; I just took the keys. We opened the door, walked around, and had a look. The previous tenant, quite an elderly lady in her 90s, was in there. She was in the room on the first floor at the back of the house, looking out over the garden. Her father had founded the Cow & Gate empire, which has been swallowed by a conglomerate now, but that was the big baby food empire. She was just waiting to be picked up and was quite alone, but we were there to ease her out of the house because she was obviously very attached. She said she'd been very happy there.

We spent a lot of time there. A lot of work needed to be done; the whole place was rebuilt by Mother two or three times. I remember being right in the basement, holding hands to take the foundation, and everyone walked in. There were a lot of pujas and weddings there. Gail and Graham were married there, and I think Hester and David were too. These were really lovely occasions, with canopies out in the back garden and fires. Everyone had a fire to walk on. There were maybe six, seven, or a dozen weddings at a time.

Before that, when we had the ashram in Dollis Hill, Mother would come there for a puja, and as Robert said, everyone took part. Everyone got a chance to actually wash Mother's feet and give the amrit as well. It was beautiful and very, very intense. Now, we have pujas, and it's a fantastic experience from start to finish, because hopefully—sorry, Mother—we've matured enough to be able to bear it. But back then, before the puja, all the negativity would come and have a go at you. "Why are you doing this?" It was as if someone were sitting on your shoulder, whispering, "Wow, this is ridiculous." You'd sit at the back or the front of the puja, and the negativity would still come up.

And then it went, because you got to put your head at Mother's feet as well. I can remember one time in Dollis Hill, Mother said, "Put your head on my feet." I put my head on her feet, my hands underneath. And it was like my head was about to explode. Really. She put a hand on my back. You could have been down there a second, an hour, a month. Eternity. It was an eternity. And then I thought, "Oh, thank you. I'm still alive. I haven't exploded." But the absolute intensity of the experience... that's the only way to describe it. Complete intensity.

And the vibration. Everything would vibrate. I was one with everyone—with Mother and with everyone. It was a smaller room than this, and there would be 50 or 60 people in there. Absolutely stomach-churning, like a sauna. Unbelievable. Once, when Mother was talking, she'd been sitting there for nine hours. Nine hours. In Dollis Hill. It was a three-bedroom, semi-suburban house, just around the corner from Dollis Hill tube station. We were there for quite a while, and that's where a lot of the TM people were worked on, the ones who ran about and jumped up. Pat described it, with the people walking past the garden wall, hearing people screaming.
