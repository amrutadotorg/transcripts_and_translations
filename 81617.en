I see. So, Auntie Jane met me at Vashi at the hospital, and she showed me a white sari with some print on it. It wasn't a very special sari, but she loved it so much. She said they all got saris when they came to India at the time. Because she was so tall, the sari was actually quite short for her, so she asked me to help her extend it. I actually got a fall attached on top of it so that she could wear that sari because it was just too short for her.

The interesting thing is, I started talking to her and she had apparently been a carpenter before that. She was working with wood. And so I said, "What was it like? What did Shri Mataji say to you when she found out that you work with wood?" She said Shri Mataji told her not to wear pants, but to wear a skirt when she was working. So I said, "And did you?" And she said, "Yes, I did." I asked, "Well, how did that work when you were carpentering around?" She actually showed me how she very demurely bent her legs and laid a plank of wood across her lap and sawed. She said it did make a difference. I found it really very touching. And the delight and reverence for that sari, which would actually look very ordinary, was so obvious. The idea of keeping it and preserving it and making it long enough for her... I felt kind of honored that she gave me this little job. It was nice. It was beautiful.

It's of course, it's the American for trousers. Yes, yes. I'm also tall, and I had to find out over the years that you couldn't just go and buy a sari. You had to make sure it was long enough. I think it's six meters, isn't it? Are there other two lengths, or maybe more than two, but six meters I think is what I need to get the pleats.

And also the width, you must need it wide.

Yes, I meant the width in this case. The fall is at the bottom of the sari to prevent it from getting worn and torn as you walk. But if you're extremely tall, you need to extend the width so that you have something to tuck in. So I actually attached the fall on top; I got it attached by a tailor.

Oh, at the top! How clever. Yes, of course. How clever. Good idea.

That was nice.

Caroline, I would like to tell a small story.

Yes, please do.

When Djamel Sassi came to Barcelona, he brought some saris for us, for the Spanish people. I was fairly new because I entered in 1992, but I settled more in '93. When he came to Barcelona, we flew from Madrid and were in a residence. When he arrived, he brought a big box full of saris. We were eating at that moment in the restaurant and they announced, "Oh, Djamel Sassi has brought some saris for you. So those that want some, they can come up."

I jumped up from my chair and I said, "Oh, I'm going, I'm going! I want to be the first to get one," because I didn't have any saris. And as I jumped, another man from Malaga in front of me said, "Oh no, you keep on eating. Don't rush. Because if the sari is for you, it will be for you. Have faith, have faith."

I sat down again and I was eating. And I said, "Yes, Shri Mataji is the Goddess. So the sari will be for me." When I finished, I went up, and the saris had run out. Everybody had gotten their saris. When I arrived there, I looked at the man who said, "Yeah, your sari will be there waiting for you." And I said, "Oh, gosh, I don't have any saris. I wanted one so much, and I was told to have faith and wait. I was patient, and now look what I got." Then one of the ladies, a Spanish lady, said, "Have this one because I already got one. So you can have this one." And she gave it to me. I wore that sari many times.

That's beautiful. For me, it was a tremendous lesson.

Then also, once I went for Her birthday—I don't remember the year—I bought a special sari. I didn't understand about the silk. The sellers said, "Oh, silk is silk." The person who was with me said, "I know about patterns because I design, and it's a very beautiful design. But I don't know much about if it is pure silk or not." In fact, I wore it for the birthday and it turned out not to be pure silk. It was a mixture with polyester or something. It's very beautiful, but I was really, really disappointed.

Afterwards, I was a little bit ill, and they were going to a factory where they sell saris with old patterns. And I said, "I want a blue one with a silver pattern." So I gave them the money to bring it to me. When they arrived, the sari was... how do you call it? Violet. Not violet. Morado. Oh, gosh. Not purple. Purple! That's right. It was purple. And whenever I wear my purple sari, I always say, "Oh, this is my blue sari." But there you are. It's nice to have a purple sari with silver lettering. So at long last, I have a very beautiful, expensive, proper sari. But I have to add more cloth to it because I'm very tall and fat, so it will fit me.

Does anyone else have any stories that they want to share while we're still recording?

I've got a couple of things that have sprung to mind, but I don't know how much time we have left.

Oh, plenty. Thank you so much, Gauri and Roz. I really enjoyed the stories, and they're both very different. And Roz, when you mentioned the Punjabi you bought, I'm sure it was very beautiful, but it just sprung to mind that once I was wearing a Punjabi in front of Mother, and Mother said something like, "Yes, yes, very nice, but all the vibrations will fall off it straight away." So when we wear a sari, and we're in the strong vibrations of a puja—because a sari represents the Kundalini, of course, as it goes around—it holds the vibrations and keeps them for a very long time. But she said if you wear a Punjabi, it just all falls off straight away.

Someone did tell me that. Don't worry, it was the lady that brought me to Sahaja Yoga. She did tell me that, and I've always remembered that in puja, the pleats of the sari hold all the beautiful vibrations. That sprung to mind.

Wow, I didn't know that. That's so important to know. So important.

And once, when I was quite young, I was wearing a Punjabi, and I didn't have the dupatta for modesty. She was very insistent to wear the dupatta to cover yourself. It's just all this very motherly attention to detail. So many memories about, oh gosh, comical things as well. Like Mandakini mentioned about the very tall yogini in the sari which wasn't wide enough.

I don't remember where we were, but Shri Mataji had been getting ready for puja in her own hotel room. And of course, Shri Mataji could get ready boom, boom, boom. I'm sure people have seen her put a sari on in two seconds flat, on and perfect, never falls off. And I said something like, "even without a full-length mirror," because I don't know about you guys, but sometimes you need to see if it's showing ankle—it doesn't look very elegant. I'd said something like, "Oh, it helps sometimes with a full-length mirror." And she sort of smiled.

Then we were somewhere, and she was in the car, and we were looking out the window, and there was a yogini showing about this much ankle. And Shri Mataji looked at me and she goes, "I don't think she has a full-length mirror." It was just this sort of quick humor that she would come out with, very, very funny.

Carol, are you recording this?

Yes, yes, we're still recording.

No, I mean, it's just so many things. Whenever she was getting ready for puja, she was always paying particular attention to the color of the sari, the pattern. Particularly one puja, I believe it was the Sahasrara Puja in Vienna, that very strong puja that Gauri will remember, no doubt. She was wearing a puja sari she chose specifically which had golden squares.

Oh, yes. Saraswati Puja.

Yeah, you remember that one. She said, "This represents the Maryadas of Shri Ganesha in these squares."

I think I remember that. I actually remember her saying that.

I don't know if she mentioned it in the puja itself. I remember her choosing it and mentioning it, but she may have mentioned it.

Yeah, I remember hearing that, though.

Yes, because you were there. Definitely. So there was always great attention to detail. There was no such thing as a casual choice. How she would choose colors and designs was obviously for a very deep reason. And the gifts that she would give always had a meaning, of course.

I remember one of the first saris I got. I'd gone to her home and I was wearing this jacket I’d bought in Camden Lock Market. It was pretty trendy those days to go down to Camden Lock and buy a genuine Chanel jacket for 50p or something. I was maybe a bit embarrassed wearing this secondhand thing because I thought, "Oh, it's secondhand, I shouldn't wear it in front of Mother." So I went in the house with the jacket and then took it off. Later she came from her room and she brought me a sari in the exact color of that jacket. She said, "Oh, that pink really suits you." It was so sweet how you think she doesn't see anything, but she sort of saw out of the corner of her eye and came with this pink color.

Years and years later in Ganapatipule, when she bought the wedding saris for the grooms to choose for their brides, she chose them and they would come and buy them. Enzo had chosen a purple one for me, I think, a lovely sari, purple with zari. He bought it with one of those wads of rupees that Roz humorously described. We were all going around with these wads of rupees, weren't we? He’d taken the sari and then later on she saw him and she said, "Oh, don't worry, I've chosen Danielle's wedding sari." And she fished out this pink one, the exact same color from that day when I was about 16 or something that she'd given me. So he had to buy two. Of course, he couldn't say, "Oh, I've already got one, Mother." So he coughed up another wad of rupees. So I got pink that day, pink, the color of love.

I have to stop there because there are so many.

I'm glad I'm not the only one then that was going around India with this huge amount of money in my bag.

It’s so funny. And all those cotton ones, Glenda, Gauri, that we got. Some of us, I have to admit, when we got our colors, we weren't so gracious. I remember if you really hated—shouldn't use the word hate, it's too strong—but if you were, let's say, my mum wasn't fond of the color orange. And, of course, the first sari Mother gave her was orange.

The orange one, yes. The first sari I got from my husband was an orange one, and I had an aversion to orange as well. And she said orange is the color of detachment. So that's good. How interesting. Anyway, that feels like a pound to start, five to stop. It's interesting because telling even some of those stories, some of them are not in the memories book I've just put in. Telling the stories brings it all up. So it's lovely.

Yes, when somebody else says something, you remember exactly how it was, don't you?

Absolutely. Like that sari that Shri Mataji described, I remember that now that you mentioned it—the sari she wore for Saraswati Puja, 1985.

Caroline, there is one little story. I don't know if I'm interrupting, Danielle?

I said I'll stop there otherwise...

Okay. Again, an India tour. Unfortunately, I can't remember the girl's name, but there was an Australian. I was in my early 30s, and she was probably about the same. She married an Indian chap on that tour, but she was a real character. I've never been able to remember her name. I've got photographs of myself with her. And we were given that pile of cotton saris, as you already mentioned. Some of them were lovely. I saved a pink one and another one for years and years because they were so lovely and cool in India.

Anyway, we got these piles of saris and they were all very similar; many of us got the same ones. But this girl—I think she may have come later to the tour—she got her pile of saris, and there were ducks on one of them. Little ducks on this sari. And we just went, "Oh, how sweet. Trust you to get that," because she was such a personality, a strong character.

Did you say ducks? Like quack quack?

Yeah, quack quack ducks. All over the sari, like a line of them around her sari. And everybody asked her the same question: "Did you go and buy that sari?" She said, "No, no. It was in the pile that Shri Mataji gave me." Oh, that's Shri Mataji's little play with you, because she was a real character. She would never think before she spoke; she just said things. We were all laughing, but this sari really suited her personality. We never saw another one like that, actually. With ducks on.

That's just taken me back, Rosalind, to getting my pile of saris on the India tour. It's just amazing. We were so lucky.

Also, she gave us the towels, these striped blue and white striped towels, which we still have one of. With the sewing machine, I've sewn it together again and again and again, and now it's just like a saving piece. We used them for years and years. She said to us, "These towels are such good quality." Bringing them back from India because Mother handed them to us... Just amazing.

Yeah, Chris has only just stopped using his, I think.

I've just remembered a funny one about the towels, if I may. On the first India tour I went on, we were told, "Don't bring towels. You only bring one dress because you're going to get saris." We had to keep empty suitcases for bringing things for Indian yogis and for Shri Mataji. So, I didn't bring a towel, only had one dress.

The things that we were given to bring were also random. In my suitcase, amongst other things, I had tins of Frankfurter sausages and custard. I thought, "Oh, this must be a specialty for the Indian yogis that they can't get, or maybe for Mother's family." I had been carting around these tins of Frankfurter sausages and custard for quite a good while. And no towel manifested for a good two weeks, and the saris were delayed. So I was using a petticoat as a towel. It's so funny, Danielle. It's such a lesson in detachment. You just did what you were told.

But the best thing was when we got to Pune or Nashik or somewhere, I can't remember, but I thought, "Ah, finally!" We were asked to deliver the goods: the Frankfurters and tins of custard. And you know what we had to eat that night? What we were served. So, obviously, we were probably all moaning about spicy food or something, and there you go. They weren't for the family or for the Indians. They were served up to us.

I tell you, once we get talking about India tours, I would love to sit for about a week with all the yogis and talk about the stories. When you look back now, at the time, they all seemed quite serious when we were young yogis in the beginning years. But now you look back, they are hilarious, aren't they? Just jokes.

We were always bringing Kraft cheese in cans and things like that. I remember being told to bring polyester material for the Indians. They loved it.

Because the Aussies used to bring baked beans, biscuits. It was great. We were so frugal in England, very austere and quite fanatic, I think. It was an absolute revelation for me when I went on my first India tour and I met you and Cheryl and all these wonderful, open-hearted, normal, joyful, funny people. I think you took pity on me because I was like a kid, a skinny 16-year-old, and you shared all your biscuits and baked beans. It was great. We had a lovely, lovely time.

Magic, wasn't it? Absolute magic.

The greatest one I had, a great revelation for me, was when a whole bunch of Australians came on one of those early tours, possibly the first or maybe the second one I went on. 1991. We had so much fun with the Australians. I think the English and Australians do have a kind of rapport somewhere along the line. Absolutely. The things we got up to, honestly.

Great. That was the year that Danielle and I got married, in fact, 1991.

Yes. To our respective husbands, obviously.

That's right. Yes, we did.

You got married in the same year, did you? Wow.

That would be one of my stories, the marriage. 1984 is when I got married. Forty years this year.

Yeah, so brilliant. We'll be hearing that in February then, Gauri.

Yes, marriage stories.

Okay, ladies. Well, I think it's time to slowly draw this to a close. It's been a wonderful evening as ever. So, for the second time, I'm going to stop the recording now.
