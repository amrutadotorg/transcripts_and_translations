Interviewer: Hi. So Thomas, I'm really happy to welcome you this evening to tell us a few of your stories from your time in Sahaja Yoga. When did you join? What year did you get your realization?

Thomas: '79. But just let me briefly say something about this video we saw just now. It's really worth spreading because I think it's not so well known how Shri Mataji showed this exercise. I just want to say, I use it sometimes briefly, just lowering the head like this, breathing in, putting the attention on Sahasrara, and then breathing out when this light comes into Sahasrara. It's really a nice way to be easily thoughtless.

Anyway, it was '78, actually, that I met one Mr. Rustam Borje, who is known for being one of the prominent yogis at that time. He was an Indian from a well-off family who studied psychiatry, and he was a doctor of psychiatry in London. Somehow, he had contact with a German psychologist in my study place, which is Freiburg im Breisgau, near Basel and the Swiss and French borders. So he got the chance from this lady to use her practice to earn some money. I don't know what the reason was, but he took some patients from her. As I studied social work, it was quite normal that people would do some kind of psychological treatment.

One of my best friends at that time, he went to this lady and met Mr. Rustam Borje. When he came back the next day to our university, he told me about this incident and that Rustam told him about Sahaja Yoga. He tried to give realization to him, which he did not feel as such, but he told me about it. And especially, he said that this TM business, which I practiced for some years, that this TM is very bad. I was just on the cusp of leaving it because I felt like I was in a glass house, and fortunately, I didn't go into the deeper areas of this so-called transcendental meditation. So, it struck me that he said this is a very negative thing, and I made an appointment with Rustam Borje.

When I came, and he opened the door, I felt a tremendous power in his personality. I would not say I felt vibrations, but it was some authority I felt from him, also because he was a person who emitted this authority. He tried to work on me, but I did not feel cool, and I did not have an extremely strong experience. It was more hot, I remember. He gave me some lemons in the end and worked on me with them. He said I should dump them in the next river, which I did. He also told me I could meditate in the church in Freiburg, which has a beautiful Madonna that gives vibrations. I did so. He also gave me the little black and white picture of Shri Mataji.

Time passed. In the next year, Gregoire had visited Rustam in my town, and I met Gregoire also. So everything came into place. Then, the next year, Rustam phoned me and said, "You can come to England to meet Shri Mataji."

Well, I did so. I booked a flight. At the time, there were very cheap flights. I was a student. When I came, I slept on the lawn outside of the airport because the plane arrived rather late. The next day, I went to Dollis Hill, which was in northwest London. A typical attached row house, which was one of the first ashrams in London at that time. When I arrived, there was hardly anybody there, but somebody told me Shri Mataji was not here. I don't know how I could not have checked that before, but it was just a fact. They said she was apparently in the north of England. Nobody knew where or what.

As I always wanted to go to Scotland, I hitchhiked there with my army sleeping bag. I ended up in this so-called Loch—a lake in Scotland, they call it a Loch. It's a small little lake in the highlands, north of Edinburgh, with a youth hostel. I felt very pleasant, I must say. I remember trying to paint something of the landscape, walking around. The next day, I took a little highland train back to Edinburgh, and the next stop was Loch Rannoch. And Loch Rannoch, which I found out two years later, was exactly the place where Shri Mataji was holding a seminar in the hotel. It was the hotel where Peter and Linda Pearce, who were somehow heads of the New Age movement in Scotland, had held seminars. Shri Mataji somehow wanted to work out this place.

It really struck me that in this huge highland, I was on a train stopping at that station, about a kilometer from Shri Mataji, without knowing. It is just one of these miracles.

Interviewer: Sorry, Thomas, that was while Shri Mataji was there, at exactly the same time?

Thomas: Yes, of course. That's when she did the seminar with some yogis. That was what people in London meant when they said she's in the north of England.

Interviewer: Wow.

Thomas: So, it was just amazing if I look back. I came back without my mission accomplished and went back to Germany. That was the summer. I was about 25 or so.

In the winter, in December, I flew again. Rustam had told me there would be a Guru Puja, which I didn't know what it was, but I went. I came to Dollis Hill, and preparations were going on for this famous Guru Puja where Shri Mataji declared, "I am the one who came to save humanity. I am the Adi Shakti, the power of God." The whole speech is so amazing, where she actually declared herself for the first time. I was present for that without having had my realization from her. I went through the whole puja, everything. I got the book, The Advent, also in the end from Gregoire, which had arrived in those days. Shri Mataji gave a signature.

At the end of the whole thing, I was sitting with three others in a row before Shri Mataji and was introduced as a new seeker. She was working on some man next to me, and I was closing my eyes, waiting. At one moment, Shri Mataji said, "So, open your eyes. How are you?" Then she said, "Close your eyes." And suddenly, there was this movement inside me to my heart. All the pain of life, the tragedy... I mean, I didn't have a tragic life, but as many seekers, we went through some issues. It was just coming out. Maybe it was the joy of the spirit to feel that complete relief, but it was like pouring out of me.

Then, in one moment, she said, "Now it's coming up now. Come, laugh it out." In that moment, it was like a rocket. A huge universe opening. It was just so amazing, beautiful. And I had to laugh, really. This thoughtlessness and this state lingered on for the next days. Even in the ashram in the night, I woke up and was completely bathed in bliss.

After the whole ceremony, Shri Mataji was leaving, and the English people were singing Christmas carols, which was so beautiful. Later in my life, I always sang these English carols with my children. She said, "Oh, they're a bit left-sided because Jesus was in the cradle." But she liked them quite a lot, especially "Away in a Manger."

When she walked out of the room, Gregoire was beside me and said, "Bow down to her. You will not have the chance so often." I didn't know one could do it, actually. So I was bowing down on the earth, and Shri Mataji passed by, stopped, and said, "Get up. How are you now?" I said, "Oh, I'm fine, but it's not like before." Then she asked me, "Did you have a guru?" I said, "Yeah, this TM stuff I did, but not for so long." And she said, "Yeah, it's very bad. You should say, 'Mother, you're my guru.'" So I put my hands out and I said it, and then, woof, again it was raising tremendously.

This was a start which was just so amazing. Coming home to my studies and friends and trying to talk about it was, as usual, like talking about the taste of a mango to somebody who never had one. It's just impossible to describe, and also the frustration, I must say. So this was my start.

At this point in the interview, Thomas shares some photographs.

Thomas: I don't know exactly which program the ones from the program were. I think it may have been in Zurich, but the one right below is in Bonn. Bonn was my hometown where I went to school. Gregoire had sent me a letter, I think in '81, that Shri Mataji was doing a tour from Geneva, Lausanne, Zurich, Bern, and Basel in Switzerland. "Why don't you organize something in Freiburg?" So I organized the first programs in Germany in Freiburg, exactly in the university where I was, the Audimax. The second was in Bonn.

After this first program in Freiburg, we drove together by train to Bonn. As it was, we arrived in Bonn and walked by foot towards the inner town, which is a very close walk. This was like a full dive into my past because first we passed the big toy shop of one of my classmates' father. She went in there. Then we went on, and she must have asked if we could eat. I said we can go to Kaufhof. Kaufhof is one of these big department stores where my father was actually the head of the restaurants all over the place. It was a department store in all the big cities of Germany, so I was used to going to this place where my father worked. It was a special moment, of course, that we went to this restaurant. And as you can see in this photo, Shri Mataji had an ice cream after the main course. It was also a moment where this personal rapport was so relaxed.

In this department store, she also bought a toy train for her grandson, I think. The program was organized by an old friend of mine because I was not there, and actually the hotel also. The hotel was a disaster because it was so simple. I didn't know anything about the prestige and the worldly situation of Shri Mataji as a diplomat's wife and all this. And I didn't have the money as a student to invest. Actually, I feel very shameful. After the program, we wanted to eat something and there was a Wienerwald downstairs. A Wienerwald was a chain for chicken, like Kentucky Fried Chicken. We brought the chicken up to her room in the aluminum foil paper, we opened it, and we all ate chicken. It was just one of these stories which many of you may know, going to McDonald's or whatever.

On top of that, there was no soap in the bathroom, and she mentioned that. One year later, I went into her room in Lausanne, Switzerland. I had bought soap for her. I went into the room and she said, "Yeah, come in." I said, "Shri Mataji, I'm sorry for this hotel, and I bought soap for you." She took out from her purse this green Chandrika soap, which you might know, an Indian Ayurvedic soap. She let me smell that, and I remember it was an opening of the Vishuddhi. It was such a feeling. She said, "Good smells open the Vishuddhi." I just know after that, it's very difficult for me to smell artificial smells. I cannot bear it. But on the other side, good smells really open the Vishuddhi.

So that was the story of the first meeting in Germany. You also saw on the upper picture the farewell photo at the airport in Düsseldorf, with me in my leather jacket and Shri Mataji's big smile. I remember I felt I was in heaven. It was just amazing to bid farewell to her. It was a very special moment, and she gave so much love.

These first experiences kept me going. Many of us know that we go through hills and valleys. Sometimes there are valleys in life, but then you remember those deep moments and you keep on going because you know it was real. It was so real, more real than anything else. And I kept going for the last 44 years or so. It's still that I feel there's something to grow. And I feel it's beautiful, especially when I'm here in Cabella now. There's nothing better than deep meditation. That's why whoever listens to my humble words, I can only say, keep going, keep going and always seek the deepest moment. Don't give up and somehow keep up the intensity of our search. This is so important.

Interviewer: Certainly one of the things that helps us to keep going in our Sahaj journey are the miracles. I'd like to ask you what miracles mean to you? Should I start by showing the picture then of Shri Mataji as Hanumana?

Thomas: Yes, please. This is something amazing. Actually, I can say that I was not very fond of miracle photos. I took a lot of photos in the past, so I knew how photos can trick you. So many vibrations, like flickering lights, can be easily done by long exposures, as we know. But Shri Mataji still used them, and it's not up to me to judge that. I was always a doubting Thomas in the sense that I stick only to what I really feel and know and see.

In Schwetzingen, near Frankfurt, in an old castle, we had this Hanuman Puja, which was so beautiful. An amazing talk, which you must know, talking about the whole Ramayana. Before the Puja, Ian Paradine and I went to the market to buy some flowers and fruit for the Puja. So I said, why don't we take herbs with us? Because there's this story that Hanuman was flying to rescue the brother of Rama, who was near death. There was only this one sanjivani grass which was growing in some mountains, and Hanuman brought the whole mountain because he could not make out this grass. So we bought a lot of herbs and made a big bush. At the end of the Puja, Ian and I brought this bush in front of her. She was very enthusiastic, took the whole bush, smelled each one of them, and on the mic, commented on what it is for and how good it is, and also how it is used in Ayurveda. It was a beautiful moment for me.

Before that, there was this picture which you just showed. I was sitting on the side of the stage, and I had my little camera and took this picture. Actually, I did not see what I did in that moment, or what my camera did, or what Shri Mataji did, let's say. When the picture came out—because at that time there were only analog films—I was just... what? It was amazing because you can see Hanuman's face in her so clearly that it's just stunning.

When I came to Cabella next time, there was a meeting and I showed it to Shri Mataji and the others. It was going around, and they were all so amazed by this photo. Actually, I lost the negative and I made a photo from a photo, but this was my personal miracle. It was a teaching that doubting may be okay, but then you get your own miracle. Just like this doubting Thomas, who had to put his finger in Christ's wound when He appeared after His death before the disciples. He was asked to put his fingers in to prove that it's really Christ. Maybe I was a doubting Thomas.

Interviewer: Sorry, what year was that puja again, Thomas?

Thomas: About the 90s, early 90s. There are not many Hanuman Pujas. It's called Hanuman Puja in Schwetzingen, Germany. You can easily find it.

Interviewer: Next on my list is the picture of Rahuri.

Thomas: Yes, Rahuri. That was the first Indian tour I went on, '84-'85. This has a special history and a special significance for me. This Rahuri was a farm of Mr. Dhumal. Dhumal had given realization to 10,000 people; he was a fantastic man. Unfortunately, he died very early. He was a sugarcane farmer, and we went to this farm. As you can see, it's a very rural area. Shri Mataji was wearing this simple cotton sari, and we were sitting in rows before her with our banana leaves on the ground, eating.

I was sitting a little bit behind and I saw her sitting there. I was just amazed by her beauty and the whole setting. I went with my little camera, very shy, and with a gesture, I asked if I could make a photo. I made this photo, and she gave me that smile, which is so much personal because she gave it to me, in a way. But for me, it also expresses a big amount of compassion. It's not only a smile. It's saying, "Don't worry. Be happy. Don't have a left Vishuddhi. Everything will be okay."

Later on, it's funny... can you see on top of Shri Mataji's head, there are three lines? Actually, they are the colors of the house, a tree, and the frame of the door. Sometimes I was wondering... you have the dark, which is the left side, the middle golden color, and the red color is supposed to be the right side. And I was wondering, does Shri Mataji at all have a right side? Is everything on the left side, on the Ida Nadi? Everything is in her desire. As she's Shakti, she desires and then it's carried out automatically. Can it be that she doesn't have any right side? It was just a theory which once came to me when I saw the picture.

But the story isn't ending. I gave away the negative somehow, and when you give away the negative, that's it. You lost the photo. Some years later, Ian suddenly gave me a present of exactly this picture in a frame. I said, "What? From where do you have this?" And he said, "Oh, it's from London. It's very popular in England." I was just flabbergasted, because I lost it, and it was coming back to me. This is a picture from a picture, so the quality is not so very good. But this was the picture which is so much a miracle to me.

Interviewer: So, the next picture was Krishna Puja.

Thomas: Ah, you see Rajiv Gandhi. That was the election of Rajiv Gandhi, and posters were all around. If you look at my face, you would see an amazing similarity. The children in the street, or people, were giggling, "Rajiv, Rajiv!"

There was the Puja before in Nasik, in the house of Dr. Sangwe. I think you might find it if you search for the video, Krishna Puja '84-'85. In this puja, Shri Mataji was talking for the first time about Vishwa Nirmala Dharma. She said, "Oh, people ask me, 'Is it a religion?' Yes, of course, it's the religion. The pure, universal religion. And to make it short, we can call it Vishwa Nirmala Dharma. So, according to that, you will be called Nirmalites, like Christians, according to Christ, are called Christians. You will be Nirmalites." Big applause and laughing, and such an easygoing atmosphere.

Especially because in that talk, as marriages were on the way during the tour, some people were already quite tense about it. She made up this story about husband and wife and the differences. I think it was in that puja when she said, "You know, men, they don't know anything, but you have to know how to handle the man. Let's say, the man wants to plant a coconut tree, and you know that the climate and the garden is not made for this. So, you don't object. You don't confront the man with your opinion, because you know better. What you do is, you plant the mango tree. And when the mangoes come out, the man will say, 'Look, the coconut is getting mangoes!'" She was saying it in a very funny way. It was so hilarious and so beautiful, talking about the differences of men and women.

I think one day in Cabella, we should collect all her talks about men and women, because it's so meaningful and another aspect in modern life which is missing today.

Interviewer: There was such a collection. I got married in 1990, and I was given the marriage book... it had all these talks in there, and how to handle the husbands.

Thomas: Yes, exactly. How to handle the husbands.

At the end of that Krishna Puja, Shri Mataji was asking people to fix their eyes on her bindi without flickering, and concentrating on her bindi like that. I was sitting 20 meters straight towards Shri Mataji, and I did it. She was really answering that look. Sometimes we all feel Shri Mataji looked at us during the puja, but this was just... she was just staring at me, like I was staring at her bindi. Then I went into a state which was celestial, not from this world. It was so intense, I could not bear it anymore after some seconds, and I closed my eyes. But it was so beautiful.

When we got out, that's when I come back to the picture of Rajiv Gandhi. I had this tilak, and was dressed as you could see. I was putting myself very seriously next to the poster. Though, inside, I was not serious at all. I was just in a beautiful state after the puja. I did it deliberately, I stood there like a statue next to it. And then immediately, children came, "Rajiv, Rajiv!" It was a big fun. This is a special moment where the depth was so intense, and the fun and the joy were parallel to that. It's not a contradiction.

If people see these reports from us yogis from the past who saw so many incidents of Shri Mataji talking personally, I really want new people also to know that Shri Mataji had both sides. She has this very much down-to-earth side, and the complete diving into the deepest moments was always her aim, that she makes us worthy to be presented to the Almighty.

Interviewer: Thomas, can you tell us the story of the chandelier in Prague?

Thomas: Ah, yes, Prague. Prague was near to Munich, so we all went to the public program Shri Mataji gave there. During these two days, some of us went with Shri Mataji to a dinner or lunch in one of these huge restaurants. We were sitting with twelve of us, six on one side, six on the other, and Shri Mataji at the head of the table. It was really feeling like the Last Supper.

In one moment, Shri Mataji put her attention on a chandelier which was hanging down in the staircase area. There were mirrors on both sides of this chandelier, reflecting it into infinity. You know, if you go into a lift with mirrors inside, you can see yourself reflected in infinity. Like this. Then she said, "You know, this is how the creation took place. It was Shiva and Shakti on both sides, and they put Ganesha in between and mirrored him in infinity. So the whole creation is like the infinite mirror of Ganesha."

She was sitting like this at the end of the table, putting her arm on the table, doing like this. We all closed our eyes. She closed her eyes, and we all closed our eyes. It was, again, one of these magic moments. Complete thoughtlessness. We felt the absolute truth in what she said. This is always when she spoke this eternal truth, that you just go into thoughtlessness and there's no way of analyzing it. You just dive into the truth of it. That was one of these moments.

Interviewer: You mentioned a shawl, when we were talking before. Is there some special significance to you?

Thomas: Yes. I wanted to tell you a very short moment in my life which seems so irrelevant, but for my emotions, for my left side, it was a big thing. We had gone to the Rigi, which is a hill station in Switzerland. It was completely foggy, you couldn't see your hands on the way up. But when Shri Mataji arrived at the top of the hill, pure sun. Then she said we were going to have a havan. We prepared a fire. She asked us to get some leaves to decorate the fireplace, but there was just grass in this area. There was a bush on a slope which was going really deep down, but it was just one meter away from the edge. I just reached out to get these leaves, and she was very close by, maybe three meters or so, and she said, "Take care, Thomas."

It was... she took my name. She was caring. It was such a relief for my heart. Sometimes, you don't feel you are up to the mark. But with this, she opened the whole cosmos of my heart. It was just a little story.

But the shawl... that was when we had a puja here in Cabella. The first pujas were on the bridge, and there were fires on iron plates, directly on the wood. Shri Mataji would sit at the upper entrance of the castle. Some ladies were there cooking, preparing biryani maybe. I was going back and forth, and then the pots were brought to her to put something inside, like herbs or spices. She was chewing something, maybe cardamom, which had to be opened by her teeth. She took it and put it inside. She said, "I hope you don't mind if I put it," but of course nobody minds.

I was sitting on the stone bench at the entrance of the castle, just beside her, and she was putting these things inside the pots and staring. I was in complete admiration of the situation, of this fire and Shri Mataji. I said, "Shri Mataji, it's just like a puja." She said, "Yes, of course, it's just a way how you look at it." This, again, is something so simple, but so important. It shows Sahaja Yoga is not Hinduism. It's about the authentic feeling of your heart, what you put inside.

At one of the pujas, I had built a pizza oven down at the lower part of the kitchen in the castle. After the puja, I was sitting with Herman, an architect from Austria, before her. The two of us. She wanted to discuss something about the staircase in the reception room. We both did not get it from the plans we had before us, how she could see that. Then suddenly, she said, "Ah, Thomas, you did this pizza oven. I should give you something." Then, a moment later, she had herself covered with a shawl. Her body is not so big, and the shawl covered her mostly. I was looking at her and said, "It's so beautiful, looks so beautiful on you." She said, "Oh, you can have it." I said, "I didn't want to say that!" And she took it off her and threw it on me, two meters away. So I had no chance but to accept it. This holy piece I keep with me, of course. That was a big blessing, but also showing her easy way to make people happy, and to learn from her not only the generosity, but to see the need that another person has, the need for love, and when to give it and how to give it.

At this point, Thomas shares photos of Ganesha forms found in nature around Cabella.

Thomas: These are really miraculous, and I still cannot believe it sometimes. This was just in upper Cabella. As you can see very clearly, there is a big elephant with an eye, and a small one behind. It's just a root coming off before a piece of a stone wall.

Interviewer: I'm just looking now, again, at this, and really the eye, especially the eye of the smaller elephant, it's just full of compassion, it seems to me.

Thomas: Yes. So, before one puja about four years ago, I had a footsoak just before the puja and I looked in the river. Before me was a stone that looked like a heart shape. I took the stone and turned it around, and I was shocked. Can it be more clear? I put little dots with oil where the eyes are, and the trunk on the left side was there anyway, but I made it a little more clear with some water to show it better.

Interviewer: It is amazing. I thought it must have been a sculpture or something. I didn't realize it was just a stone you'd found.

Thomas: It's just a stone. I keep it at home on my altar. We all should be more innocent, maybe, like children. I didn't look for all these; it just happened. This is the most miraculous thing. I don't go around with a camera to look, "Oh, do I find something like this?"

Interviewer: I don't think I have any more questions for you. Is there anything else you'd like to share?

Thomas: Thank you, Thomas, it's amazing. When you listen to these stories, you feel like all the deities are sitting here with us, and you feel like Mother's here also.

Thomas: Yes, I hope I can convey a little bit of the feelings I had, and that it shows people who come after us, who come after those who met Shri Mataji in person, that they can imagine a little bit of the atmosphere and the moments that we shared with her.

You know, Shri Mataji was an expert in so many things. One time, I wanted to write something about how much she was a specialist, be it in architecture, be it in psychology, be it in relations between husband and wife, be it in politics. It's just amazing. Everything came from the intuition and the inspiration. I have the feeling we should copy that. I have the feeling we can be very much in this world, but not be from this world, like it is said in the Bible. We should be informed, as she said, you should read the news and know about everything in the world, but at the same time be very detached. Go to this watchful state of witnessing, and from that, change the world.

Interviewer: Certainly, Shri Mataji can only work through us when we're detached, when we're in a witness state.

Thomas: That's very true. I once had a vision of what one could make a piece of art out of. When she went away from us, I had this idea she is going around the world like a layer of a special aura, and she's everywhere. Whenever somebody goes into the witness state deeply, then this power of her flows in like a funnel. I was imagining a funnel, and this blessing pouring in, the knowledge pouring into yourself. It would be nice to make a picture like that once: a yogi sitting there, and you see Shri Mataji's power flowing into him when he's going into this deep state of meditation.

Interviewer: I shall remember that image now, Thomas, when I'm meditating.

Thomas: Okay, that's it. Thank you so much for having me.

Interviewer: My Sahasrara is beautifully open, so thank you very much for that.

Thomas: I thank you so much. If this is the result, I'm very, very happy. Thank you so much.

Interviewer: I'm just going to stop the recording.
