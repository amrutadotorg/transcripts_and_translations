London (England)
Okay, thank you for joining us all the way from the United States of America. We are here in England at quite a pleasant time, but yeah, it's getting decidedly autumnal here.

Shall we start with you, Mark? Please tell us where it was you got your realization.

Yeah, so it was September 14th, 1992. I remember that day quite clearly because I marked it in my appointment book; I didn't want to miss the experience. But I'd been seeking my whole life. My father was a Christian minister, and at 12 years old, I had to go through this confirmation thing. I decided I didn't want to do it, which was kind of a big deal when you're the son of a minister, right? But it wasn't rebellious; I just didn't want to do something I didn't feel comfortable doing.

At that point, I started saying, "Well, if I'm not a Christian, what am I?" I didn't want to just believe something; I wanted to experience it. I started reading these secret books about yoga masters of the Far East. I took philosophy in college. I took a Hatha Yoga class in my 20s. But I also kind of swung the pendulum the other way. I was in this sort of partying lifestyle—seeking and partying, back and forth like this. Then in my 30s, I got tired of the whole partying thing and just didn't want any more of it.

I had come to the conclusion that I needed to get my realization and learn to meditate. Of all the readings and things I'd done, I prayed to the Divine to give me a guru that would give me my Self-Realization and teach me to meditate. The very next day on the internet, there was this article posted on Seattle.general. This was before the World Wide Web; they had Usenet groups. So I went on Seattle.general and I saw a posting that said, "Shri Mataji's coming to Seattle to give Self-Realization and teach people how to meditate"—the very thing I prayed for the night before.

Wow, nice. So it was kind of like one of the first miracles, if you will.

She came and she gave a fairly long talk. It was at least an hour or so before we did the Self-Realization. I remember being very anxious, like, "Are we going to get realization here, really?" So, as we're going through the experience, we're told to put our hand above our head. And she says, "You might be feeling like heat and cool coming off the top of your head." That's exactly what I was feeling. Afterwards, I felt different somehow. I immediately stopped drinking, and I felt something different inside of me. I changed. I knew that the friends I had weren't really... I just saw them in a different light, and gradually over a few months, I sort of lost contact with these people that were a negative influence on my life.

So anyway, I kept meditating. Back in those days, they would give you this photo of Shri Mataji and say, "Place a candle before it on a table." And yeah, I felt this was a little bit peculiar, them saying, "Oh, Shri Mataji's photo has vibrations" and this and that. But she said in the meeting to try this as an experiment, and if it works out, you should accept it. Okay, deal. I'll give it a try.

Twice a day, every day for two weeks, I felt absolutely nothing. So I called the local center. They were very anxious; I was the only one that called back from the program. So they started working on me, giving me the foot soak... nothing. By this time, five weeks had passed since I had my realization. I was about ready to just give up. And one night, my Kundalini just came up so strong. It was like coiling at the top of my head. I got totally blissed out, went thoughtless, and I was like, "Oh my goodness, everything I read about in books was happening to me." And from that point on, there was sort of no turning back.

This story kind of begins and ends with Shri Mataji, but between those times when I saw Shri Mataji again, so many incredible things happened. I had like three miracle cures. One was from the vibrations from her photograph. I woke up one morning with this really, really bad sore throat, like I could hardly swallow. They were just starting to teach the mantras, so I was saying the mantras for the first time, and I felt this cool breeze. It just completely went away, in an instant.

Then there was another time where I smashed my thumb with a hammer, like, really hard, doing something stupid. Totally excruciating pain. I put some ice on it, thinking, "Okay, I'm going to have to go to the emergency room for sure. I'm sure something's broken." Then I raised my Kundalini with my attention while I was icing it. After about a half hour, 45 minutes, no pain. None whatsoever. I put a band-aid on, went up, and finished building the doghouse that I was working on. That night I pressed on it through the bandage—nothing, no pain whatsoever after smashing it as hard as I could with a hammer. Some of the yogis later told me it was probably just a clear out, because my left Swadistan and left Vishuddhi were my nemesis in the beginning.

And I had a third one where I suffered miserably from hay fever allergies. I used paper burning and shoe beating. I had tried shoe beating kind of sort of before, but I was like, "This is too weird for me." But this time I was so tired of suffering from the allergies. I just... I was just pounding with everything I had. I burned the paper and I beat the ashes. I'm not saying this is how you should do it, but there was so much desire. That's when I realized it's the desire that really gives the treatment its power. And when I put my hands on the earth, I had never felt Mother Earth like that before. I felt like I was sitting on top of a nuclear weapon or something. I could feel this power, but this calm and this peace came up, and my allergies disappeared completely.

So even though I wasn't in Shri Mataji's direct presence, I really felt her attention and her working on me. The candle flames, there'd be like explosions, like a firecracker. I was a wreck when I came. So even though she wasn't there directly, these things were happening.

So I went to my first puja in Cabela. This was kind of another little miracle thing. They had given some gifts to Shri Mataji when she came to Seattle, and she said, "Oh, the next person that comes to Cabela can bring them." So that turned out to be me. I went there for Shri Krishna puja, my first puja with Shri Mataji. There were kind of awkward things to carry. There was a big picture of the world from outer space, and I had to wrap it in cardboard and duct tape. Then there was another sandalwood box; I put it in another box and duct-taped it.

I get to the airport and they said, "Oh, we're going to have to charge you extra for your sleeping bag and your duffel bag. But I can put those in a box too, if you like, and then you'll pay one." I said, "Okay." So I had three cardboard boxes. I arrived in Milano in 1993. There was all this domestic terrorism going on, and they had these military guys with AK-47s and steel tables. They're opening people's luggage and just throwing things around. I'm like, "Oh my God, I got these three boxes."

But they told me, "Wear a badge of Shri Mataji on your shirt or your jacket when you leave." So I clipped on a badge. I felt a little self-conscious. I went out there, and there were these two customs guys with their automatic weapons looking at me. They say, "What's in this box?" And I go, "It's a wood box." I could see the guy was looking at my eyes, looking at the photo, and then he'd look at the box. He looked at my eyes, looked at the photo, looked at the box. The guy kept repeating the question. The other guy says, "Well, what's in the other boxes?" And I said, "Oh, there's a picture." And then the guy says, "Okay, go on."

I'm pushing my cart with my three boxes past all these metal tables, and they're just throwing people's stuff in the air. This little thing, Shri Mataji actually had a name for it when they sort of get mesmerized. They're gifts for the Adi Shakti, right?

I thought, "How am I going to carry this?" They said, "You have to take a bus to the train station and a train. Then you have to take another bus to Cabela." I can't even carry these three things. So I'm just wheeling my cart out, and all of a sudden I see this guy holding up a Sahaja Yoga sign. I go, "No way." Nobody knew I was coming. The guy says, "Oh, are you the American?" I go, "Yeah, but I didn't tell anybody. How did you know?" I said, "Oh, it must be somebody else you're here for." He says, "No, no, come with me, come with me."

So we pack up my three boxes on the car rack of this little teeny Renault. Then we pick up his wife and his son in a car seat. And he says, "Oh, we have to pick up another Yogini also." So the five of us are in this tiny Renault, and everything's stacked up on top of the car. I look out the window and the tires are compressed about this close to the rim of the wheel as we cruise down, singing bhajans, to Cabela. It was really quite extraordinary.

I didn't meet Shri Mataji again at that time, but I was at the puja. That's when she introduced "Vishwa Vandita," because she had actually written it for me and it was introduced. I remember—I don't think she'll mind—Raina from Toronto sang it, and she was beautiful.

Anyway, I come back. I didn't get to meet her directly other than in the puja. And the vibrations were incredible. I felt like every cell in my body had been scrubbed clean. Then I come back and she was coming to Vancouver, Canada, which she would do almost every year. So I drove up. I really wanted to thank Shri Mataji. I'd had all these amazing experiences since my Self-Realization, and I really, really wanted to be able to thank her for this. They said, "Well, maybe if you go offer a flower, you can thank her."

So when I offered a rose to Shri Mataji, I said, "Thank you so much for my Self-Realization. I didn't realize the significance completely when I got it." And she just looked up at me and she says, "Be sure and tell the world about it."

Wow. So I said, "Yes, Shri Mataji. Jai Shri Mataji." I don't know if this is part of that promise or not, but I did document a lot of these because there are other miracle experiences I'd had. I have like 20 pages of all these things that I'm trying to figure out how to get out there.

This is the promise you made to Shri Mataji. Shri Mataji asked you to share your experience with the world.

Yes, it is. Jai Shri Mataji, again and again. This was at the airport in Vancouver in 1993, about a month after the Krishna Puja. I was only a year in Sahaja Yoga.

Some of the most amazing experiences that I had, I was not in her direct presence. But I was absolutely in her attention, for sure, or these things wouldn't happen. And these things can happen to you also, even though Shri Mataji is not here in her physical form. You can have these incredible experiences as a Sahaja Yogi.

Patricia, I'm curious to know how your seeking journey started and how did you come to know about Shri Mataji?

Yeah. I was very fortunate because my mother has always been a seeker. She always used to tell us, "It's more than a house and studies. There's something else more in life." It's not only this material being. She used to tell us, "We have everything, but no, it's not that." I used to look for it also. I studied as a lawyer, I studied a lot of philosophy. I loved the philosophy, the studies of Socrates and those things. And I was always thinking about how I could make myself happier. That was my seeking. How can I make myself happy? I wasn't feeling so happy, really, and I was very uncomfortable, especially as a teenager.

I finished my studies, and my mommy had started Sahaja Yoga one year before. In that time, there were only like seven yogis, maximum. Sahaja Yoga was just starting in Colombia. She used to bring the people to our home. Our home was big and in a very nice area, so they used to come to our home and do the artis and things. My mommy put pictures all over the house. My father was a journalist; he was so skeptical about everything, but I never felt uncomfortable.

One day, I got into a little kind of depression because I broke up with my boyfriend of a long time. I was thinking I was going to marry him, but I realized that he wasn't serious. So I got in a little depression and my mommy used to say, "Okay, let's do the footsoak." So she would put the picture, I'd do the footsoak, and I'd fall asleep. The next day I'd be so happy. I'd say, "This is kind of weird. How can I sit down, do a footsoak, raise my energy, and after I can go and sleep in peace?"

So one day she said to me, "Why don't you come with me? We are going to a puja." I only knew a little bit. She said, "Come to the puja." I said, "Okay, I'll come to a puja." I didn't know so much; I only heard the songs and all this stuff. We came to the house of a Yogini that was from Switzerland. She was kind of the first person who came to Colombia to start Sahaja Yoga. I saw these people, kind of hippies, you know, very relaxed. For me, it was like they were hippies, but okay.

But she said one word to me. She said, "Ask for detachment," because I was so attached to this person. She said, "When you put your hands on the feet of Mother, you ask for detachment." So I did. I put my hands on the feet of Mother and I asked for detachment. And I tell you, immediately, automatically, I felt... in that moment, I think I got my realization, strongly. Before, I would get relaxed with my mommy and I realized there was something special, but in that moment, when I put my hands on Shri Mataji's feet—in that time, you washed the feet with your hands—I asked, and I really felt so free. So detached.

The next day, I met the guy, because he was a friend of my sisters and everything. I got there and I talked with him like nothing, like he was just any person on the street. I said to myself, "I can't believe I feel this freedom inside me." And that was kind of the beginning. From that, I didn't let it go. I said, "This is something special. I have to see what is going on here."

Shri Mataji came to Colombia and did a program. My mommy said, "We have to go, all the family." My father didn't come, but all of us—we were four—she invited us to be with her. It was amazing. This was 1989 or 1990, I don't remember exactly.

In that moment, I started really falling in love with Sahaja Yoga. In one talk, Shri Mataji said, "The only way to grow is to live in a collective, in an ashram." At the end of 1990, a lady from Switzerland came because Shri Mataji sent her to Colombia. My mother said, "Oh come on, we have to pick up this lady. She's coming to do Sahaja Yoga." And I said, "How? She's coming from Switzerland to live here in Colombia in a little ashram?" It was a very poor kind of thing, and I was so intrigued. I said, "This is incredible."

I saw her coming down and I saw so many vibrations. For the first time, I could start feeling the vibrations of people, and I said, "Oh my God, this person is special." It was so special for me to see that people would surrender so much—move from Switzerland to Colombia, leave their children in India, and come here. The children were probably at the school. For something special. So from there, I decided to live in the ashram with her.

I came to live in the ashram because the first ashram there was so beautiful, full of young people. Yes, young people laughing all day, enjoying life so much. I never enjoyed my life like that time. For me, it was very special, because we just enjoyed and enjoyed and enjoyed. Our routine, being such a young collective, would be either college or working, and then public programs and collective meditations. The leader, Marilo, was super active, so we traveled all over the country. We would work during the week and jump on a bus all night, 10 hours, going to another city to do programs in Medellín or Cali, and then come back. We were a group of maybe seven of us, and we took turns. We lived for three years on the road to open other cities.

Then in 1992, Shri Mataji came, and that was an amazing story. We had to fix the house where we were living, moving from that house because we had to receive Shri Mataji in a better location. We decided to move the whole ashram to another, bigger home. We decided to do a lot of things because she said she was going to stay for seven days, and in that time in Colombia, that was a lot. We decided to do a seminar and a puja for the new people, because they had only been in Sahaja Yoga for two years, or one year and a half, or maybe even six months.

We decided to do it in a place called Paipa. It's about two hours from Bogotá, in a very beautiful hotel. We could fit all of us; we were 70 people, with people from other countries also. Yogis came from the U.S., Switzerland, Mexico—a lot of people. We also had to go to Medellín. It was a very difficult and dangerous city because at that time, with the narco-traffic, they were putting bombs in every corner of the city. Sir C.P. told her not to go, but she said, "I'm going."

So first, she came to Bogotá. We had the convention center, and it was like 2,000 people showed up. Wow. We had a little advertisement in a newspaper and put posters all over the city, and the people came. Shri Mataji was very pleased, very happy. We were so happy with her.

The next day, we went to Medellín. We only had three yogis in Medellín. We didn't have time to go there and put up flyers or posters or do things. Shri Mataji said, "No worries, everything is going to be okay." So we went to the airport, giving flowers to Shri Mataji. Many people saw us put our hands together, how we bowed to her, how we treated her like... and one journalist came and said, "Who is this?" I said, "Oh, she is an amazing spiritual human being that is almost a goddess." He said, "I want to know her." I said, "You can give a flower to her."

Shri Mataji started talking with him. "Who are you?" He said, "I am a journalist and I want to interview you." She said, "Come with me." So he jumped in the car with Shri Mataji. We went to the hotel and sat down in the reception area of her room. He started asking her questions and recording. He said, "Who are you? Where are you coming from?" At one point, we all sat down, a group of yogis, in front of Shri Mataji. He asked, "What do you think about Jesus Christ?" She said, "Well, the best yogi in the world, Jesus Christ, who came to help us to forgive. And I'm going to show you. Put your hands like this, all of you, and say the Lord's Prayer in Spanish."

We said it slowly, slowly. She said, "Say it very slowly, so you will feel the vibrations of Jesus Christ." We put our hands up like this and we said the Lord's Prayer very slowly. You can't believe what we felt. We felt completely connected to her, completely in awe. No thoughts. It was like the moment stopped. The present was so full in that moment. It was so real, that forgiveness and love of Jesus Christ, that the guy said, "Oh, I get it. I can't believe it. This is incredible." He said, "I'm going to show this to the whole city. I'm going to the radio to express... Please, allow me to do the introduction in the hall." And she said, "Of course, you can do the introduction."

The guy left, completely realized. He went to the radio and he blasted it the whole afternoon. The room was full of people. We couldn't fit them all in the room. He did an amazing introduction. We lost the video, but it was the best introduction that any yogi could do. Shri Mataji was talking through him. We were stunned at how he talked about her. None of us could have done it the way he did it.

After, Shri Mataji invited him to India, and he went to India. He was a yogi. But he came back a week after. His wife called him and said, "What are you doing there?" Anyway, the most amazing thing was that the city was so on fire, you know? The time was so difficult. And after she came, everything was peace.

Mark and Patricia, what happens next in your journey?

Well, we got married. We're both retired now, but we're both doing things for Sahaja Yoga. Patricia, in particular, is still involved in all these realization tours in Central and South America and the Caribbean islands. I volunteer with the 21 Days program, and I'm on the council here in Florida. We'd like to get something established where we live. We live kind of in between the three centers here in Florida—Orlando to the north, Tampa to the west, and Fort Lauderdale to the south. We'd really like to do that and just support it as best we can.

We just completed an eight-month, eight-country world tour, mostly visiting yogis and going to international pujas. We visited six ashrams in India. And I have to say that being in a relaxed mode—because now every day is Sunday for us, so we don't have work taking up our time—I really felt like the level of my meditation and the level of my vibrations were elevated during this time. So far, it has continued to be at that level. I want to share that. We're both feeling more relaxed, we have time, and we just want to do what we can to share this incredible gift that we've been given.

Tell us the story of your marriage.

Neither one of us was going to go to Cabela in '97 for the first marriages there. I got this long voicemail from a yogi named Linda saying, "Oh Mark, you should go to Cabela. They're going to have marriages this year." I was going to go to India and maybe see about getting on the marriage list there. She was saying, "No, no, there might not even be marriages in India. Shri Mataji wants all the yogis to go to Shri Krishna puja."

I didn't have a lot of money; I'd been recently divorced. I said, "If I can use frequent flyer miles, I'll go." So I called up United Airlines. This was July, calling for travel in August to Italy. The odds are like almost nothing, right? Well, they had one seat going and one seat coming back in the month of August. The seat going over was a week before the puja, and the return was two days after. If I could have picked the days, those would have been it, because I always like to go early to help out.

When I got there, a person who had been traveling with Shri Mataji said, "Oh, you know, you've been matched with a Ukrainian." I go, "What? A Ukrainian?" So on Wednesday, I'm going through this maya, thinking, "I don't speak Russian. What am I going to tell my kids?" All these mayas. Then, they say, "Mark, there's five Ukrainians that need a ride to their flat." So I go there, and they're all in their mid-to-late 30s, dressed to the nines. And I'm thinking, "Am I matched to one of these ladies?" I'm stumbling over my tongue, my feet, really awkward.

I went back—I was sleeping in the pandal at that time up by the castle—and I said, "Shri Mataji, I trust you. Whoever you want me to marry, I'll marry." And finally, I just surrendered it. No more mayas. I knew everything she had done for me was for my benevolence.

So, when they made the announcements on Friday, the announcement was not to a Ukrainian. It was, "Gloria Patricia Costa Mendez from Colombia."

She picked the absolute perfect person for me.

In 1994, Shri Mataji came and told me that she was going to find a very, very strong man for me. She even pulled my ear. After she came out of the room, she told me, "I'm going to find a very, very strong man for you." And I was like, scared to get married. I said, "No, I'm not going to put my name in." So I passed the years and I didn't put my name in. All the yogis said, "Put your name, put your name!" "No, no, no, I'm not going to do that again." I was very scared to get married, really.

One day, Marilo, the leader, was in Switzerland, and they all took vibrations to see if I was okay to get married. They felt it was very cool, so they called me and said they had just made the application for me, even signed it. And I said, "What is going on? Please, Marilo, no, no, no." She said, "Yes, it's decided, Patricia. You come to Cabela and you get married. I know because the vibrations, they are so clear."

So I went to the office the next day. I had just come back from a tour in Brazil and used all my vacation. I didn't have money, I didn't have vacation, I didn't have a penny. I went for lunch with one of the CEOs and I told her the story. "Look, some person in Italy wants to get married with me." I told her that, and she stopped for a second, looked at me, and said, "You have to go. I know you have to go." She wrote a check for $2,000 and gave it to me.

I came back to my office and said, "This is crazy, this is insane." I went to my boss and told him the same story. He said, "Oh, you have to go," and gave me a week and a half off. So I had the time, I had the money. I went to the ashram and said, "Okay, buy the ticket."

There was another maya. At the last minute, they told me that there was no match for me. They had made a mistake. When they were preparing the matches, Shri Mataji said, "Something is wrong here." They started reading and discovered what was going on. So they changed it at the last minute. This is why they changed him from the Ukrainian to me. Everything was like a maya in that time. The leader told me that Shri Mataji was making these matches from South America and North America to work out the connection between the two.

In 2000, Shri Mataji came to America. We were planning to go to the puja in Seattle. Before we left, I had a dream, a very vivid dream, that I was going to interview Shri Mataji. In the dream, Shri Mataji said, "You have to dress normal. You cannot put a sari, you cannot put a Punjabi. It's not Indian. You have to dress as a normal person, like an executive. You can have a dress and buy nice shoes."

I got up in the morning and I told Mark, "I had a dream. I'm going to buy shoes and I'm going to buy a dress because I'm going to interview Shri Mataji." I felt crazy about it, but I said, "That was the dream. I'm going to fulfill it." So I went and bought the dress, I bought shoes, I packed, and I left for the puja.

At the puja, Mark and I decided to ask for a baby. We had been trying for so long, and things weren't looking so good. At the end of the puja, we can ask for a boon, and it just came into my attention. I said, "Please, could you bless us with a baby?"

In that moment, one of the yoginis who was helping with the Washington D.C. public program invited me. She said, "Come with me, because we need people to speak Spanish. We want to invite all the ambassadors to come to the program we are going to do in the Lincoln Memorial." They put a stage for her, and she was going to do a public program there. I said, "Oh my God, how special, in the middle of the most important place in the country."

So we went there. Shri Mataji sent a word: "I want somebody to do an interview with her in Washington D.C." We started putting a package together and going to all the TV stations in English first. No one said yes. Then suddenly, we started with the Spanish ones, and the Spanish ones also said no. At the last one we visited, we started talking with the guy and he was already saying no. I said to him, "Look, if Jesus Christ came today—because he was a Latino, I had to use Jesus Christ—if Jesus Christ came today, are you going to say no to him? You are going to close the door? No. You open and you give the opportunity to them to know him. It's the same thing that happened with Shri Mataji. You have to give the opportunity to know her, to know her powers."

He was like, "What is going on here?" He said, "I don't have a journalist. I have the camera, I have the microphones, I can send all the equipment, but I don't have a journalist for tomorrow." And I said, "I can do it." It was the moment of the truth. The whole dream came together. We sent a note to Shri Mataji asking if she wanted to do this interview at a Latino TV station, and she said yes.

That was the most amazing, most funny interview you ever saw on the planet. When we came in, Shri Mataji organized the room. She put the book Meta Modern Era on one side of her, and she put me here, and she wrote every question I was to ask her. So I had to memorize the questions. And she said, "Put your shoes on." We were without shoes in her presence. She said, "Put your shoes." So the new dress, new shoes, all came together. No Indian clothes.

The most amazing thing about that interview is that every time she passed the microphone, the vibrations in me were growing and growing. I was more thoughtless and more peaceful. After the interview, Shri Mataji told the camera crew and everyone there—about 12 people, all Latinos from different countries—to sit down on the floor. She gave the realization to all of them. Then she started talking about each country. She said, "Bolivians, they have a lot of love. They have the love of South America." She said, "The Colombians, they are the energy." She made a connection between us in America and in South America.

At the end, I asked Shri Mataji for a boon again. It was silent, and in my silence, I said, "I know you move mountains. I know you are the only one who can give me a baby. I send to you this immense desire I have, but it's up to you." And in that moment, she touched my left knee and squished it, like a massage. I knew that was my weak part. She massaged very deeply. I felt great at that moment, like I was clean, like a pure, immaculate cleaning. Very clear. And after one week, I got pregnant. After five years.

This was in 2001, just weeks before 9/11. I had already made arrangements to go to India for the Ganapati Puja seminar. There was a New Year's Puja in Kalwe, and I was with a friend from Canada. We decided we would give a gift from Canada and America. Hardly anybody was traveling internationally at that time. Alan had picked out a silver plate and two silver chalices.

So we go up after the puja to present the gift to Shri Mataji. Nobody's really saying anything. So I said, "Shri Mataji, may these chalices soothe your Vishuddhi for all the hard work you've done for America." And she looked right at me and said, "I saved America, you know." Thank you. Somebody from America needed to acknowledge this. It was definitely the right words to say at the time. We don't realize how important these gifts are and the symbology, how much she's working on a subtle level to work out all these problems in the world.

In 1999, I went to Canajoharie a week before the puja. There was nothing but land and 14 holes in the ground. I'm like, "We're going to make a pandal, a kitchen, drill for water, run electricity... in a week?" I was a bit cynical. But when the Adi Shakti wants something to happen, it's going to happen.

One day, Thursday, I was responsible for the electrical. I went to one of the vans that had all the parts. "Where's the van?" "Oh, somebody went to go pick up some people in New York." A four-hour drive away. We weren't going to see that van the rest of the day. I took another van to get the last bits and pieces, and nothing was going right. I didn't meditate because I was too busy. I didn't use Sahaja Yoga once the whole day. I come back, slam the door of the car, and realize I'd locked the keys in. A bunch of Yuvas come up. "Uncle, uncle, can we help?" I'm like, "Whatever."

I go off, still in my mental mode, calling a locksmith on my cell phone. Barely 60 seconds go by and I hear this, "Jai Shri Mataji! Jai Shri Mataji!" They go, "Uncle, uncle, the door's open!" Two Yuvas went like this to raise the lock up on the door. I felt about this tall. I hadn't used Sahaja Yoga the whole day.

The next morning, somebody is shaking me. "Mark, Mark, you got to get up and hurry with the electrical. Shri Mataji is coming tonight." And I go, "No, I'm going to go meditate." I went in; the stage was mostly done. I closed my eyes, I meditated, and I said, "Shri Mataji, you're the only one that can make this happen. I'm not the doer, you are definitely the doer." I hear somebody moving around me. I opened my eyes. Some sweet Lakshmi brought my plate of food for breakfast. I'm eating my breakfast, and the guy that was supposed to help find people for me comes up out of nowhere. "Uncle, uncle, I have our electrical crew." All I did was meditate and surrender to Shri Mataji.

We were straining conduits and wires all over the place. I looked, and there were maybe 100, 150 yogis decorating, finishing the stage, doing all these little tasks. I could feel like we were in a time warp, that time was just being stretched out to finish all these things because there was no way there was enough time.

Finally, it's starting to get dark. We get everything wired up. We turn on one set of lights, and they come on. We go to switch on the other set of lights, and the circuit breaker trips. We were going to have to undo one light at a time to find out where the short was. When we undid the second one, no tripping. So the short had to be in the second light. I look at the second light—it was shining on the video screen. It would have washed out the video screen. It wasn't supposed to be on. Down to the level of detail.

So we left that light off. And finally, we're done. I go walking out towards my tent to go shower and get ready, and I hear the conch blowing. Shri Mataji's arrival. All the things we did—this huge pandal, the stage, the electrical, the kitchen, cooking food for an international puja with over 1,500 people there—and the moment we finished, Shri Mataji's car comes up and the conches are blowing her arrival. She was staying over an hour away, but she knew exactly when to leave and exactly when everything would be ready. And that's when I realized it took those Yuva Shakti using Sahaja Yoga to show me, "Use Sahaja Yoga, stupid!"

There was a dream, Patricia, that was very different, wasn't it?

Yes, in Canajoharie, when we didn't have the house for Shri Mataji, we had to rent a little B&B in a small town. These houses were from the 1900s and we had to fix them up. We got there a week before, and the leader said to us, the Latinos, "Please fix the house of Shri Mataji because it's Krishna puja coming and we don't have anything there." So they brought fabrics from Colombia, pictures from other places, and we came to the rented house and fixed it beautifully. In one week, we made the curtains, the cushions, everything with the same fabric—even the tablecloth, the bed, everything for Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji came, and of course, she saw all these colors matching everywhere. She asked, "Who did this fabric?" And she said, "I want the same fabric in Cabela." The lady who was supposed to do the garland and welcome her wasn't there; her children were sick. So she told me and Marilo to welcome Shri Mataji. We did the arti, we took out Shri Mataji's socks, and put the kumkum on her feet.

After that, we were four Colombians, two from Brazil, and one from Argentina—all Latinos. We sat down there, and Shri Mataji started asking about Colombia. "How is Colombia doing? How is the narco-traffic?" We were telling her it was still a little bit shaking, still a lot of problems there. And Shri Mataji said, "You have to ask for forgiveness."

So we all put our hands open, and Shri Mataji said, "Ask for forgiveness for all the Colombians, for all the aggressiveness." My mother felt, more than all of us, like lightning passing through our whole body, like something was burning. Like Vishnu Maya was clearing out all this negativity of Colombia in us. We felt like we were getting red and burning inside. I asked another person, "How do I look?" They said, "You are red, like you're going to explode."

She kept saying, "You have to ask for forgiveness." It was so strong. After that, Shri Mataji married five Colombian ladies at that puja. And after that in Colombia, they had to start doing programs everywhere—in the military, everywhere. That year was a boom. Shri Mataji put her hand in every place in Bogotá. They did thousands of programs: children, schools, universities, the government. It was an amazing year of Sahaja Yoga in Colombia.
