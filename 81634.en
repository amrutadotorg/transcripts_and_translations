Okay. Hi, everybody. Jai Shri Mataji. It's a pleasure to be here. Thanks for inviting me. You probably should ask me a question because I don't know exactly what particular specific thing you guys wanted to talk about. I think it had something to do with Canajoharie, but if you want to ask me a question, it'd probably be best.

I don't have any specific question to ask you, Steve. I thought you had a particular story that you wanted to share. Joe, do you have maybe a question for Steve?

Steve, can you tell us your experience when you went up to Canajoharie for the first time with Michael?

Yeah, that would be great. That's what I thought; I thought it was about Canajoharie. That's good.

Well, I was in New York. I'd lived in New York in the '90s. In 1994-95, Shri Mataji had moved us there. She bought a house in Yonkers, and about six Yogi families lived in the house. So I had a relationship with New York. I was living there during that time, and then I was coming back and forth and staying for extended periods in later years.

I don't remember the exact date. If anybody remembers when Shri Mataji purchased Canajoharie, that'd be great. But I do remember being the errand boy in Shri Mataji's suite on 57th Street. I think they rented an apartment for Shri Mataji for three or four months, quite a long time, above 57th Street, a really nice place. The errand boy consisted of going out and running around New York City, getting things, prescriptions, or anything that was needed from Duane Reade. It's a place in New York, like a pharmacy that has everything. Another place we have now is called CVS. But the idea is that it's one of those you-can-buy-everything stores, and there are a lot of them in New York City.

I remember a few things. We were looking in the newspaper for land, and they were looking at the realty classifieds. There was a moment where they went through some things and turned the page or went on to the next column, but they had passed by what was then to become Canajoharie. And Shri Mataji said, "No, wait, wait, go back." They didn't know where to go. She said, "No, back that way and then down this way," kind of directing the person who had the paper. And then they said, "Here?" She said, "Yes, look there."

And then, of course, they read out what was to become the land deal for Canajoharie. It was, I forget how many acres for what price, but it was a very good price. Everybody was very excited at that point because, like a needle in a haystack, Shri Mataji had pinpointed a place to go to find out about and to ultimately buy.

Soon after—and again, I don't remember the exact days and dates and how much time transpired between all these things—I do remember being in the same apartment. And this would have been after our trip up to Canajoharie. I do remember Shri Mataji signing. This was only a few of us there: Gagan, the accountant, myself, and maybe one other person. I remember the document, the deed or whatever it is that Shri Mataji signed to purchase Canajoharie. I was in such close proximity that I had this feeling I was watching history unfold. As if you were in the room when the Declaration of Independence was being signed or some great document was being signed, I had this feeling that I was in the presence of a historical moment. I was extra attentive to every move of Shri Mataji's hand because as she signed it, it was a moment of great importance. I was very grateful to be there.

Then, as far as the reconnaissance trip up to Canajoharie, we were all scheduled to leave the next day. There were to be two cars: one with myself and Michael Fuseli, who now lives up near Albany, and the other car was Shri Mataji's car. I believe maybe Harsh was driving it; I don't remember exactly who was in the car. So I remember sleeping over at Michael's. I think he lived up in the Bronx. I remember a night full of anticipation, looking forward to the next day, and having some brotherly moments in Sahaj, which was fun.

And then there we went. We had a kind of a convoy with Mother's car, Shri Mataji's car, and Michael's small Chevy or whatever it was. At one point before we got to the land, we stopped at McDonald's. Honestly, it could have been before, it could have been after, but I do remember going to McDonald's and having a burger and Pepsi or Coke, and Shri Mataji joking around about the Coca-Cola and that kind of thing.

When we went to the actual land, it happened that Michael and I were just a little bit ahead of Shri Mataji's car. We spontaneously got out of the car, and it was just this little round patch where you could park. The rest was just knee-high or maybe hip-high green grass. If you've been to Canajoharie, you know there's this sense of all green, very green and a very soothing grass that grows. And of course, it probably hadn't been cut in a long time. So we just spontaneously started running into this grass. If you can imagine a couple of bear cubs or something, we started tackling each other and rolling around in the grass. We were just screaming for joy, just having to be youthful. I think we were both maybe in our late twenties, and it was just a spontaneous expression of joyous innocence and fun and brotherly love as we just rolled around in the grass. I believe, I guess technically, we were probably the first two yogis to go on the land, but not that that means too much other than the fact that there was this beautiful moment of joy that I think we were able to have. And that would be a forerunner of so much joy later that is happening now.

So, we got back to the patch of land, and Shri Mataji's car arrived. She got out of the car, but she didn't stay too long, really. She looked around and said something like, "It's beautiful, isn't it?" She looked at us and acknowledged, obviously, that we were in a good state of happiness and joy.

And really, we left after that. It wasn't a long visit. Shri Mataji didn't sit down, we didn't have a picnic, we didn't walk around too much. I think the whole idea was just for Shri Mataji to see the land and vibrate it. She obviously knew what the significance was. She knew all about the land. And it probably would have been right after that that she went ahead and signed the document in that moment that I mentioned, that I call the moment of witnessing history in the making.

So that's really the story. It was that initial finding of Canajoharie in the newspaper, which was one of those miracle moments where people are spinning the pages and missing it, and then Shri Mataji directed them back. She knew where it was. Then there was the trip up to Canajoharie and that incredible feeling of exuberance that we felt immediately when we went on the land. And then, of course, the signing of the document itself that was, as if there were slow motion. You know how slow motion is. It's just... maybe it was the way that Shri Mataji signs her name, but it went as if it were in elongated, stretched-out time. I can remember it as if I'm seeing it right now in my mind's eye.

That's the story. I'm interested to hear what Michael might say, what his experience was. He might be able to fill in a few gaps in terms of the date, because he drove and he may have a few more details. So, it's good to talk with him about it as well. Thanks.

Thanks so much, Steve. I'll pause the recording a minute.

Excellent. So thanks, Mark. If you can share your memories, that would be brilliant.

Greetings, everyone. My name is Mark Mays, originally from Seattle. Steve had just recounted his memories from when the land was first purchased. I'm not sure what the gap was between when the land was purchased and when we actually developed the land, but I was asked to come out and help put in the electrical on the pandal that was going to be constructed.

There was going to be a puja weekend. Shri Mataji was going to arrive on Friday night for an entertainment program, and I showed up on the Saturday before, seven days before. There were 14 holes in the ground and nothing else. I looked at this, and I was like, "You got to be kidding me. We're going to build a pandal, install the electrical, drill wells, build a kitchen... all this in seven days?" I was just like, "Wow."

There were 14 holes, seven on each side, and they were full of rebar that had to be redone. They said, "Yeah, we were going to pour the cement today, but it'll have to come tomorrow." These big footings were for the big metal crossbeams that were going to be there. Seven of these crossbeams; they connected with boards and then the skin of the pandal would go on top of that. And so I'm thinking, "This is Saturday. How are you going to get a cement truck out here on a Sunday in the middle of nowhere?" I said, "I find that hard to believe that's going to happen."

I woke up the next morning, and sure enough, there are cement trucks out there on a Sunday in the middle of nowhere, filling up those holes for the footings. That was the first of many, "Oh, this can't happen," things where I was wrong and wrong and wrong again over the next week. The Divine obviously had other things in mind than my pessimistic thoughts about what could happen.

The main pandal was being constructed over the next few days. I was out gathering electrical supplies and electrical panels, circuit breakers, conduits and wires, and lights and light switches and outlets—all the stuff that one would need to electrify the pandal. I'm kind of wondering who's going to help me do this. One guy named Hanuman from Argentina showed up on about Tuesday or so, and he says, "Oh, yeah, uncle, I can find some people to help. Don't worry."

Then Wednesday rolled around, and we were trying to get some lighting around the camp so people wouldn't be stumbling in the dark. There was this guy, I forget his name, from Austria who was an electrician. He kept reminding me a number of times that he wired Cabella. But their electrical system is quite a bit different than ours, and he was wanting to do things to the European standard using really expensive materials, which we didn't have a budget for. So, very challenging interactions.

Then Thursday morning rolled up. Shri Mataji is coming the next day. I jumped out of my tent and said, "Oh, man, I better get busy. I'll meditate later." Well, I never did meditate. I was, quote, "too busy." I had a major falling out with this guy from Austria, kind of lost it with him, and I went out to the van that had all the electrical supplies in it. Somebody had taken the van on a run to New York to pick up some yogis at the airport. So all the electrical supplies that I needed were gone, most of them. And I said, "How could they have done this?"

So then I took one of the other vans and finished buying up the rest of the electrical supplies I needed. Nothing was going right that day. I didn't meditate. I got in an argument with this guy from Austria. The van took off. I had to drive all the way to Albany to get the supplies. Everything was taking too long. Maybe an hour before dusk, I slammed the door to the van and realized I just locked the keys inside. It was a fitting end to a miserable day.

Then these yuvas come over, and they go, "Uncle, uncle," in their very bright, cheery voices. "Can we help? Can we help?" I said, "Look, I just locked the keys in the van. What are you going to do?" "Oh, well, maybe we can find a coat hanger." I said, "Yeah, whatever," and I kind of blew them off. I got on my cell phone, trying to find reception out there. I was going to try and find a locksmith. You know, I'm still going through my brain, doing all these mental activity solutions, mental solutions to all my problems.

I'm about a minute and a half into the phone call trying to find a locksmith, and I hear this, "Jai Shri Mataji! Jai Shri Mataji! Jai Shri Mataji!" And they go, "Uncle, look, the door is unlocked." And I go, "What?" I looked, and sure enough, the door was unlocked. I felt totally humbled. I hadn't used Sahaja Yoga once the whole day. I tried solving every problem with my ego and my brain. And the yuvas showed me quite clearly how Sahaja Yoga works, especially in these moments of importance, getting ready for a puja. So, totally humbled, I grabbed the keys, thanked them, and went off.

The next morning, Friday, we haven't done any of the electrical work yet, except I think we wired in a transformer. Somebody comes up, "Mark, Mark, hurry up, hurry up. You have to get up. We have to do the electrical today. Shri Mataji is coming tonight." And I said, "No, I'm going to go meditate first." I made the mistake the day before. So I went into the pandal. They had a stage at that point, and Shri Mataji's photo, and had made a little altar. I sat there quietly, closed my eyes, raised my kundalini, and said, "Shri Mataji, you are the doer. There's no way I can do what needs to be done today. I can't do this without your help."

I sat there meditating. I kind of heard somebody walking around me, very close, and I didn't really know what was going on. But I opened my eyes from my meditation and looked up. Some sweet yogini had brought me a plate of food, my breakfast. I didn't even have to go get breakfast; it was right there. So I was eating my breakfast, and Hanuman, which I hadn't seen for days, comes up and says, "Hey, uncle, I found a crew of people to help us today." So I had four helpers right there, finished my breakfast, and we got started.

Smoothly and quickly and effortlessly, things went that day when I meditated and surrendered to Shri Mataji. I remember there was one moment where I was on this really tall ladder. We were passing some of the conduits over the top of the pandal, and I looked down. People were working on the stage. There were, I don't know, 100 people or more just scurrying about, decorating the pandal for the stage. They were still building the ramp for the stage for Shri Mataji's wheelchair. And just all this activity going on. It was almost like I was looking at this time warp, that things were happening at a speed that wasn't really possible, including the work that we were doing.

We just kept plugging away all day long. We made some very simple light fixtures using some conduits, just some poles with light fixtures at the end. They were on all 14 of those big metal crossbeams that went across. We put one on each one, so there were seven on each side. We kind of got lucky because we didn't have tons of light, but the inside of the metal skins of the frame were painted white, so they were really reflective. By pure luck, we got by with the amount of light that we had.

By this time, it's starting to get dark out. The pandal's starting to fill up with yogis. We just finished putting all the lights on, wired in the entertainment center, got all the receptacles wired in, all the switches in. We went to flip on the switches on the right-hand side of the stage, and they all came on. All the yogis started clapping, "Oh, we're going to have light!" And the circuit breaker tripped. I was like, "Oh, my goodness. We got a short circuit somewhere."

So then I went up to Gagan. I said, "Hey, Gagan, do you suppose we could get by with just like one row of lights?" And he was like, "Well, you know, Mark, Shri Mataji's coming, and we really need to do our best." He wasn't going to let me get off easy. So we went through and decided to disconnect one light at a time to figure out where the short circuit was. It was the second light from the front, which happened to be shining on the overhead screen where there was going to be a projection. If that light had been on, it would have washed out the screen. So that light wasn't supposed to be on. The Divine worked out every single little detail. We had lights, and the light that would have washed out the screen was off. I was like, "Jai Shri Mataji," I couldn't believe it.

I walked out. I was going to go to my tent and shower up and get ready for the evening program. As I'm walking from the pandal to my tent, I hear the conches blowing, announcing Shri Mataji's arrival. She came literally minutes after we finished and had everything done. She knew exactly when to come. She was staying an hour or more away from the Canajoharie land, and she knew exactly when to leave to be there exactly when she was supposed to be. I just shook my head. Jai Shri Mataji. It was really a miracle that happened.

It was funny. I was telling this story somewhere in the U.K., and one of the girls who was there that day said, "Yeah, so Uncle Mark, do you know what really happened?" I go, "No. How did you guys unlock that door?" She said, "We just sat there and we just raised our hands like this to the door lock and said, 'Jai Shri Mataji' three times." And she said they could see the door lock just sort of shaking, vibrating, and finally it just came up. So it was literally a miracle.

It just totally recalibrated my whole attitude. When I didn't use Sahaja Yoga, it was a disaster. When I did use Sahaja Yoga and surrendered to Shri Mataji, everything worked out beautifully and in the most impossible way. All my week-long doubts about being able to build a pandal and get water and build a kitchen and all the stuff that we needed to do... it just was shown what the Divine can do, how powerful the Divine is if we just surrender to it. It truly was a miracle getting that pandal on the grounds done in a week. I'm not even sure a crack team of professionals could have done it. So anyway, that's my story.

That's just amazing. I'm just going to pause.

Hi, how are you? I am Patricia Mays. I live in Florida now. We were living in Washington state until last year. My mother is Doris Mendez from Colombia. We are going to tell the stories of Canajoharie. We also saw Canajoharie since the beginning. My mother is going to tell her story first and I'm going to translate.

She's Doris Mendez de Acosta. She's from Colombia. She's going to tell the story of the experience that she had in 2000 in Canajoharie with Shri Mataji. In 2000, they rented a house for Shri Mataji in the little town in Canajoharie because, on the land, we didn't have a house at that time. So they rented two homes, one for Shri Mataji and the next one for the yogis taking care of her.

Shri Mataji came to that little house in Canajoharie in the night. The Colombians and all the South Americans, actually, had arranged Shri Mataji's house. We were waiting for her at the little house, more like 12 or 14 yogis, most of them Colombians and some South Americans. We received her with garlands and flowers. She decided to invite us into the house to sit down next to her at her feet and talk with us.

Shri Mataji asked about Colombia. "What happened in Colombia? What is new in Colombia?" And she asked how the country was doing. So Marilo, who was the leader at that time, showed Shri Mataji some pictures of the political situation in Colombia, which was very hard at that time. There was a lot of violence. When Marilo showed Shri Mataji these pictures and told her the situation, my mother was there with all of us. She asked inside herself, "Please, Shri Mataji, forgive all the Colombians. Forgive all the violence in Colombia. Forgive all the problems in Colombia." She started feeling a fire in her body, like a very strong, strong fire, like something was burning. She kept saying, "Forgive, Shri Mataji, forgive all the Colombians." It was very hot, and she almost felt like she was going to faint and burn. She got a little bit afraid.

In that moment, she felt like she was going to die. So she said, "Oh Mother, please forgive us. If I have to die this moment, please forgive me, and I surrender completely to you. I surrender everything to you."

In that moment when she said, "I surrender completely to your divine powers," she started feeling completely cool, more relaxed. The soul started cooling down, and she started feeling the cool breeze. The change of the vibrations was complete in that moment.

The next day, Shri Mataji asked the yogis that were there in the house to put water at her lotus feet. She was in the garden outside the house. She asked, "Please, the yogis that are there, please put water at my feet." So my mother was there. She was the last one to offer the water. She did it with all her attention and very slowly. The earth seemed like it was very dry. The water made a noise, like the earth was very dry. But many people before her had already poured water. She said, "Mother is cleaning Colombia."

She was the last one to put the water at Shri Mataji's feet. When she put the water, she saw that it made a very strong sound, like something was absorbing it, like it was very thirsty. The water went with a lot of force. In that moment, she was a little bit surprised and she said inside her, "Oh Mother, maybe you are cleaning more of Colombia with your lotus feet."

In that moment, Shri Mataji turned around and looked at my mother, Doris. She looked in her eyes and asked, "How is Colombia? How is everything? Are you going to Cabella this year? Who is going to Cabella from Colombia?" She also asked for the fabric that we, as Colombians, had put all over the house. We put it in the tablecloth, in her bedroom, on her curtains, everywhere was fabric that they brought from Colombia. So she was asking about the fabric, how much cotton it had. She was talking a lot about Colombia. In that moment, my mother felt more and more relaxed. She felt more connected and in reality, feeling a lot more light. After that, she left and she felt so much joy during the whole weekend. She felt she was having so much love and compassion from the Divine Mother the whole weekend. She felt connected, and the vibrations were very lifted.

At the end, Shri Mataji told everybody that we have to ask for peace for Colombia and to finish the guerrillas that were very strong in Colombia at that time.

That is the story of Canajoharie, more or less, that she has for you guys.

Patricia, if Doris would like to tell her other story as well while she's here, that would be lovely.

Okay, now it's my story. I was in the same house when Shri Mataji came to Canajoharie. It was a very amazing moment for us as Colombians and South Americans because the house had no furniture, nothing for Shri Mataji. They told us two days before she came that we had to fix the house. They had just rented it because it took a long time; they couldn't find a place until the last minute, two days before Shri Mataji arrived, actually.

Somehow, the Colombians had brought a lot of pictures and decorations, probably because it was the puja of the South Americans. So we built this house. Practically, we transformed the house. We took out all the pictures, we cleaned it up, and we put all this fabric that Shri Mataji was talking about everywhere. We sewed there all night and all day. We bought all these new decorations and fixed the house, one bedroom in the front and one bedroom downstairs.

The most amazing thing is before Shri Mataji came, before they even called to say when she was coming, we started feeling this deep, deep peacefulness inside all of us. It was a very collective peace, and we knew she was coming. Our Kundalini told us she was getting closer and closer to the house. We kind of slowed down, got ready, changed our clothes, and got completely ready for Shri Mataji. She made us ready because our Kundalini started jumping, and we started feeling it. We would look at each other and say, "Yes, she's here." We would start looking at each other and say, "Wow, she is coming."

It was very fulfilling to feel that love for Shri Mataji. She knew what we did. She calmed us down because we were all rushing, fixing things. She calmed us and got us ready. When she stood at the door, we were in such a state of joy and welcome and were so connected with her. We gave the arti to her, and she came inside. We were supposed to leave, but no, she decided to invite us into her house, into the little living room that maybe only 20 people could fit in. So we fit in there, and she asked us to do a little kind of puja, practically.

We took out her socks, and I had the privilege to be there. She said, "Put kumkum on me and put turmeric." So we put the kumkum and the turmeric. And she said, "Now you sit down." Mr. C.P. was also there, and she started talking with him about Colombia in her language before asking us. After, she started talking with us about Colombia. Many Colombians actually got married that year, maybe five or six, and are still married in America. So, it was a very auspicious time for us as Colombians to be there in America with her, to be so close and so full of vibrations.

Something that we asked her in that moment was, "Please, Shri Mataji, give us the power to express Sahaja Yoga, to do your job, to be your instrument." And we see now many Colombians are doing this here in America and all over the world. That day, I felt a boom. I feel very blessed for that moment.

That was in Canajoharie. I have another one from Canajoharie with my little son. He was only three months old in 2002. We decided to go to Canajoharie and go camping with this little baby. It was very hot, 80 degrees, and I was very worried because the baby didn't want to drink. He wanted to sleep all the time. We had to give him a shower to wake him up.

At the same time, I decided to make a very big album of all the children of America that had been born three years before and present it to Shri Mataji after the puja. I didn't expect there were so many. When I started doing the album, I expected maybe 50 children. No. I had like 300 pictures. So I had to buy another album and another album and another album. All the yogis started helping me to put it together to show Shri Mataji.

After the puja, I asked if I could present it, and they said yes. So I brought my baby with me, and I brought the album. Another yogini who was also married at Canajoharie had another baby, Liliana Walsh. So we went together and offered the book. Immediately she opened the book, she said, "All from America?" I said, "Yes, Shri Mataji. All these children are from America." And she said, "We have to open a school here. Because there are so many children, we have to open a school in this place." She talked to Manoj and said, "Oh, we need to open a school. Look at that, so many children in America." For me, it's a very historical moment.

Also, I put the baby at the feet of Shri Mataji. I put Janaka at the feet of Shri Mataji. I looked at him and I felt his kundalini moving in the top of his head, in his fontanelle bone. I said, "Oh my God, it's so beautiful to be able to see how powerful she is." How powerfully she blessed him.

After that, they did the school of Canajoharie. The school started one or two years after this. I have many stories in Canajoharie, but that is the most important of them.

Well, that's beautiful. But if either you or your mother want to tell another story, Patricia, I think we've got a bit more time.

Oh. I want to tell you a very amazing story in Colombia.

Please, yes. That would be lovely.

In 1992—I don't remember the dates exactly, but she came many times to Colombia—Shri Mataji decided to go to Medellín. In 1992, Medellín was very violent. Really, the narco-traffic took over the whole city and started putting bombs in the streets, in the malls, everywhere. It was a mess because the police were fighting back very strongly. They wanted to practically destroy the city. And Shri Mataji, despite that, said, "I'm going to Medellín." Mr. C.P. said, "You don't go to Medellín. It's too, too violent." But she insisted.

We weren't sure if she was coming to Medellín or not. We planned everything in Bogota, and we did a very big program where 2,500 people showed up. It was an amazing program. And after, she said, "No, we are going to Medellín." We hadn't prepared a lot. We only reserved a hotel room for her in case, and we also reserved an auditorium, a small one for maybe 900 or 1,000 people.

So we jumped on the plane and went with Shri Mataji to Medellín. We got there and we didn't have a plan for publicity, very little. So we were a little bit nervous, but Shri Mataji was very confident that it was going to be perfect. That program was going to be very good for the city, very good for all. So we went with her and surrendered everything.

When we got there, there was a very small group of yogis living in Medellín, maybe 10 people maximum. They received her at the airport with flowers. At that moment, a journalist was there, and he asked, "Who is she?" And one of the yogis told him that this is a very important spiritual human being, and she's coming to do a very nice program. He realized that she spoke English, and he spoke with her. He said, "Shri Mataji, I want to interview you." And Shri Mataji said, "Oh, of course, come with me. Come to the hotel with me." So he jumped in the car with Shri Mataji and started talking with her.

We all went to the hotel and entered the big presidential suite. We sat down on the floor around her, listening to the journalist asking questions to Shri Mataji. He started asking things like, "What do you want to do here? Who are you?" At one point, he said, "How about Jesus Christ? Who is Jesus Christ for you?" She said, "Jesus Christ is very important, especially because he gives us forgiveness, the power of forgiveness." He said, "Wow. The power of forgiveness?" She said, "Yes, you will feel it. Put your hands like this." And she said, "You are going to say, all together here, you are going to say the Lord's Prayer." She said, "You are going to say it in Spanish."

So we all put our hands out, and we said the Lord's Prayer. After we finished, we were completely connected. The journalist was completely absorbed. He couldn't believe what he was feeling. And Shri Mataji said, "Do you see who Jesus Christ is?" He was like, "Yeah, that's incredible what I'm feeling." So Shri Mataji said, "Now what are you going to do? How are we going to tell the rest of the people that I am here and I'm going to give you this knowledge?" And he said, "I'm going to the radio right now, and I'm going to tell everybody to come tonight to the program." He asked her, "I want to ask you a favor. Allow me to introduce you in the room." And Shri Mataji said, "Of course, come and introduce me."

It was incredible because after he left, we felt overwhelming light and overwhelming happiness and joy. But another blessing was that he went to the radio, he invited everybody, and the room was full with more or less 3,000 people waiting for their realization. The introduction from the journalist was more beautiful than any yogi could have done. It was incredible, so well done. We need to find the video. The video quality is not so well, but it's very beautiful.

It was an amazing experience because from there, Medellín changed completely. It's another city. It's a city very well done, very clean, very perfect. It has a metro, it has many universities, and it is wealthy in many ways. They have a lot of yogis now. They have a lot of programs there. It's a beautiful city now. Jai Shri Mataji.

Jai Shri Mataji. Oh, Jai Shri Mataji, Patricia. That was a wonderful, wonderful story. And I think very relevant to our times as well, just how we as yogis can change whole cities.

Shri Mataji has this power with us.

Well, we're her channels. We have to.

We have to. We have to, yeah.

Yeah. So, I'm just going to stop the recording now.
