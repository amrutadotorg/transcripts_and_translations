Such a beautiful puja talk. It's an Easter puja talk of Shri Mataji in Turkey in 1999. What she is saying there very much resonates somehow with this chat we are going to have with you today. Maureen, Pat, Jamal, and Uncle Bala, thank you all for joining us to remember and share your times with the Adi Shakti, with Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi herself.

So, today's session, we start with the times when she actually started the work in the West: 1975. So this is when Pat and Maureen, you got your Realization, is that right?

Yes, September 1975. Yes, that's right.

Which is, interestingly, 50 years ago this year. Amazing. Could you briefly—I know both of you have shared your stories—but could you briefly recollect and capture those moments for us, please? Who got to know of it first? Was it Pat? Was it you, Maureen?

It was Maureen. I chased you down the road, didn't I, Maureen?

We were living with a load of hippies, just as Shri Mataji mentions in the talks. And they didn't think Pat was in a good enough condition to join them, but they thought they'd take me along. There was a lady... yes, Maureen. She was a Sahaja Yogi; she's passed away now. And she was taking me. But Pat heard about it, and he came and joined. And luckily, because he was my brother, they couldn't turn him away. It would be sort of too rude. They were quite good at being rude, but to that point, they couldn't carry it. So we all went to King's Cross together and were taken to this man's house.

In Clare Court, just off King's Cross. The flat, wasn't it?

The flat, yes. Shri Mataji had been invited by this man who had met her at the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan in New Oxford Street, where it was at that time, the Indian Cultural Centre. He had been to one of her talks there and invited her to come and meet his yoga group, wasn't it, Pat? His Hatha Yoga group. He had a Hatha Yoga group.

What did you experience when you first walked in the room, Maureen?

Well, I just thought she was a goddess. That was my first feeling. She was dressed all in white, and she was fighting with these... this Indian gentleman who was knelt with a turban on. And she was dealing with all sorts of stuff, like this. And she had a watch on with no numbers on it. I thought, "Well, she doesn't need to know the time because she's a goddess."

She was saying about the fingers related to different chakras, and I felt very strongly that if she had decided that the Vishuddhi finger was actually the thumb, then she would change it because she was totally in charge. It was just her knowledge entirely. It wasn't something that she was preaching or something she had learned; it was totally coming from her. And, if she said black was white, then tomorrow black would be white. It was just that strong.

My friend told me to take my shoes off. I said, "Okay, all right." And sit down, put my hands out. And Shri Mataji, after a minute, came and talked to us. She said, "What do you feel?" And I said, "Oh, I feel something in my hands." And she magically said, "May God bless you, you've got it." And I thought, "I have no idea what she means, but I've got it." It just felt incredible. Absolutely incredible.

And for six months, she pinned my kundalini up because she said it was so wibbly-wobbly. It needed pinning up because we'd come from this hippie background of drugs and dropping out of society and basically denying everything to do with the norm. But it had damaged me a great deal.

What did it feel like with your kundalini pinned up?

Just completely there all the time. Just completely there. Yeah. There was another hippie who came. He said to me, "Why do you stay?" And I just looked at him as if, "Why would you go? Why would you leave?" Yes. There was absolutely no question about it. It wasn't like, "This I will do for the rest of my life." You were just... that's it. It's literally like coming home, but on a very, very, very deep level.

I can remember someone asked me about it, and I said, "I'm here to save the world now." And that's just what it felt like. It didn't feel like a handful of mad hippies in a room. It felt like an enormous gathering of something really, really powerful. Yes. Even though it was just us. Does that make sense?

And Shri Mataji worked on Pat, who was in quite a...

I didn't get a, "You've got it." I got a, "This one's sick," if you remember.

Yes. But she got you to put one hand out the window, one hand to her. I remember that.

That was afterwards. But did you remember her giving me vibrated water in a bottle? Vibrated water in a bottle. And you put a special sticker on it so it wouldn't... you never ran out of it. But I've written in my book all about what I experienced when we went there, but I never really talked to you much about what you experienced.

Go on. And also, wasn't it that you had a very limited lifespan at that time, Pat?

Yeah. At one stage, Mother said that I wouldn't live more than six months. He was in a terrible state. I mean, he was living on Mars bars and drugs and Coca-Cola.

When you first came?

Yeah, when he first came. When I first came, I was thin as a rake, believe it or not. Yards of hair.

So, you actually walked in there and you thought, "This is a goddess."

Absolutely. And it was nothing I'd ever thought of before. It wasn't like anything that I'd read about. I'd read the Bhagavad Gita, I think that was it, and Kahlil Gibran. And they had moved me greatly, but I'd never seen... it was not in my experience to sort of casually think of people in those ways at all.

It's the same with me. I mean, I couldn't put a name to it, but it was just something colossal.

It was just completely awesome. It was so awesome that I couldn't think about it. And I wondered about it later. You remember... well, when Mother was vibrating that water in that bottle, I saw her turn around and open the door behind her and put the bottle into this atomic furnace and then take it out and give it to me. And afterwards, I wondered if she'd actually done that or if I'd just been seeing something on a higher level. But at the time, it just seemed kind of matter-of-fact. But I couldn't put a name to it. I didn't know who or what Shri Mataji was, but I felt she was just like Christ. And I didn't know why I was thinking that either, because I wasn't supposed to believe in religion. I was supposed to be a rebel. So it was kind of confusing.

I think what was astonishing might get over why not as many... you know, the others didn't have that strong feeling. The people that we were with sort of fell away gradually.

Yeah, but that went on for a while, didn't it? I just couldn't believe how people couldn't see it.

Well, how people could meet Mother and then go away. I used to wonder why people in shops didn't all fall at her feet. How could they just serve her and look her in the eye and then carry on? So strong, so strong. And it did feel that she was immense, not in size, but in, I suppose it must be power. Presence. Her presence was just huge, just huge.

So this is September 1975, isn't it?

Yeah. 15th of September.

15th September. Wow.

It was a Sunday. Amazing.

So how did things move on from there? What happened?

She came to Gavin's flat in North Gower Street. She must have come the next week. And Pat, you came to that one.

No, I missed the next week. You missed the next one. And Mother asked after me. You told me afterwards because you went. Yes. And that touched me. So I kind of thought, that's weird. Something distracted me. And then I went, and then we got invited to her screen... to Mother's house.

Yes. And then I missed the next weekend.

That Richard Ignatius... Ignatius, yes. Mentioned no names. Does that bring out some memories? Her screen, this is.

Her screen, yes. That's quite early on. And the lady with the red T-shirt, Marie, is the lady that brought us to Shri Mataji. She's French. So we have a great deal to thank her for. And this was in Mother's garden at her screen. And that's her granddaughter. The younger one was Nano, and the bigger one was Anupana. This is her screen as well, the gardens. Beautiful.

And this is our seminar that we had in Weston-super-Mare. I mean, you can see how Mother had to make do and mend, if you like. Look where we are, in a stockroom, storeroom above an Indian restaurant belonging to one of her nieces, I think it was, in Weston-super-Mare.

And that photo is one of a series of photos in which Shri Mataji was trying to make me smile. The first one, he's very, very serious. Shri Mataji's hand goes up higher and higher, and as it goes up higher, he eventually smiles because his heart was in such a terrible state.

Okay, so what happened after this then?

After this, we had the meeting at her screen, and a lot of hippies were there. I mean, so many. And we stayed the weekend. We all slept on the floor.

Was that the weekend I missed?

I think it was. Yes. So this is later on, this one that you can see here, but this is where we were. And Shri Mataji worked on me. She oiled my head—just incredible things to clear me out of all... because I had been taking drugs. I hadn't done it for very long, thankfully, and not quite as assiduously as Pat had to try and achieve his Realization. I mean, it was all about trying to achieve nirvana and achieve this state. And then we met Mother, and it happened like that. And everything else became... we stopped it immediately. Because what was the point? It just took you off.

And so that went on for... I mean, not long after we met Mother, she went to India, didn't she?

Yes. That Christmas, she went to India for, I thought it was three months, but probably even longer. So after her birthday in March, definitely. And she had said that we could go to India with her next time. So we stopped being hippies and got jobs and started saving money to go to India. And then when Mother came back, we were in such a state, she said there's no way we'd be able to go to India. So Pat blew all his money on a record player, I think.

It wasn't a record player. It was a stereo system. It was a really good one.

Oh, sorry. I beg your pardon. Stereo. Because the one thing we could do is listen to good music. We'd given everything else up, so we were listening to music.

What did you define as good music?

There was only one, mainly, and it was called... what was it? Call of the Valley. That was the only one we knew was all right because we'd heard Mother play it at her house. That one over and over again.

Oh, okay. It didn't matter. There were special ragas for different bits of the day, but we didn't know that, so we just played it all day long. In fact, we still play it at our meetings when we're meditating now because I still think it's one of the most beautiful meditative musics.

We actually still play it now. You do as well.

Yeah, I like playing it. Well, also, it takes me straight back to those days. The good old days.

So did the first Havans happen at her screen as well?

Yes, that's right. We had a Havan outside. We had no idea what a Havan was. And the gentleman on the left in white, Satpal, officiated, but Shri Mataji really was the true officiator. She would stop all the proceedings and guide us all through it. And basically, we were taught that this is how you clear things out on a vast scale. So especially to us hippies, it was incredible because it was actually doing something. You really felt the drama of it. You can see there Mother's blowing into her hand. And you felt like you were in some sort of incredible storm at sea, fighting the demons in this Havan. Very, very powerful. Very strong.

Even though we hardly knew what we were doing, you could feel the immensity of it, and that it wasn't just us that were there somehow, if that makes any sense. We were representatives of types, and Mother was working out through us. And this was 1976, wasn't it? When Mother would come back.

That's right. And this is how Mother would work on us. We would see how our vibrations were for a very long time. For a very long time, yes. And other people, we'd all stand around, supposedly helping Mother with our hands out. But she would suddenly go, and then you'd know you're right. But boy, it took a while.

So remind us again, there's only a handful of you there at this time in 1976, isn't it?

Yeah, well, it was basically seven, with some coming and going. So Gregoire was one of the seven, but he wasn't in this one. Marie was one of the seven, but she wasn't always there. Gregoire was there, he was kind of present by letter every week. And then later on, Jamal came. But before that, we went to India. So it was nearly two years, wasn't it?

Yes, it was. So this is before we went to India. And that little puja dish that I'm holding there, I think I said before, is at the castle in Cabella, in the puja chest of beautiful ornaments that are used at the pujas. And the little Shirdi Sai Baba in silver was sat on there. So yes, you can see what a motley crew we were. And looking at Shri Mataji, it's like, wow. It's just absolutely unbelievable, isn't it? Incredible. Incredible.

I can't believe that in there I look taller than her. I never felt taller than Shri Mataji.

Neither did I. No. Incredible. Totally blissed us out. It's so amazingly beautiful and so loving of Shri Mataji to have granted this. Because at this time, she is a householder. She's a diplomat.

Yes. So she's hosting diplomatic parties, going to social occasions, and then somehow in amongst all this, there is this divine plan that she is unfolding. She would be having dinner at Downing Street and then dealing with us at the weekends. Tell us some more about it, please, because for us, it's not possible to imagine.

She would have us come and stay at her house. I mean, you were there, Jamal, doing that, weren't you? And she would cook for us. And it would be long talks on things. But she would use every instance to explain things to us, whether it be something that came on the TV or something that had happened to someone. It would be a way of explaining things further to us on a deeper level. And we would catch trains with her to and from Victoria. Long journeys.

And we'd go in her diplomatic car. Sorry, go on.

I remember being on the tube train with Mother. That was extraordinary. She was just standing there, talking to us as usual with the train rattling along, and all these completely bemused, ordinary people sitting there.

Yes. It went on as normal, all the time.

Well, of course, when we did that program in Cambridge. You went all the way there sitting on Mother's lap, didn't you?

Yes. We got invited to give a program in Cambridge, and we all went in her big diplomatic car, but there wasn't space. So she said I could sit on her lap in the front, as I was the smallest and the youngest. And I tried really hard to almost levitate. I wasn't squashing Mother. But I cut my hand just before she came, my Vishuddhi finger, and she held my Vishuddhi all the way in the journey to make it right. Just look after it. How could you even think for a second to do everything for Mother? She did everything for us. Everything, on every level.

And that was the Cambridge meeting where all the people were sort of old fogies and stuff?

Yeah, they were all drunk. And the big hosts hurried them all out quickly when Mother asked them to come and see her afterwards. And you remember, Mother kept laughing about it for weeks afterwards. They were in such a state. It was an old people's home, I think.

Sorry, remind us when this incident happened. Was it the same time when Shri Mataji stopped by at your place, Jamal?

I think it must have been before. It was before. I think it was not that long before the first Caxton Hall meeting, probably. So it was '77. And that was the one where I actually went back with Shri Mataji to her screen on my own in the car. And I was with her in the room, and she was talking about Mary and Jesus, and I suddenly saw her as Mary. And I couldn't do anything. I couldn't speak. I was just... I could feel she was talking about Christ, and I felt all her sorrow. I was absolutely flawed. And she looked at me and just took it down, took it back to sort of normality, if you like. She could see that I just couldn't cope. Speechless and stunned. And the sorrow, the sorrow that I felt that she felt for Christ, was just unbearable. Absolutely unbearable.

Do you think it happened in September 1977, when I was away? You remember when I left?

It could be. It could be. It must have been just that time. If it's in '77, it would have been that time in September.

I think so. Before that, you were in India.

Yes, that's right. And then we started the Caxton Hall meetings. Because you came before Caxton Hall, from the Mind, Body, and Soul... escapade.

I can still remember you, Jamal, when you went to work on Gus, and then you sort of staggered away holding your head.

I know. Saying, "I definitely now believe in collective consciousness."

That's a headache of his. That's true. And it happened with other people as well. We used to hold our heads with splitting headaches. Working on people was exhausting, absolutely exhausting. Now you work on someone at a show, and you just go from one to the other and you feel better. Then, after about three people, you were on your knees. It was very difficult, actually. It was much more difficult in those days than it is now. Now you can just speak to people, and they say, "Oh, I felt everything you said."

Absolutely. But there was no collective, also. There was just us. And we didn't know how to work on ourselves. We didn't know how to do anything.

Foot soaking... we would just sit and eat, I think. That was it.

We used to foot soak a bit, quite early on. But we didn't know how to... we didn't know about the chakras. We were just learning. We didn't have the sort of... well, it's like now, there's a booklet. I can remember one of them working on herself like this because she knew that Mother did it from behind, so she was desperately working on herself like that. We just didn't know. We did whatever felt... we didn't know anything.

We knew nothing about pujas or anything. Remember we asked Mother to get a book about it from India? And eventually, oh my god, that huge, huge tome arrived. I've still got it. It's about a hundred pages, and it's about A3, and it's reams and reams of everything you do in a puja.

And you have that book?

Yeah, still got it. But it was from India. It wasn't a Sahaja Yoga book, you see.

But I don't know any A3 book, and I am from India.

Well, someone had typed it up. It was just sheets and sheets. I'll have to look it out. It's... first you did the puja to the leaf, then the puja to this, and then the puja to the leaf after that. And after about three hours, you got to the beginning of the actual puja. And it was just mind-boggling. But we knew nothing of all this.

When we did have pujas, Shri Mataji directed them, really. You know, like Pat said, she said, "I'm doing puja to myself." Basically, she couldn't find anyone who could read Sanskrit. And she said, "I'll just have to worship myself."

You can see recordings, even now, where there were quite a few of us, where Shri Mataji would stop everything and say, "No, no, no. This isn't right." You know, people are getting really into reading things and stuff, and she said, "No, no, no. We don't need to do that anymore."

With Shri Mataji's direction... because very carefully, Shri Mataji doesn't want her children to go in one direction or the other. It's always the middle path, isn't it? So she was particularly directing how you should do the puja and how you should do the Havan. And they were particularly long in those times, perhaps, because there were so few yogis, whether in the West or India itself. So you were learning about the chakras, the deities, as such?

And everything, as we went along. We learned about everything. Luckily, Douglas recorded everything. And Shri Mataji... I can remember at Gavin's flat, so that's going to be quite a bit before things got going, Shri Mataji gave talks on each of the chakras. And they were only audio talks, but they're very deep. Very, very deep.

What was it like? You said you would stay over at Shri Mataji's place, and this is 1976, '77. What was it like? What was every day like? Give us a sense, please.

Right, okay. For us, you were always, obviously, in Shri Mataji's presence. And you weren't constantly in bliss because we were in such a state. I can remember that they would start the cooking quite early on, and I'd be really hungry.

When you say "they," it is...?

The cook and the people that came with Shri Mataji from India. Sometimes Shri Mataji would cook, but quite often, they would cook. And the amazing thing was that Shri Mataji would be talking to us about vibrations... the subjects were just endless. But the talks and everything... and me, personally anyway, I'd be hungry and I'd smell this and I think, "Wonder how long we've got before..." But then Shri Mataji would take you somewhere where you'd go beyond that desire and beyond that feeling. So you went through... it was as if she was taking you through the stages of how to sort of watch yourself, how to witness how you felt about things, and to see your weaknesses, if you like.

I can remember at the Guru Puja we had at Gavin's house, where Shri Mataji sat on the brown sofa with the flowers between her feet, I was in such a place where I didn't feel like eating. I literally was staring at this food, and I had no desire to eat. I was just full of vibrations. And then when we came out of the puja and we went away to our homes, I thought, "I'm really hungry now." But I just felt like food was a sort of an annoyance that I had to... I didn't want to interrupt what I felt by eating, to go down to that level. I suppose a better level would be to eat without thinking about it. But for me, it was novel to get to a place where I wasn't hungry.

Do you remember at one point, Shri Mataji decided we shouldn't eat at all before pujas?

Oh, absolutely. Every puja we didn't eat before. And then eventually, she decided that we were such miserable specimens that we couldn't keep going without food. It was distracting us too much.

You've got to remember that during all this period, there was no Sahaja Yoga. There were no bhajan books, there were no mantras, there was no anything.

Did you raise your kundalini, take bandhans, the way we do it?

Yeah, oh, absolutely. Shri Mataji taught us. It was a bit different, right? We used to put bandhans on first and then raise the kundalini, if you remember.

Sounds like one of those Sahaja arguments.

I have an old audio tape in which Mother said—and I can't find it, it's one of those little cassette things—she said the bandhans are like the bookends. You start with the bandhan, you do everything in between—clearing yourself out and all that, raising kundalini—and then you end with the bandhan. And those are the bookends. And somehow it disappeared.

It changed. I think it's because at some of the talks, Shri Mataji would get people to raise their kundalini and then put a bandhan on. If you look, she actually does that, and probably people copied that. But what interests me is you have Shri Mataji putting on a bandhan, and she does it really, really big. So when I see people doing this, what are they actually doing? And above the head. But you know, you have Shri Mataji doing it there. Why would you...

The other little change I remember, which I realize is not significant, but just how it's changed, because I still remember Mother showing me when I was staying in her house that you come up and you tie it above the head. And I thought it was changed for America because she said, "The bhoots are so bad that you tilt it back and then tie it." And then now you see the newer videos of Mother where she's actually looking at her hands with her head back. And I thought, "That's invented for America." So I just do what she taught me. I haven't changed yet.

Well, when we were first taught the Mahamantra, it was to say "Swarupini" instead of "Sakshat." And then, on an India tour that we didn't go on, I remember everyone coming back saying, "It's all been changed. You now say 'Sakshat.'" Because "Swarupini" means "in the form of," and "Sakshat" means "exactly the same as." "Swarupini" is to sort of... so our egos don't get too upset. But then, "Sakshat" is... yes, Sakshat. That was a change. We used to say mantras with "Shri Bhagwati" and all that, and she took that out.

Right. "Bhagwati" had to go. And if you go to some far-flung countries, they still say "Bhagwati" because it hasn't reached there yet.

I wonder if it was Shri Mataji playing with our conditioning. Because I can remember feeling really upset that this person came and told me that the mantra changed. Like, "What you know is no... Oh no, no. You have to get with it now. It's this."

This mantra change... I don't know if this is the forum to bring it up, but years ago, when I was with Tony in Mother's house back in England, some leader came from Europe—names won't be mentioned—and he had a small group of his collective with him. Mother was talking sweetly, like she does, on a human plane, and he was saying that Brahma is really very important, the creator of the world, and Saraswati is just his energy. So remember how it used to be "Saraswati Brahmadeva"? And he said it should be "Brahmadeva Saraswati." And Mother said, "That's a good idea." And I immediately knew that's not a good idea. After this guy left, she turned to us and she said, "See, they even want to change my mantras." But in front of his yogis, she didn't say a word.

Interesting. So, I wonder how some things change because somebody's ego has to be kept happy and the followers are not to be disturbed. Because she used to say, "Don't argue with your leader."

Interesting. You were asking just now what it was like in those days. What was it like in the sense that... it's true, as Pat said, Sahaja Yoga had not really started, it hadn't taken off yet. But I remember something interesting is that though we were a very small group of people, and though it was very difficult to actually work on new people who came, especially from false gurus, Shri Mataji had a massive attention on the small group that we were. There's such a massive attention that you felt her virtually 24 hours out of 24 hours.

Yeah, absolutely. It was amazing. Anything you did, she knew about it. She would even talk to you about it. You think, "Oh, Mother was there then." But you don't realize who she is then. You don't realize exactly what she is in her cosmic dimension.

We were very much uplifted the whole time. It wasn't until the collective of new people got beyond a certain point—and I think probably when the TM people started coming in—that I felt that kind of let go a bit. Because Mother had to deal with bigger issues. And you just felt that you weren't just being lifted up all the time. It was more of a struggle.

I remember when they came to Birmingham, and it was absolutely a torture. When she brought them back to my house, it changed. I felt that things got very... it was like this lovely, cozy little family that was extremely loving that we had. And suddenly, the right side... and I guess we needed it because we were quite laid back. But I remember the following year when the hippies came, it sort of helped to balance things out.

Which year is this?

So the TMs came in '79. And then the hippies came, I think around 1980 or so, from Brighton. But I do feel that it was a bit like, "We've got to swim, and then we had to jolly well jump in and get going." And that's how we learned. We were very spoiled. I can actually remember thinking that we're like little children with our mother, and I hope we don't have to grow up too soon.

I never even thought of growing up. I thought it would be a permanent state of affairs.

No, because Mother kept making it obvious that she was preparing us. Preparing us for this public program at Caxton Hall. And I was terrified. I thought, I knew what a lot of seekers were like, and I thought, "My God, we're going to have a whole horde of these people in here. What is that going to be like?" And then Mother made us sit on these chairs on the stage with her, and that was just the ultimate. Never mind feeling the vibrations; I sat there in agony. During Gavin's talk and then Mother's talk. I was trying to look all evolved, and I was just in agony. My whole body was like being put in a torture chamber or something. It was just pains of agony everywhere. It was okay after a while, but I can never forget sitting on that stage feeling horrified and in agony and trying to look all holy and evolved at the same time.

You should have saved your energy, Pat. Because I walked in there, and I saw this Indian lady in a white sari and a rather motley crew on either side of her.

We weren't pulling it off, were we?

Tell us about your experience, Uncle Bala. Because somewhere you have mentioned that you had been seeking for a very long time. And unlike Pat, Maureen, and a lot of seekers of that time perhaps, you had an idea of the deities and the protocol. So what was your expectation when you saw Shri Mataji?

Firstly, I should tell you that, I'm embarrassed to say, I wasn't very much into the deities and so on because I had a mixed-up Christian bringing with some Hindu. So the only deity I knew about was Ganesha, which was minimal. And the other thing was Saraswati, which is for study. But I was seeking enlightenment, as you know.

On my way to India, I came there. But in hindsight, I realized that Mother's timing was perfect. And I have to thank these three old yogis here for doing Caxton Hall. Because in '76, I had that... basically, Mother gave me my Realization, this powerful Kundalini experience, on Sahasrara Day in 1976 up in the Midlands. And I just wanted to drop out of my studies and go find this spiritual teacher. And I'm so glad I never found Mother, because I would have quit, and I'd have never graduated.

So when I came in '77, it was on the way to India because I had just graduated, and I thought I'll go off to India and find a real guru somewhere in the Himalayas. And so I came to this meeting. I walked in, and there was this Indian lady sitting there, which was not the male guru I expected. And there was, as I said, this motley crew of hippie-like people on either side, and a very scruffy-dressed guy standing at the mic rambling on about something. So, unlike Maureen, I'm so impressed that she thought this was a goddess. I mean, that took me six months before I had an experience of who Shri Mataji is.

And I know Jamal wasn't there, but I think it was Pat, Maureen, Gavin, of course... Jane might have been there. And Doug, maybe, because he was doing all the electronics. And then this guy came in a suit who looked like a mafia thug, seriously, just carrying a bouquet of flowers. And he walked up and put them on the stage. And that was Tony. You can say that it was a far cry from what I thought saints would look like, because Mother kept saying, "These are saints, these are saints," in her talk. The talk was wonderful, the things she spoke about. But I just don't know how Pat and Maureen could feel all this for the very first time. It's just amazing.

It was a smaller room and there were less people, I suppose. And we had that... Mother's power was just there. Absolutely everywhere. It became kind of a bit more subtle and abstract. But even then, it was still powerful. I'll never forget how the atmosphere in the room in Caxton Hall changed. You know, after the beginning which was torturous, by the time Mother got off the stage and started working on people, you just felt like we all belonged to one family. It was amazing.

She did all the working. You guys just stood around.

We used to follow her like this.

That's right. I used to wonder what was going on, because you had your hand stuck up behind her or beside her. She came around and was doing all the waving of the hands. And one thing I must mention about Pat: I came for a follow-up a couple of weeks later at Gavin's flat. And I was quite startled to see this spiritual person who I'd come to meet eating meat. She was rolling up slices of ham or whatever and eating them with her fingers. And I was going, "Wow, how come she's eating meat?" I thought you had to be a vegetarian and so on.

But then after that thought, you're in that presence, and suddenly everything disappears, and you're just... you're no longer aware. You're just completely crawled into this heavenly space. It's just a complete maya. But anyway, that's the first foot soak I had with Mother in front of her. And the person who brought me the bowl was you, Pat. So I turned to him and said, "Pat, go get hot water." And I was just blown away. "What's this hot water business?" And it's the second time I'm meeting her. This was the first follow-up, and you bring a bowl of water, and she says, "Put more salt in it." You have to think from the viewpoint of someone who has never encountered anything like this. This is just happening.

The foot soak was at Gavin's flat, in Gower Street, which is where Jamal met Mother, isn't it, Jamal?

Yeah. I must admit, Gower Street was a heavenly place for me. What amazed me was to see Shri Mataji doing all these everyday things. Like, she would say, "Okay, now I need to go and buy some..." and then another day she said, "Okay, I need to buy some antique furniture." And she got some antique furniture from around the corner from Gavin's. And another time, she did all these things.

When she went to Ashley Gardens, because she lived in the city center, she did all the things that everybody would do in a city like London. Going to Woolworths, doing some shopping, and then going to that department store, Army and Navy. One day, we went with her—maybe you were there, Maureen—to the hairdresser. We left her there and said, "Okay, we'll come back later." And when we came back and she finished, she had a haircut, and she came and said, "You know, this woman who was cutting my hair was wondering why all this wind was coming from her head." And one of them felt that wind, and the other one said, "I can't understand, I can really dance now. I feel completely cured." And she started to dance in that hairdressing studio. It was just amazing how she managed.

Because this is what I think many Sahaja Yogis would like to know: What was it like for Shri Mataji as a householder in a city like London? How was she living? And these everyday things were just amazing. We used to go to the bathroom center to buy accessories. We used to go to the German food center. Remember that? Where CP used to like to buy food from there.

And I like to tell people, especially the newcomers, is that in those days, Shri Mataji judged everything from vibrations. Including directions. If you went somewhere and someone made a mistake, she would say, "Oh, the vibrations have gone that way." And she would redirect the driver and say, "You have to go this way." Everything was vibrations. Absolutely everything. The furniture she bought, the things... the different essences of wood that she used to show us and explain how they had coefficients.

There is an interesting story about the coefficient of vibrations. I don't know if it happened in Weston-super-Mare and Pat and you, Maureen, were there. But I remember once, maybe it was in Ashley Gardens, she had salt and pepper on the table. And she moved those dispensers of salt and pepper. She said, "If I put them this way, the vibratory coefficient will be different. Depending on how you place things, the coefficient will change." And we didn't go very deep into it, but some people actually talk about and show it. It talks about the vibratory harmony that you would normally want to achieve through placing things in a certain way and achieving the maximum of vibrations.

Is that... would you relate that, Jamal, to what physicists are discovering only recently about particles and how, where they are located, they still can communicate with one another? And when you observe the particle, it behaves differently. When it's not observed, it could be in a different position. There's so much that's slowly creeping out from the research.

Talking about this one, she said, "In every atom, you have a spirit." That's where it comes from. We just use different words for it now.

So tell us, there was time for spiritual evolution, but also there were times when Shri Mataji would relax with you guys, perhaps?

It was all about spiritual evolution. Even when we were relaxing with her.

What was it like? Tell us what it was like.

Well, she would put on a TV program to distract us when she was working on us. So that... I mean, she didn't tell us that. She'd put a program on, say, "This is good." And then she'd suddenly go, "Ha!" And she said it was because our attention was caught with the program, so we weren't hanging on to the block any longer. We weren't so involved. Because she said it was like spaghetti, and if she pulled it out too fast, it would hurt us. So we had to let go a little bit to enable her to get it. So everything she would use as a way for the vibrations. There was never a downtime. But you were always blissed out.

It was hard work as well. I mean, we were messed up. For me personally, and Pat probably the same—I don't know about you, Bala and Jamal—but we had a lot to sort of work out. So I think for me, personally, as I say, Shri Mataji pinned my kundalini up because I think it protected me while I... it's like being in a chrysalis, you know, while you evolve. That's how I'd say it was.

Remember when Mother was in that flat at Sloane Square for a while? We'd been moving from her screen. Remember we had to move a lot of her furniture one day? And we'd heaved all this furniture up and down these stairs. And Mother looked at us and said, "Hmm, now that you're tired, you're absorbing vibrations better." And I thought, "Uh oh, it looks like there's going to be a lot of work ahead." Boy was I right.

And in fact, I remember we all slept on the floor, and Shri Mataji was on the sofa that night. And she said we had to wake up at a certain time. I felt Shri Mataji touch the top of my head and I woke up, but she was on the sofa like six feet away.

The time we all fell asleep in a line, channeling vibrations from Mother. I woke up suddenly as well, and Mother was sitting there looking at us. And we all sort of got up and carried on. We'd been sitting in this line clearing out vibrations for hours, and then we all fell asleep eventually. And then we woke up at crack of dawn and carried on. It was a lot of hard work. Basically, all the time.

Physically, because we damaged ourselves, and spiritually, we damaged ourselves. But it was constantly trying to get us into that space where we were able to let go of all that physical discomfort or whatever. I can remember pressing Mother's feet to get the vibrations, and half of me was absolutely in awe of what was happening, and the other half was dying to lie down. And I was fighting this. It was really very tiring, rubbing Mother's feet. She'd keep saying, "Harder, harder, harder," and you just feel like you're going to die. But you just have to keep going. But it was a battle with yourself. Because part of you absolutely knew what you were doing was unbelievably, incredibly amazing. And then, as I say, you were fighting this very human... like the body... the spirit is willing, the body is weak.

So we're very glad and grateful, first of all, to Shri Mataji for all her love and patience, and also for you all who have stuck at it with that dedication and that total surrender. Which is something else, actually. Even for us practicing Sahaja Yogis, the strength and the confidence with which you speak, it's like Shri Mataji is giving you that firsthand experience to share with all of us. So we're so grateful that you guys stuck it out. Thank you very much on behalf of all the Yogis the world over.

How was it for you, Jamal and Uncle Bala, subtly after you've got your Realization? Was it equally as tough as Pat and Maureen have been saying, trying to clear out? What was the experience like?

Well, I personally come from a background which is a great disadvantage to someone who's trying to come to Sahaja Yoga. Because when you come from a Muslim background, you are so heavily conditioned by all kinds of things, especially this idea of deities and statues and all that. It's just out of order. And it's a pity. But fortunately, I had been working on myself, so I did treat myself a little bit before coming to Sahaja Yoga. I started opening up quite a lot.

I think the only major problem I had was some psychosomatic problems, because my mom used to take me to this sorcerer back home to do something—I don't know what she was doing, but I think I got bhooted up by it. And my whole left side was terribly caught up. And Shri Mataji worked on me for months. Without her work, I don't know where I'd be today.

But what is most impressive, I think, is the fact that when you first see Shri Mataji—in my own experience—I said, "She's not a human being." That was the first thing that came to my mind. "She's not a human being. She's something else." And because of my background, I thought of her as a very, very high-caliber saint. But I didn't necessarily realize that she was the Goddess. But very quickly, you do realize that she is the Goddess because she does things that nobody else can do. And she does things that are amazing. She's got so much love that she drowns you in her love in such a way that after a while, you think, "Ah, she is the Goddess. Definitely. She is the Mother. She is the Divine Mother."

And in fact, that was the first thing that I saw. I think Pat and Maureen had written things where they were talking about the Divine Mother. And I remember Pat explaining to me that you have all these chakras and you have a deity at each chakra. And then he said to me, "See, the last chakra is the Sahasrara, and the deity is Shri Mataji." And then I thought, "Oh, that's interesting. That means Shri Mataji is a deity." At least to begin with. Then you start to evolve and you start to basically recognize who Shri Mataji is, very gradually.

But still, those were the beginnings, and we were such a small group that you wondered really whether... you don't have that capacity by which you recognize who Shri Mataji is, even if in the background of your brain there's something that's telling you that Shri Mataji is far, far more than just a deity. But when you meet Shri Mataji the first time, you think, "God, she's so unique. She's so unique." And that's what actually pins you, I think. Shri Mataji didn't need to do anymore to pin my kundalini up. It was already there. It was finished. Because from the moment you see her face, you just know there's something. Shri Mataji is really unique, absolutely unique.

I guess it was different for me as well. I came from a background where we were all goody-goody little boys. And as I mentioned, at around 14, I started seeking consciously. And fortunately, I found a book which made me realize that you need a discipline and control and all that. So when I came, I was relatively undamaged, except for reading furiously and devouring all books on seeking and whatnot. And as I mentioned, the year before, Mother had raised my Kundalini by remote control. So when I came, she said I'd got it. She said, "Oh, he's got it. He's got it." And I felt nothing.

But the Agnya, obviously, was the one that was blocked that she had to work on. And when she cleared that, it was just phenomenal. Besides first feeling the cool and going back into that blissful state which I had the year before in '76, I think six months later, as I mentioned, I had that powerful experience in a follow-up meeting at Caxton Hall. Amazing. Where I just completely... I mean, Mother said it was enlightenment when I talked to her privately the following week. And I was in that state for three days and nights.

And what was that state like?

There was no separation. All of this is a complete imagination. The closest you can relate it to is an exotic computer program. And the program has just created it for entertainment. And we are... you can't describe it. But like I gave that poem that Kabir wrote, there's really nothing. All the mantras and all the stuff we do, it's just part of that place she has created. But it is necessary for those who are seeking and coming to that stage.

So I basically experienced the energy force or entity, part of which was manifesting in this human body. And there was no going back after that. And that's when Mother asked me to come and stay at her house, and I was there practically every weekend. And so, despite the trials and tribulations of life during those early years in Sahaj, as the yogis said, nothing can change that fact. It's like, on a very low, material level, if you know who your mother is—your biological mother—you have the birth certificate, you have the proof, and all that, with a million witnesses. And if she did strange things or asked you to do strange things, it would never change the fact that she was your mother, right?

And similarly, this divine entity decides that in this program, you have to have multiple hip surgeries or you have to suffer life in different ways. There's nothing you can do about it. Because it's the one that's created it. It's your source. You came from it, and it's your final destination. And in between, you occasionally meet the destination and then you're cast back onto this planet because she wants to experiment, to work. And we are part of the little players, or whatever you're going to call us. We have to just continue doing what little we can to continue what she came on Earth for.

Tell us something more... it's really far too deep what you're saying. So thanks for sharing that. But we go back to Shri Mataji's physical form, which is why we have this interview. Tell us about those times.

I was actually reluctant to come on these things right at the beginning because I said, "Let them all meditate."

I know what you mean. Yes. Because I personally, despite all these wonderful experiences, enjoyed listening to these yogis. I just felt the vibrations, and it brought back all those beautiful memories. And I should make it clear, although they looked like a motley crew when I first saw them, there was just so much... I can't think of a better word than love, and compassion, and energy flowing from all of them who were there.

And before going to Mother's physical form, I have to tell you about my first meeting with Pat. It was at that follow-up where he brought me a foot soak bowl. And after that, I went to Finchley Ashram. Two guys had an ashram in Finchley. And prior to that, the mantras and all were kind of new at that time, '77. And I remember they used to sing this... I had no clue what that was. And I think it was Maureen who wrote the words of the Aarti for me. And I can now confess to all the new yogis, it took me two years before I learned the Aarti. It was just alien. It's not my language. I grew up speaking English and the local language of Singapore, which is Malay.

And Maureen also gave me a list of the names of the deities. And we just had seven, very simple ones. None of the left and right and all that. The first time I met them was in Finchley. I remember staying there. It was very interesting. I slept next to a yogi who had a necktie tied around his head. And I remember asking him the next morning, and he said, "Oh, it's my chakra, it's hurting."

And one morning, Jamal wasn't staying there at that time, but I went down for morning meditation, and the yogis had come down. I saw a sleeping bag there. And when they started the meditation, suddenly these hands came out of the sleeping bag towards the photograph. And that was the first time I met Jamal.

I have to remind people that Shri Mataji gave special instructions to the yogis to let me sleep in the morning.

Talking about the confession of Bala, he doesn't need to confess that to me, because once I started reading the names of the thousand... the names of Shri Lalita Devi, he was on the floor with laughter. He said, "What is this?" Do you remember that?

I used to find all this Hindu ritual stuff... I remember that it was alien. I was just wondering what in the world is going on.

This is Finchley, 1977, isn't it?

Yeah. The Call of the Valley was the staple because I loved it. The smell of the dirty, damp carpet, and then the incense, and then the Call of the Valley. Those are the memories one has.

We were all convinced that in 10 years, Sahaja Yoga would be all over the world. The thought that the seekers would be so idiotic and difficult, that hadn't occurred to us. We thought that we'd just go out, give Realization, everyone would wake up, and it would be a complete transformation. In fact, the following year, I remember Mother announced Satya Yuga.

Yeah, 1978. The 8th of April, '78. Wow.

I remember giving out leaflets and telling people, "This is it. The new era is starting. Satya Yuga."

It definitely happened for me because the 8th of April, 1978, was when I had that experience that lasted three days and three nights. Amazing. So it was my Satya Yuga for sure.

And this is the Shri Ganesha statue, Maureen?

It is, yes. That's right. In the heart of the universe, even now. It used to be at her screen.

Tell us about this photo here. This is again at Shri Mataji's house, Ashley Gardens. Funnily enough, it's got very similar wallpaper, hasn't it?

That picture was taken because... long story. I was supposed to be a primary school teacher, and I went for an interview for a primary school teacher. Didn't get it. But it got suggested by a yogi that I should try psychology. So I went for an interview for a psychology course, and it was a whole day interview. And by the end of it, I just felt completely done in.

And it happened that everyone was at Shri Mataji's house, Ashley Gardens. So I went there. When I walked in the room, Shri Mataji looked at me and said, "What on earth have you been doing? Because your vibrations are in such a state." And I thought, "This is the end of my psychology degree." And I said, "I've just been for an interview for a psychology degree." And she said, "Oh, that's fine. Just come here. I'll clear you out. Put your hand on my head." And so she actually got me to put my hand on her Sahasrara to clear me out.

And that is absolutely... sums up how Shri Mataji was then. She is there with a cup of tea, Tony's there, people are eating, but she is still working. She's still working on vibrations while smiling, talking, chatting. Looking after us, and keeping the galaxies whirling as well.

Absolutely. Maureen, I want to ask you, you have your hand on Mother's Sahasrara. I've never seen anyone put their hand on Mother's Sahasrara.

I know. I mean, it was amazing.

Could you put it in words? You've got your left hand towards the window.

My left hand is to the window. You're clearing out the window. And you've got your right hand on Shri Mataji's. What was it like? I mean, were you feeling electricity? It's very hard to put it into words, something tangible that we ordinary yogis, stroke mortals, can relate to. What was it like?

It was like being in touch with an enormous engine. It's the only way I can describe it. You just felt like you were plugged in.

And she would move her skull beneath your hand.

She always did that. And you just would feel literally like you were attached to a divine instrument. It's the only way I can describe it.

You remember when she used to ask us to put our hands on both sides of her head and press really, really, really hard? And she would say, "Go harder, harder, harder."

And one day she asked me, she looked at me, she said, "You have to put all your Arab force into it."

It was similar to putting your head on her feet and your hands underneath her feet. You literally felt like you were plugged into the divine machine. Which you literally were. And she would move her feet and press down, and they were so soft and so strong. Wow.

And this is 1978. So this must be about...

'78. Yes. '78. Because I started the course in October '78.

One day, you know, Maureen, I don't know if you remember. Were you there when we were talking to Shri Mataji, and Tony was saying that if you look at the muscles of her arms and the muscles of her legs and feet, that she's extremely powerful? Because they're harmoniously powerful. It's not like people doing muscle building. And I said to Mother, "But Shri Mataji, your muscles are extremely powerful." I said, "You know, you could just cut someone's head just with your hand." And she said, "Well, I can't do that. I can do it, but I'd be left with half a yogi."

Amazing. Okay, apologies, the photos are not in chronology. Please do share the story that you remember here with the date and the place, if you can.

This one? Oh, okay. This is when we went to India in 1977, January to March. So that's me, Gregoire, Tony, Dougie, and I think it is Pej. Yes. But this was where the sleeping Vishnu was, wasn't it? There is a picture from another angle where you can see the sleeping Vishnu and Mother coming back from offering something to the statue. A statue of Shri Vishnu that was discovered. It had been in the ground, and they discovered it. I think it was in Nepal, wasn't it? Or on the way back.

What did it feel like? I mean, you're having a foot soak over there.

Well, we just took the opportunity as there was water, which seems a bit strange. You've got sleeping Vishnu... Those three months were just like a waking dream, weren't they?

Oh, they were incredible. It seemed to go on forever.

Oh, this is back again to before we went to India. This is Silbury Hill, possibly.

You had to cover your head when you go out in the sun. Do you still do it?

Yes, absolutely. Gosh. Mother said that the brain is made of fat, and if you go in the sun, it melts it and you go mad.

Especially if you're English. Because we tend to sit in the sun, because we get so little sun, that when we get it, we sit in it with no hats on. So I can't do that. I really can't.

But she also said if you wear a hat all the time, you lose your hair. So everything in moderation.

This was when we just met Mother. So this would be 1976, definitely. And that's Kevin, Pat's son, and me. I cut my hair and cut off my beard and mustache.

So Kevin was the first child that we learned about being born realized. Because when he came along, he was seven, and Shri Mataji said he was born realized. And he felt everything instantaneously without having to be told about vibrations and chakras. It was our first experience in someone having that knowledge. And in a way, I suppose, if you needed convincing, it was more convincing to see a child at that age just feel the vibrations and be aware of everything. He just would come out with these things. He said, "I think God gave me an extra eye." And then he looked at me one day and he said, "I think you'll be famous after you're dead."

I think he came to save you, Pat. He's a gift from God.

When he came to see Mother at Gavin's place, Kevin, he bought a suitcase full of teddies, do you remember, Pat? And he unpacked them all. And we were a bit embarrassed as to why he'd got this entire suitcase full of teddies. And Mother said, "You see, it's his family." She just used everything that happened to explain stuff to us. Everything. Nothing was an accident.

This is where we went to visit the Ganges in our three months in 1977. And much to the guy's... do you remember, we went out in a boat, Pat? And the guy was horrified that we insisted on going in the water. I was determined to submerse myself in the Ganges.

Maureen, do you realize that I'm the last living person to have witnessed you coming back from India? Because when I saw you, when I first came to Sahaj, I thought, "My God, you looked so radiant." All of you. So much light coming out of you. I was amazed. And that really worked a lot towards encouraging me, because I thought, "My God, you're so radiant. I should be like that." And you had just come back, and you were quite chubby, Maureen, then.

I was. I lost two stone in India, so I must have been very chubby beforehand.

This picture was while we were in India. It was coming up to Shri Mataji's birthday, the 21st of March, and it was a public program. There were the seven of us Westerners, and we were always called "the foreigners." And Shri Mataji was very keen for us to stand up and talk, because she felt it was good for them to see that Western people were following Sahaja Yoga. It helped them to see that it was universal.

A couple of us had stood up and talked, and one of the people had got a talk already, but they'd memorized it. And when they got up to talk, they went completely blank and couldn't speak because they were trying to remember what they'd learned. And I was due to go and speak next. And Shri Mataji called me over and said, "Can you do it?" And I'm there kneeling down and saying, "Please let me, Mother. Please let them let me do it." And I just got up and burbled about how it was all about love. I can remember that much. I was just so desperate to tell these people about Mother and tell them about Sahaja Yoga and how amazing it was for us.

That was our first experience of seeing Shri Mataji treated in the way that she should be. They had a special chair they had made for her. We had an armchair that we didn't even know you had to cover with anything. And they had proper garlands. We had one sandalwood garland that we used all the time. Mother would just decide where she would sit. We had no idea about protocol. We didn't know anything.

This was in Kathmandu in Gregoire's garden, where he was a diplomat at the time. She came there, and we stayed in his house with her. And that's where she first did Ajwan, wasn't it, Pat? She got us to do Ajwan, and she got her own shawl and she put it over our heads, and we all had to inhale the Ajwan from underneath it. The Ajwan was burning on the coals. And that was when she told us that you must cover your head afterwards and not go out. After Ajwan, you shouldn't go outdoors at all.

This is back in Varanasi. Or Fatehpur Sikri, looking out across to the Taj Mahal. Mother made sure that we got to go and visit important sites in India while we were there for the three months. She used to send us off. We'd go somewhere with Mother, and then she'd say, "Okay, well, I'll see you in a couple of weeks here or there. I recommend you travel and visit this, that, and the other on the way." We got to go to a lot of amazing places, which was incredible. And we all stayed with yogis, which was wonderful. The hospitality was incredible.

We stayed with Rao Bai, with her son who we always called Farmer Rao. He taught us Marathi as well. They had cows, and they used to make us chai with no water. And I got ill. I remember they took me to the doctor, and I was sitting in the back of the car looking at my hands, and they looked gigantic because I was delirious. So I said, "Oh look, I've got Mickey Mouse hands." And then I could see this exaggerated image of their eyes looking at me, thinking I'd gone mad.

And for our viewers, this story you're narrating is the emperor imprisoned is Shah Jahan, and the son who'd imprisoned him is Aurangzeb. And you can see in the backdrop the Taj Mahal, the iconic Taj Mahal in Agra. Thanks for that.

I think we've done the photos.

Okay, thanks for joining back again. And in this half of the program, we're going to ask Uncle Bala to share what he thought was the contribution, and Jamal as well. Because we have Pat and Maureen, two of the first seven yogis at that time. What did it look like from your perspective, Uncle Bala and Jamal, when you looked at Pat and Maureen, who'd been there with Shri Mataji since 1975?

I think the most impressive thing I felt at the time, when I interacted with a few yogis who were already established, was that they also were on the trail of Shri Mataji's philosophy, which is that everything was vibrations. They always stressed the feeling of vibrations for everything that we did. And I remember going to her screen, to the house, and Shri Mataji had lots of very beautiful statues of different deities. The very fact that they made me sit and feel the vibrations of all these murtis... I thought it was amazing that you could actually feel vibrations. And this is what makes you stick to Sahaja Yoga, is when you actually begin to use it. To me, it was like a new language. It's the language of the divine, and the way how the divine interacts with you and tells you what is actually going to be really good and what is not. And I have to be grateful to Maureen and Pat and Douglas for this because they showed a way.

And definitely, the fact that because they just came back from an India tour, they probably didn't realize it, but they had a glow on them that I could see very clearly. And even seeing Maureen, you could see that glow of someone who is different from everybody else that I saw around me. I was at university at the time, surrounded by people who drank a lot and just partied a lot. But there, we had people who were, in fact, saints. They had this glow on them, and that makes a lot of difference.

Yeah, so when I came, of course, I think they were so nervous sitting on the stage that they weren't glowing as much as struggling to look saintly. But after I began, I suddenly felt like I just knew them for a long time. I have no idea... I barely even knew their names. And there was this unbelievable generosity of trying to share the experience with me, which was so unusual. Like I said, Maureen gave me mantras, and I still remember I'd gone to Birmingham a month or two later and then came back to London, and I remember telephoning Finchley and talking to Maureen. And it was uncanny. I just felt this rush up my back, which is obviously the kundalini. I was going, "What? Just talking to one of them produced this effect."

And then there was Douglas, who was quite interesting because he's kind of a simple, unassuming guy. But I had this blocked nose right at the beginning. This was probably late '77. And he started working... doing this funny thing which I didn't know was working on a chakra, and my nose cleared with him sitting there. And I was going, "These people have some capability, right?" Because it wasn't hypnosis or whatever. And that feeling of family was there, which was really unusual.

Well, it was Mother transmitting it through us. But we weren't clear enough to allow the flow of the signal.

We were very keen. We thought, "Great, we're going to transform the world." We couldn't wait to get on with it. But we didn't realize that 50 years later, we'd still be...

Every new person that came, like yourself, and recognized Mother was like everything we'd ever dreamed of. I used to dream of meeting... you knew everyone at that time. And you thought, "Wow, one day I'll meet someone who's got their Realization and I don't know who they are." And now it's happening. Young people, they're all over the place now. But at that time, every one of you that came was like a flower. And we wanted to nurture you. We were just so bowled out that someone at last recognized and understood the way we felt about Mother.

I remember we were together, maybe at Ashley Gardens or somewhere, and Mother looked around very lovingly and she said, "Oh, my first twelve." And then she was talking something about us being at her... now somebody asked, "Where were we before?" And Mother went... she was showing her shoulders. And I thought, "Wow."

I remember that the ladies were allowed to sleep in Mother's room. And I was staying with Mother on weekends prior to that, so I went to Mother and I said, "Why is it only the girls are sleeping?" And she said, "Oh yeah, you can also sleep here." The next thing you know, Gavin wanted to. So then Mother said, "Oh, maybe you shouldn't. You should be with the boys." But it was just family. It was like your mom. Nobody can comprehend that now, especially in the world today, nearly 50 years later. It's just so distorted, people's thinking. They can't understand the relationship between a child and its mother. They have just completely lost it.

And then of course, in Mother's house, everyone used to come there. And what Mother spoke about in her house with me, because maybe after I had that experience, for several days it was just mostly silence or something esoteric. It wasn't even about humans and the world or this material thing, but just about all the other things that you realize when you read Kabir's poems. And that intense love that she awakens in you, that's pouring everywhere. And then she brings you back to earth and says, "Let's go shopping."

This is a hand-drawn Madhubani painting. Was that at Gavin's house?

I think so. Yes, it is. And I think Mother had given it to them.

This was me when I was in my Indian phase. Red Indian phase. I kept going through these different states which would last for days, from past lives. And this was an Indian one. I kept feeling I was an Indian with a headdress and feathers and everything.

There were these two Indian women who came in one time at Dollis Hill, and they wanted to go right in front of Mother. And Mother said, "Tell them not to come to me." Of course, they didn't listen. They went and sat in front, they prostrated before her, and then as they straightened up to sit up, they both fell backwards. I don't know if you guys were there. And she said, "Oh, they are possessed."

So she sent somebody to go and get some limes to clear them up. I was terrified. I didn't know about getting possessed and all that stuff. So she works on them with the limes, and Mother said, "Oh, I've taken the bhoots out into the limes." And then she asked someone to bring a knife to cut the limes so they could be flushed down the toilet. And then she passed the limes to me. These kinds of things used to scare me.

What did you do with the limes then?

You flush it down the loo, the cut pieces. Otherwise, I think you're supposed to throw it in the river or the sea.

Chelsham Road got completely bunged up with limes because of that. Mystified plumber turned up and pulled about a million limes out of the sewer underneath.

They're very effective, the limes. But better in the river or the sea. The best is the ocean or the river. The really possessed people came later on in Dollis Hill with the TMs. But that's another story, isn't it?

Yes, we'll leave it for another session. Just a couple of photos here.

That looks like Tony's altar to me. He had all of Shri Mataji's hair and all that in that furniture. He was the first one to have a proper altar. None of us had one.

I took that picture of Mother on the right, sitting on the chair in her screen. Shri Mataji actually commented on that once. Because I told her about what Tony was doing and how he was storing all these things in this furniture. She said, "God, is he going to open a museum about me?"

It's so funny. How did he know so much about Mother then?

He was with Mother for about a year before everyone else came. So he got very intense one-to-one.

It's getting very late for Jamal particularly.

I do, and I hope the yogis who watch all this understand that they have given me the freedom, they've taken the time out from their revision. So must give the due credit.

First of all, thank you for making this interview happen after quite a few events and delays. So thank you so much, Uncle Bala, for joining us from America. Thank you so much, Jamal, for joining us from France. And Maureen and Pat, thank you so much for joining us from the heart of the universe in England.

Jai Shri Mataji.

Thank you for organizing. Thank you for sharing those beautiful memories of Shri Mataji.

And again, please remind everybody just to sit in that silence with Mother. Absolutely so important.

Thank you. Jai Shri Mataji.
