Yes, it was indeed. It was more intense at that time, wasn't it? How would you say your days were like? What was it, those times with Mother, those very early days?

We'd go for the weekend or for the day to visit her in Oxted—or Hurst Blue, rather—or she would come to Gavin's flat. It all went into a blur. It was very intense, always a lot of fun, but very profound.

The very first weekend that we were invited to Mother's, that I was there—maybe you'd been before—Pat didn't make it, unfortunately. I got lost; I never made it to the station. A temporary hiccup in my evolution. And there were lots of us there. You were there, and Cooley and Gavin and Jane and people.

The day went that Mother would talk to us first, and we'd all be sat there, and you'd smell that they'd started cooking downstairs—and they always started at least three hours before the mealtime. We'd all be thinking, "Oh, that smells good," and then trying to concentrate. "I wonder when dinner is." You'd have this battle between your subtle and your very boring self. And Mother would talk about things and work on people. She was always working on one or the other of us.

And I got sick. I felt tremendous, I felt really good, but I had to keep going off and being sick. She'd work on me a bit more, and she oiled my head for ages and ages. She said, "This will work it out, this will work it out." And she said, "Tonight you'll come with me in the night."

And I thought, "Oh God." I was terrified. Because I was sure that she didn't need to be in her body if she wasn't in front of us. I don't know where I got this idea from, but it just didn't seem necessary to her. So I thought she'd disappear in the night, you see. So I was really scared to be alone with her.

There was a great big living room downstairs, and there was a more intimate sort of sitting room upstairs. We were all downstairs in a big hall, open-plan downstairs, going up to a mezzanine area. And I tried to hide behind someone when she was going up to bed. She got up these stairs and said, "Maureen, come with me."

And she took me, and I hadn't actually got proper nice nightwear. So she gave me a petticoat and a cardigan, everything. And all night long she worked on my back. She would put her hand somewhere on my back and snore. Then she'd stop snoring and say, "Hah!" and I'd have to get up and be sick. I had to go. "I feel sick again." "Okay, off you go." And then I'd lie down, and she'd work, and she'd snore again. And then, "Hah," and off I'd go again. That was the whole night. But I felt fantastic all the time. It was a real looking at the physical as something that just had to work out. And that's what she did. Even all night she'd work on us.

We'd go in the kitchen, and she would cook dal or biryani or something, wouldn't she? It was all on a very high level, wasn't it? Yes, ever so. It was so intense.

Remind us, which year was this?

We were only with her a short time, and she left us. She went to India for six months. She always went to India for the Christmas time, those months. The first puja we did was there. Yes, yes. Do you remember? There was a pujari called Satpal. Yes, Satpal. Do you remember? Apparently, he's just resurfaced. Derek Ferguson found him. He couldn't understand it. He said to Shri Mataji, "Why do these people seem to be getting somewhere, and I don't?" And it's because he would only come to be the pujari. He wasn't seeking, you see.

We had a puja there. I can't remember what particular puja it was, but he conducted the puja. And if I remember rightly, the puja went on for two days. It went on a terrifically long time. Well, it was all like a puja, I suppose. But he used to give us a long talk beforehand, which was really boring. And I remember once I caught Shri Mataji's eye, and she looked bored as well. But he used to give this long talk, and then he'd do the puja. But actually, we did puja before that. We did simple, informal ones to Mother upstairs.

What was a simple puja like?

Just a bowl of water, where Mother would put her feet, and we'd put the swastika on and just wash her feet. We'd have the betel nut. And the little figure of Shirdi Sai Baba—she had a little silver one. Last year, at Navratri Puja, I got to help clean the silver, and some of it was a bit sticky. I said, "Can I clean it?" And Anthony said, "Oh, go on then." And I took the whole thing out, and I found the little Shirdi Sai Baba. The dish with the chain, with the jewels on it, and all the little dish with the jewels—it's all still there.

And the leaf, where Mother showed us how to make kohl for your eyes... It's a silver leaf, and you burn the camphor and you take the soot onto the silver, and then you mix it with ghee. She said, "This is how you do it."

What oil were you burning there?

It was just camphor. You just lit a piece of camphor.

But those pujas with Satpal took place when Mother had come back, the following year, in '76. Yes, that was a different level, a bit more formal. It was a whole six months or so with Satpal, and all those pujas, and all sorts of incredible things went on.

They played the music from an LP. Oh, yes. There was an Indian film that was out. East Makes West, was it? And there was a girl on the front in a miniskirt with a cigarette and a glass of wine. And one of the tracks on it was the aarti. The Shri Ganesha aarti... No, it was the... We used to solemnly take that out, put it on, and then clap as it played. That's the way we did the puja. The interesting thing is the music was the same as the regular aarti music, isn't it? Yes, it was.
