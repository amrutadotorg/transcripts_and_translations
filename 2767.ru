Eleven Rudras
Mahashivaratri Puja
New Delhi (Индия)
First of all I will speak in Hindi language, and then in English.  We have such a cosmopolitan people that I do not know which language to take to.

Translation from Hindi

Today we are going to do the Puja of Shri Shiva.  The form of Shiva within us, is verily the reflection of Sadashiva Himself.  This form of Shiva resides in the Heart, at all times, as the Spirit.  Is there, established, immovable and permanent.  But I will not say it is enlightened.  When the Kundalini is awakened, it touches the Spirit, and then the Shiva gets enlightened within us. And that light shines on our nerves. Chaitanya is called Medhe Stithi , means the first light shining in our brain.  For the first time, the union between our Heart and our Brain takes place.  The Yoga.

Under normal circumstances, man’s Buddhi (intelligence) goes in one direction, and  Mann (mind) goes in another direction.  When this Yoga or union takes place, the light which has begun to shine inside the spirit, becomes manifest or apparent, and takes the form of Chaitanya, vibrations, and flows out of the hands and the fontanelle bone area on top of the head.  You have already experienced this.

What you have to know further is, that when this light comes inside us, we realise that slowly, and steadily, our life begins to change, to transform.  Our inside anger and other Shadripus (6 enemies of the soul), gradually start diminishing.  Gradually everything starts working, and faith and reverence gets established in the mind.  In this state of (shraddha) a desire to surrender and relinquish all evil, starts awakening.  Nothing seems to be important any more.  We behold a new aspect of Shri Shiva as an ascetic of the highest order; unconcerned about appearance; no fixed likes or dislikes; hair matted in coils; no consciousness about decorative dress or ornaments; no unnecessary thoughts.  He has given all these concerns to Shri Vishnu; and Himself is a free personality. He wears the skin of a tiger and roams.  His conveyance is Nandi, the Bull, who is not easy to control.  He is not like a horse that can be controlled with reins.  Wherever Nandi decides to go, Shri Shiva allows Himself to be carried.  He is never conscious or concerned with others’ opinions.  What will people say, what will they think.  Because He is completely absorbed in the Self.  He is sitting in His Own contentment.  He is not concerned about the world and its opinion.  He does not care about public opinion. He is sitting, anchored in His own glory.

You must have heard the description of His wedding.  That when He came for His wedding, Shri Vishnu (Who is Parvati’s brother) was embarrassed, that what kind of a bridegroom’s party has arrived to marry My Sister.  How can I get my Sister married to this personality.  But Parvatiji knew that only such a personality could be Her Husband.  A carefree, easy going person (mast-moula).  No formalities about anything.  When a person goes beyond; then for him everything is the same.  He becomes (Chittpadarth) blissful beyond material possessions. Anchored in His Self.   His attention does not stoop to all these things.  This manifestation of Shiva’s personality that we see, makes Him very endearing and enchanting, and proves that all His nature and activities are definitely  of a very special category.

When the light of Shiva falls on a Sahaja Yogi, then his life also begins to transform.  I have seen that, before coming into Sahaj, the people, men and women, used to be very particular about their appearance.  Always well turned out.  The whole attention used to be absorbed in “what shall we wear today; what shall we wear tomorrow”.  And nowadays a new genesis has emerged in the form of beauty parlours and clinics; and fashion salons.  These have mushroomed all over, and women especially, have got entangled in this temptation.

But, the inner cleansing  starts reflecting on the outside in such a beautiful way that all these outward appearances have no meaning.  Even the peace starts settling on us, and the concern for comfort reduces.  Actually the search for comfort, is really a search for comfort of the Spirit.  Just take a look at these people who have come from other countries.  They have come from a very luxurious lifestyle of fancy houses and cars, and other comforts.  But when they  come here they live in any situation, without complaining or feeling discomfort.

But this is not so with our Indian yogis.  Wherever they go, they demand proper bathrooms.  Attached bathrooms!  I don’t know why they have not been able to rise above all this. I am really surprised that in this poor country like ours, even now there are a lot of selfish desires still lingering. It is very surprising.

Sometime ago someone said Shri Mataji let us buy a large plot of land for an Ashram.  Our Indians just don’t want to live in ashrams.  After the ashram was built with a lot of effort and expense, no one was willing to live in it.  I said, “We will pay a salary to someone to come and live here” but no one accepted.

Now, in My birthplace which is in Chhindwara, so much money and effort was spent to develop it.  I suggested that some retired yogis can live there, because the environment and air is very clean, as it is a hill station;  but there also no one was willing to live.  Everyone is only worried about their own comfort.  But look at these people.  This problem does not exist with them.  They happily live in ashrams.  “My house; my land; my family; my wife, only this kind of food is to be cooked; we will only eat this kind of food”!  We are addicted to the taste of food.  This is not the case with them.  They even eat our Indian food with great relish.  But I am fully aware that when Indians come to Cabella, they pack and bring chapattis, parathas, and pickles and snacks.  Otherwise food will not pass through their tongues.  The whole attention is still attached to the tongue and taste.

So, inspite of meditation, if these habits don’t leave us, you cannot rise above Dharma.  One thing we have to recognise, that even in surrender, we fall short.  This time when we bought land, these people said, Shri Mataji, a lot of money has been spent, so why not raise the puja samarpan.  God knows how many letters poured in, begging Me to reduce the puja money, reduce the puja money, reduce the puja money.

Such a puja happens only once in a year in Delhi, and still the begging. “ My husband will pay, but please excuse me, I cannot pay”.  These same people will spend on paan (betel leaf) and spit it.  It is important to pay puja samarpan.  I have made all the arrangements at My own expense.  I have never asked for help.  But just by raising the puja money, the puja pandal (marquee) is half empty.  Why. Because they do not want to pay money for the puja.  They will telephone and say “please excuse us from paying puja samarpan”, and not because they do not have proper jobs, or they are not earning.  My husband will pay, but I cannot pay.  This astonishes Me a lot.

Now if you had a false guru, he would have shaved your heads, divested you of all your possessions and dressed you in a single saffron dress, and made you stand on your head on the road.  But I don’t do these things.  Because it is a matter of Sahaj.  Everything should happen in a Sahaja way.

I have seen many people practising renunciation in their lives.  But nowadays we cannot find such people.  I know about My mother.  She used to have only six sarees.  If she got a seventh saree, she would immediately give away one.

Even when people come there, to Cabella, it is surprising that they all want separate rooms, or separate houses.  They cannot live collectively with others.  Those who cannot live in collectivity, are not Sahaja Yogis. He is a Sahaja Yogi only in name.  He still thinks he is a great or special person, and special arrangements should be made for him.  Such a person cannot be a Sahaja Yogi.  He is a Sahaja Yogi only in name.

The person who is a devotee of Shankarji, should be like Shankarji.  Make Him sit anywhere, make Him sleep anywhere.  Give Him anything to eat.  He is not bothered.  He is not tied to His watch.  He is beyond time.  He has no demands.  This is the kind of personality He is.  As a Sahaja Yogi should be.

In other organisations, even before something is achieved, strange things happen.  They pull out your hair, snatch everything that you have, and leave you high and dry.  But this is not so in Sahaja Yoga.  But these tendencies must be given up.  We should strive to see what all bad habits we can give up, and get rid of.  Until and unless this fervour comes within us, we cannot become a bhakt (devotee) of Shri Shiva.

Now in the case of Shri Mataji, there are all varieties of bhaktas.  It is not deemed necessary to have distinctive qualities or traits.  All kinds of devotees are there.  After all She is Mother, and She will forgive.  But by getting forgiveness, you cannot achieve that state.  As far as forgiveness goes,  Shiva is a person you should ask for forgiveness.  Every morning we should ask Him for forgiveness.  Because at every step we are always doing things that we shouldn’t be doing.  We should really beg him, that O Shambho, Please forgive us.  We keep making this mistake, and that mistake; and within us all kinds of desires and requirements arise – I want this, and I need that, and so on.  All the time wanting.  As long as these wants are within us, we should keep asking for forgiveness.

And also, “this is mine.  This house is mine.  This is my wife”.  All kinds of feelings of ownership and possessiveness.  Until we get rid of all this, we cannot become devotees of Shri Shiva.

In these matters it is surprising that people of other countries have achieved mastery over their wants and desires.  Those who have never heard the name of Shiva.  Whereas we are still stuck in the mire of outwardly  worshipping Shiva.  It is universally known that if we are to worship Shri Shiva in our hearts, we have to renounce all anger, hatred and corruption.  But the human being, even after coming into Sahaja Yoga, is not able to introspect and see himself.

I have heard that there is a mother-in-law who is troubling her daughter-in-law.  When I asked her why she was doing this she blankly said “I have never ever troubled my daughter-in-law”. When these same people go for a movie and see the mother-in-law torturing the daughter-in-law, they will shed tears.  And then they come home and torture the daughter-in-law.  Or the daughter-in-law ill treats the mother-in-law.  But they will glibly say “We have never ever troubled anyone”.   This kind of screen if you harbour in your mind, you cannot ascend in Sahaj.

Because  Sahaj changes your whole life. It refines you into gold which cannot be tarnished.  Nothing can smother it.  That is what you have become.  So you must attain that state.  Then why this slavery to worldly attachments.  This is the trait or distinguishing feature of Kundalini, that it completely cleanses you in every way.

Seva (worship or homage).  Yes, you must do seva also; But I do not want seva of any kind from you.  I am Mast Moula (engrossed, or in joy, within Myself).  So what seva can you give Me.  Only thing is, you must bring this divine Mast Moula state within your Self.  When you see that you can be  in this state of joy without any effort, then why do we need to indulge into worldly enticements.

After giving a lot of thought, I have reached the conclusion that Sahaja Yoga is very easy, and because of that it is very difficult to follow.  If one takes a rod in the hand and orders – that you shave your head; wear saffron cloth; fast for many days, then it works.  But in Sahaja Yoga it has to be out of pure desire that one embraces a way of life which is pure and holy.  It is a system where we willingly introspect to find out what is wrong within us, and get rid of bad habits to purify ourselves.  And you will realise that you are (Samarth) self sufficient and complete.

The most surprising thing is that once Param Chaitanya knows that you are desireless, with no more wants and requirements, it will, on its own, serve up everything on a platter, without your asking.  Thus it will demonstrate to you that there is nothing that it cannot provide, as and when required.  We just need to have complete faith and surrender.

You have so earnestly and lovingly invited (avahan) Shri Shiva, that He cannot refuse.  He likes such genuine people.  The difference between Him and Me is that I like all kinds of devotees; but He does not.  He only likes those who have got rid of all their attachments and outward show.  We have all kinds of hang ups, like what kind of clothes shall we wear for the puja.  If you don’t have fine and fancy clothes what will happen?  Nothing!

This “sanyasi” saffron dress is only an outward show of renunciation.  The real renunciation should come from within.  Once you are completely detached and surrendered from within, then where you go, how you go, what you wear – nothing is important.  You are absorbed into your self.

In past times there were Naths (members of the sect of Gorakhnath).  They used to travel extensively; and preach and teach spirituality.  I was surprised to see how far they had been able to travel.  When I went to Colombia I learned that they had travelled to Bolivia also.  Now if you go to Colombia in an aircraft you feel giddy with the altitude; and in those days travelling was all done on foot.  So it is impossible to figure out how they reached such a far away place, at such a high altitude.  Even in certain parts of Russia and its surrounding places they had been preaching.  And no one knows where they lived, how they lived, what they wore in those cold places; and what they ate.  When one reaches such a height in spirituality, then you become a super human being.

Like Sainath of Shirdi.  He would go anywhere; he would be seen in all places helping people in trouble.  Some people have actually met him.  Yes, some people can actually see him in person.  Such people become (Amar) immortal and can be seen eternally.  Because all the destructible mortal things in them, fall off; and there is nothing left that can be destroyed.  They become indestructible.  And this is the state one achieves when worshiping Shri Shiva.

English Talk

I am talking to them about Shiva’s worship – what should happen to you. But today, I am going to tell you about the internal happening within us when you get your Realization. There are eleven rudras placed here – eleven rudras. They are particles, we can say, anshas, they call it, of Shiva’s powers, and all of them try to take out or to remove all the false ideas we have about life. When the Kundalini rises, they all get enlightened, eleven of them. And say, for example, Buddha had a part of that, Mahavira had a part of that.

Now, all of them what they do is to control us from falling into the prey of various things, like we have an ego. So, Buddha will look after the ego part. He will see that you get shocked by your ego. You will be quite amazed how you could be so egoistical, and so insulting, and so humiliating. But when this rudra is not awakened, when there is no light in this rudra, then what happens? You start justifying yourself. You think whatever you do is correct, whatever you’ve done, whatever you’ve said, whatever you have achieved, you think is your right. You’ve done nothing wrong. For that, this Buddha’s rudra has to be awakened.

On the contrary, if you go on pampering your ego, if you go on becoming egoistical, you become absolutely a right-sided personality. Once you are a right-sided personality, you will know what all the symptoms there are of such a person. Now, for that if you just watch and introspect and see for yourself what ego has done to you, what wrong ideas you had about yourself. So that’s why Mohammed Sahib has said, “Beat yourself with shoes.” He didn’t know what else to tell. Because this ego business can really burst you, your head completely, and you may land up into so many difficulties.

Ultimately, I have seen people developing this yuppie’s disease where the conscious mind becomes absolutely useless, cannot move.  Consciously, people cannot move. Unconsciously they will, but not consciously. And this disease is so horrible. A person becomes like a reptile. You have to carry them on your body. They can’t walk on their own.  They can’t sit on their own. In a very young age, this can happen. This is happening in America also. I have seen two, three cases here, in India also such a thing is happening.

So if you do not try to see your ego and control it, and feel repentant about it. In Sahaja Yoga, there is nothing like repentance, we don’t believe in repentance. Because we believe that you all have got your Realization. You are beyond any mistakes. It’s not true. We have to repent.

There’s a, in English, there is a word – sorry. Sorry for everything, they'll say sorry. Even telephone if you pick up, they say “sorry.” I say, “Sorry, for what?” But this sorry itself is very empty.  It has no meaning. It has no depth.  When you say “sorry”, you have to see why you are saying “sorry” and what is to be corrected.

This is a very big problem of today’s generation where people have developed such tremendous ego, because all our economic growth, all our industrial developments, all our big, big organizations, all of them have given us a way that we should all develop our ego. If we don’t develop our ego we will be lost, we are nowhere. And that’s how we start pampering it, and then this right-sided problem starts.

Then, as a reaction, it goes to the left side. Actually, in the head it is on the right side. Here is the right side, ego comes up, so the left rudra is that of Mahavira. So people do things, which are sinful, which are wrong, which are against Shri Ganesha.

Then also there are controlling powers of Mahavira who controls. He says, “You will go to hell. This will happen.” He describes all the hell, all kinds of hell, that you’ll go to hell and you’ll be burnt alive - I don’t know, all kinds of things He describes to frighten you. But that hasn’t helped.

So, people start getting more onto the left side and I should say, through this rudra, when this rudra gets helpless, then a tremendous depression comes in. One feels very depressed.

“Oh God! What a depression I have! I am so sick. I am this thing.” And then, you try to frighten others with your depressions. You show sort of a, what you call, emotional blackmail you do. All kinds of things you will do, and beat your head and do all kinds of things. Could be through ego, could be through this left side problem of the left rudra.

These two rudras are very important because they are directly connected with our left and right sympathetic nervous system. So, is very important to see that you don’t fall a prey to these rudras. These rudras are to be satisfied. So to be normal, at least, look after these two rudras, which are: one is one who controls the ego, and another is self-pity. “I just can’t do it, I’m this, that” and all kinds of depression.

All this works out into physically, also into very serious problems like cancer. If the rudras are caught up, you develop cancer. But all this portion gets swollen up. It’s called as the medha. This all portion gets swollen up and you can see a cancer patient having a swelling all over. At least would be here or may be there. Because such a swing in the nature of a person that you can’t say from which rudra they have developed these psychosomatic troubles.

Psychosomatic troubles, all of them, come because the rudras have become ineffective. It can be due to the depressive nature or oppressive nature. It could be due to many other factors also. But all these factors are nothing but part and parcel of Shri Shiva’s or Sadashiva’s powers. He is the One who is full of karuna - full of compassion. He is the ocean of compassion. If you ask Him forgiveness, He will forgive. Whatever you do, instead of feeling guilty if you ask for forgiveness, then He forgives.

But if you think you, whatever you’ve done is good, you’ve never tortured anybody, you have never made anybody suffer.  Then, it knows.  Shiva knows everything, isn’t it? And, because it knows, it starts giving up. So, there’s a big combination of your will power to be there and the combination of the blessings of Shiva. When the Shiva blesses you, your will power also heightens. But you must have full will power to know that you have to be of a higher level of personality.

He was not at all a mundane guy. I mean, He was... supposing, ask Shiva to go to some party and all that. How will He look there? People will laugh at Him. When I met some hippies, I said, “Why are you having this kind of hair?” So they said, “We want to...” They are all primitive. So he said, “I want to be primitive.” I said, “But the brain is modern. What’s the use of having primitive hair?”

So, deception! Deceiving yourself is not going to help. Best thing is to face yourself and understand what wrong you have been doing. If it works out, I tell you, so many sahaja yogis you are sitting here. If you correct yourself and become that, I am sure, all the problems – political, economic – and all stupid problems we have, will be finished. But today it’s such a mixture, due to Kali Yuga, that even the worst people are carrying on.

Now, we have a responsibility to save this world. We have a responsibility to create a great, honourable life, which is not superficial, which is not just to show off. But inside, it should develop so that this light of your Spirit spreads and enlightens this world. It’s very important to understand. All these troubles and, I should say, diseases, psychosomatic diseases, and all other problems, which are- in a collective way we can call - of the Kali Yuga, like political, economic, all these problems only are created by human beings. They are not created by the Divine Force. But Divine Force tries to neutralize them, if there are many Sahaja Yogis, who are practicing Sahaja Yoga in the real sense of the word. If that could be done, if that could be achieved, then I think, we can do a lot – a lot for the betterment of humanity, and that’s why we have got Realization. It’s not only for yourself, it’s not only for your family, it’s not only for your city or country, but for the whole world Sahaja Yoga is going to work out.

Now, if you have to do competition, you must only do competition in your ascent and in nothing else. But people are so superficial, that they think by showing off or by becoming something – a big Johnny – they will achieve something of a very great level. It has to be a very humble attitude towards yourself also, so that you understand that whatever you are doing is for the betterment of global problems.

Absolutely, we can solve because you are the channels of the Divine. If I could do it alone, I would have done it. But I can’t. So, that’s why I had to gather you all and to tell you that you become all the channels. But in the meanwhile, you enjoy, you enjoy life, every second becomes a joy, which is also the gift of Shiva. Shiva is the One who creates this great admiration and great appreciation of every moment, everything that is there.

And, that is the state we have to achieve by not condemning yourself or not by pampering your ego, but by seeing what you are. That’s the main thing one has to see – what problem you have and what is troubling you is yourself. If you could just come to that point of understanding, I am sure - I am very, very sure that you will be such an asset to help to make this world look at itself and change; because superficially you cannot change such deep rooted problems. And, you are being so blessed by Kundalini, that you can really become a great torch, I should say, torch on the path of truth, love and joy.

May God bless you!
