Okay, before we start, can we give a collective bandhan?

Caroline, thank you for asking me again to come. Like I said before, I'm not a great speaker, but I'll try my best. Also, I hope that whatever I share with you will be pleasing to Shri Mataji and Her divinity, because we're all yogis, we're all connected to Her. We are yogis because of Her, because of Her blessings. So I hope that whatever I share will be pleasing to Her, and that you all will find it inspiring.

Many of the things that I'm going to speak about... First, I'm going to talk about these three incredible miracles, because they are incredible. And then I'm going to just speak a little bit about the many of the different public programs that we have. I just wanted to let you know that these public programs were not just me. Some of them I did organize, but most of them—actually, all of them—had the contribution of so many wonderful yogis from America and from Europe. So we'll discuss that later.

But I wanted to start with the miracles, because I think that you will all be astounded at these. The one that I was really going to share the last time I started, we never have enough time. And by the way, Caroline, whenever I'm getting too long, just let me know. I'll shorten whatever I'm saying because I don't want to go overboard. And also, you guys can ask questions, you can cut in. You don't have to be silent if you have any questions about anything. Just speak up.

So, three beautiful things that I think you guys will just be astounded at how divine our Mother is. Like I said last time, I always wanted to know, who is God? What is God? What kind of state is it?

The one which I really love—I love all of them—but the one I want to share first was in Los Angeles in 2006. I think it was Guru Puja. We were in L.A. and I sat down for meditation before the puja was going to start. Everybody was sitting down, meditating and getting ready. At a certain point, Vasu came up and said, "I might need you later on because we can't find Dorothy." Dorothy is one of our yoginis from Philadelphia, and she was supposed to do something with the gifts and they couldn't find her. So Vasu came up to me and said, "If we can't find Dorothy, can you come and help?" I said, "Of course."

Towards the end of the puja, he did call me and he said, "Come, come up behind the stage." I went behind the stage and there were gifts that had already been given on the stage. There were just a few left and the yogis that were on the stage were already finishing up. So basically, I was just standing there, and I really didn't want to go back. I was going to wait for Shri Mataji to leave so I could just see Her close up.

So I waited, and when they prepared Shri Mataji to leave, they closed the curtain to the stage. I was behind the curtain and was just watching Manoj, the leader at that time, wheeling Shri Mataji down the ramp. As Manoj was coming down, gently pushing the wheelchair, I looked at Shri Mataji and she looked like a little old lady to me. She looked sick. Her head was bent down towards her right side and it was touching her right shoulder, and she looked so tired. As Manoj passed me, I'm looking at Shri Mataji from behind and I see her right shoulder kind of slumped down and her head bent down as if she was really, really tired, but I couldn't see her face. I could just see her body, like very old and very, very tired. To me, she looked like a little old, sick lady.

As I was watching her, I said to myself, "Shri Mataji, you're not this little lady. I know you're not. I know you're not this little old sick lady." Then Manoj pushed Shri Mataji's wheelchair and they left the entrance of the hotel. I was left standing there, still thinking, "I know Mother is not that little old lady."

Right at that moment, I started feeling these incredible vibrations and I had to look up. Something told me to look up, and I looked up at the curtain. The curtains were like a grayish-white, very light gray, almost like off-white. I looked up and I saw these incredible white vibrations. Then what started forming in the vibrations was the face of the Goddess. If you could have seen the face of the Goddess, it was incredible. Shri Mataji's eyes looked into eternity, and She was young. You couldn't put an age on Her, but She was like pure youth, a young woman. Her face was looking into eternity and She was so beautiful. I was just astounded at the image that She presented to me.

Then slowly, slowly, the vibrations kind of dissipated and the image stopped. I started looking down. The vibrations were getting weaker and weaker, and I was so full of surprise and still full of vibrations myself that I wanted to go and talk to somebody and tell them. I saw Jerry Maflow—you might even be listening now—and I went up to him and I'm saying, "Jerry," and I'm going, "blah, blah, blah." I couldn't talk. I could not talk. The experience was so powerful that I just could not talk. Then I tried talking to his father-in-law, attempting again to explain what I just saw, and it just wouldn't come out.

So what I did, I just finally sat down on the floor against the wall, closed my eyes, and just relaxed into what I had just seen. It was just so powerful, and just amazed that Shri Mataji allowed me to experience that. So, Mother is not a little lady. We know She's the Adi Shakti, but to what extent... She really gave me such a blessing that time. Whenever we think of Mother in Her human form, it's just maya. It's all illusion. And hopefully one day we will see the full picture.

Another miracle, which I really wanted to share with you, was when Mother left Her holy body. I went to Cabella, and there were many yogis there, probably about three or four hundred. We were waiting for the yogis from Genoa to bring down Shri Mataji's holy body. As the car arrived—the first car, of course, was Mother's—it opened up and Sir C.P. came out from the front. Then the yogis took the coffin out of the car. There were about eight yogis that started bringing Shri Mataji upstairs towards Cabella, towards her apartment.

As I'm looking up and as they're bringing Her up the stairs very, very slowly, very carefully, what came into my mind was all of the past experiences I had experienced during my time with Her physical body. And me, just like everybody else, we were all so emotional, and I just started crying. Then I said to myself, as I was looking up at the yogis carrying the coffin, "Mother, was I worthy of you?" Just like everybody else, we were all so emotional. And I said, "Mother, I hope I was worthy of you, and I hope that I didn't make any mistakes. I know I made mistakes. But I just hope that I didn't neglect my family and I didn't neglect anything that you wanted me to do." And so I said, "Mother, did I do everything that you wanted me to do? Did I behave well with my family?" Because many times, I would just go to programs and leave my family alone. I was thinking back and I just kind of felt guilty. But it was Mother's work and I had to do it.

They were almost reaching the top of the stairs into the salon, and then I started feeling... I thought I felt a fly here on my forehead, on the right side of my forehead. I thought I felt a fly and I'm going like this. And then again, I started feeling this tingling. And then I heard Shri Mataji's voice, and She just said very gently, "Yes."

We were all in a state of sadness. The emotions were very, very high, very deep, and I guess my emotions were like that also. But I just wanted to tell Shri Mataji that I just hoped She was pleased with me. And then I finally heard her voice, just on the side of my head, on the right side. I heard such a sweet, gentle "yes." And then everything just released. Not that at the moment where you're watching Shri Mataji's last moments on earth in the coffin, anything gets released. But I was just so content that the fact that I had sometimes neglected my son, my family, my husband... that kind of put me at ease. So anyway, Mother knows everything. She knows everything. And like She always says, if our desire is pure, She will manifest that.

The last miracle that I wanted to share was from the beginning. It was 1989, actually. I was going through a pretty bad divorce and I was really going to leave New York. I was in such a state of turmoil. I mean, I loved my husband, but I had to divorce, otherwise it would have affected me too much. It was already affecting me, and I knew I had to cut it. I didn't want to, but I had to.

So I left New York and I was making my way to Ohio because my family was there. My heart was almost bursting out of my chest because everything was so heavy, so tense, and I knew I was going through a really, really bad time. I took the bus. I was waiting in line for the bus to take me to Cleveland and I had like three or four suitcases with me. I'm pushing them one by one, and then all of a sudden I hear this... like some kind of a wind. I had no idea where it came from. I looked around, I didn't see anything. There were just people in front of me that were waiting to get on the bus, but I didn't see anything. So I said, well, it could have been the wind or something.

Then I went to get my suitcases and I hear a voice, a male voice, and he said, "Can I help you?" I looked around and I see this man. He looked okay. He didn't look mean or violent or anything. "Yeah, sure," because I had three or four suitcases. So I took one or two suitcases and he's picking up the others, and we're slowly, slowly moving. He said to me, "Are you going to Phoenix?" "No, I'm not. I'm going to Cleveland. You see the sign up there."

The line is moving towards getting on the bus, so we moved the suitcases up a little bit forward. And then he said, "Are you going to Los Angeles?" "What? I'm not going to Los Angeles. I told you I'm going to Cleveland."

Then we reached almost the front where the conductor was taking the tickets. We're right in front of him. I don't know what happened to this person... the way he looked, he was blond. He was kind of stocky. He wasn't tall, but he was stocky and he was round and he was blondish. He was kind of a little bit bald up here, but his hair was blond, and he was just very stocky and had some kind of a white shirt on. But before we reached the conductor, once more, he said to me, "Are you going to Los Angeles?" And I said, "No, I told you I'm going to Cleveland." By this time, I'm thinking, what's going on with this guy? I thought he was just a strange guy and was going to be on the bus and be a pain in the ass. Just forget this guy.

We were by the conductor taking the tickets and I'm going to hand in my ticket, but the man that is following me is next to me and he gives him his ticket. The conductor opens up the ticket, he looks at it and he says, "Hey, there's nothing here." It was just a piece of paper. And at that moment, the man ran away. I'm thinking, what is going on? He just took off. When the conductor opened up his ticket, there was nothing there, and at that moment he just ran so quickly, almost like a cat moves. It turns, and then it disappears. And this is what this man did. I thought, what's going on here?

I had no idea. I got on the bus, and I'm still in that state of emotion because of the divorce and stuff. And then I started feeling so much peace. It was incredible. All of the tension went away. My heart opened up. I started feeling in the state of where I wanted to be, and that was the state of peace, of knowing that everything was going to be fine, that you had to get this divorce. It was needed, otherwise it would not have been good for you to continue.

Then I thought back to that person that helped me with the suitcases. I'm thinking, God, I wonder if maybe She sent him to help me. I was talking to Luisa, and she told me that it could have been some form of William Blake. I don't know. But his body, I still remember distinctively. His body was stocky, very stocky, round, and it was just all in white. And he had this blondish hair. So I think maybe it was some form of a deity that Mother just sent to let me know that everything was going to be fine and that with time, I would feel better.

Thinking about it later, you know, Los Angeles means the City of Angels. So that's all I can think of. Maybe if he was a deity—and I can't say for sure, but it was some form of vibration of hope that Mother sent—and then he said "Phoenix." You know, Phoenix from the Greek mythology is the bird that burns himself so he can be transformed. So that's why I think he said Phoenix, and twice he said L.A., because even Shri Mataji says Los Angeles means the City of Angels. So maybe the journey that I was starting would take me there.

These couple of other things also happened, but I'm just going to stick to these three because they're so special. And to share them with you only gives us a broader picture, a broader knowledge of who our Mother is. She's the Adi Shakti. We're just so blessed. Hopefully, we'll reach home where She wants us to be in our Sahasrara. Remember when She opened up my Sahasrara? This is our goal, our purpose for Her having given us self-realization: to be able to reach Her. I can't stop saying how blessed we are.

So, the programs that we did... Once I felt ready, I started giving public programs. After, I think it was 1987. I got my realization in '83 and as I told you guys already, I was in bad shape when I came to Sahaja Yoga. Really bad shape: left side, right side, all the chakras messed up, back agnya, forget it. But it took me three or four years, just working on myself, going to the programs, going to the pujas. By 1987, I started having the public programs in Jackson Heights in Queens, New York. So until 1990, I did the programs there. And again, I was not by myself. Yogis were coming out that were living in Queens, and many yogis would come also from Brooklyn and Manhattan. So it wasn't just me. That was a learning experience. And then as I got stronger and stronger...

In 1989, the latter part of 1989, I read that they were having programs in prisons in India. I read the report, and I said, "Oh my God, this is fascinating, to give self-realization to prisoners." And that notice just really inspired me. Here in New York, we have Rikers Island. It's probably the biggest prison in America. It's a holding prison. It means that people are there waiting to go to trial. They're not guilty or innocent, but they're waiting to go to trial to find out about their behavior, whether they're going to prison or not.

I did all the paperwork, I contacted people, and we finally got a response. The thing is, at that time, Shri Mataji was coming to New York, and She was giving a program for social workers. So it worked out that I invited the head of one of the men's departments in the prison—it was a medical department, these were prisoners who were ill—and she ran that. I invited her to come to Shri Mataji's program in Manhattan. And she came. She came, and through her—this was even before we started the programs—she came and she met Mother and she had her realization through Mother first, not even through the yogis, but through Mother.

When we started the programs, she was incredible because she had met Mother and she was so enamored and so inspired. She allowed us so many things that usually visitors aren't allowed to do. For the men, we first worked with the men in the medical area where the prisoners needed medical attention. And Maria Gerena, she would allow the prisoners even to footsoak. So they would footsoak, and Stella, one of our yogis, she would even bring sandwiches and they would allow her. We were allowed to do so many things that normally regular visitors were not allowed, so we were given a lot of leeway.

I remember the first program we did. It was me, Stella, I don't know if Jerry was listening, I know that Mary Ann Berman came too. I remember we were waiting for the very first program to start, and then these guys come in from another room and they're in shackles. Their hands are tied and their legs are held in shackles, so they would walk very slowly. And that was such a powerful moment because these guys, you could see they were very poor, they were all ill, they were in a pretty bad state, all of them. There were about 12 to 15 men that came. We had the program and it was just so powerful. The vibrations were very, very heavy, because of the environment, the status of the vibrations of the prisoners. But at the end, when we went through the program—the information, chakras, and then into the self-realization—at the end, everybody got it. It was amazing. And again, Mother's attention was always there.

We did the men's part for about maybe three, four, or five months. Then we went to do programs with the women. And that was amazing because when we went to do the programs with the women, there were about 70 women that came, 65 to 70. They were all ages: they were white, Black, I know there were some Chinese. The majority were Hispanic and Black, but there were also some Caucasian people. The first program we did was amazing because they all paid attention. They were all anxious to meditate, and at the end, everybody got their realization. They all came towards us, they wanted to talk to us. We learned that most of the women were in there because of drug use. Many of them were drug addicts, and as children, they came from broken families. Many of them had been sexually abused, and many of them grew up with alcoholic parents.

One story I want to share about the women's program... We did this for about three months, then we went on with the teenagers. But there was one lady, she was pregnant. Her name was Sophia, she was Greek, and she was almost nine months pregnant. She came to two or three programs, and then we didn't see her anymore. I thought maybe her baby was born. This is amazing, listen to this. Later she came back. She had her baby, a little boy. But she actually took over the program. She started talking to the women. She said, "You guys, this is for real. My baby was born. I was a drug addict. All the doctors in the prison were expecting my child to be born addicted to drugs." She said, "My baby was born very cool. He wasn't addicted, but he was very, very cool. And when he was born, everybody around could feel this cool breeze." Isn't it incredible? She said, "This stuff is good, it's for real." We learned that her baby's name was Richard, so everybody always called him Baby Richard.

Then we stopped these programs because we had to go on with the teens. But a fascinating thing happened. It was me or Andrea Stewart-Cousins—you know she's in politics now. I don't know if she asked me or if I asked her to go to Mother Hale House, which is in Harlem. It's very famous. We both went there with the intention of asking the administration to do Sahaja Yoga programs. And the person that we spoke with, she was telling us the way it's set up. She said, "We also even have a place here for young babies. We even have a baby who came from the prisons." My God. All of a sudden, I started feeling these vibrations, and I said, "Is that Baby Richard?" She said, "Yeah." And he was in the orphanage because his mother went back on drugs. She couldn't take care of him, so the baby was put in the orphanage. But I asked if we could see the baby, but the lady said no, visitors are not allowed to see the babies at all, which, of course, we respected. So that's something that Mother did. We were just vehicles for all of these incredible experiences.

Then we went to the teens. And if Jerry's listening, he came to work with the teens. If the guards had been more committed, they could have brought more teens down to participate. But the guards, they're there for their money. They were decent, but they really didn't commit themselves fully to our programs. As a matter of fact, the programs with the teens lasted two or three times because the guards actually did not want to bring them down. But we did two programs with the teens, and the first one that we did, we learned that all of these teenage boys knew about Tai Chi, they knew about Buddha, they knew about Jesus. They had a lot of information on a religious background, so they were seekers.

It was fascinating because these boys, yeah, they came from poor families, but they were all seekers. At the end of the program... we were talking about the chakras, and there was one boy that kept going back and forth, back and forth. So we got done with the introduction, and we were meditating. This boy finally sat down and he meditated with us. Then, Jerry and I took the incense—we were allowed to use incense—and we were kind of doing bandhans to clear the picture and to show the kids that this is just a clearing mechanism for the environment. The boy that had been walking back and forth, that eventually joined us, he came up to us. And then he took the incense and he started doing the same thing. He started making the bandhans around Mother's picture. And then he said to us, "Does this mean that Shri Mataji forgives me?"

Oh my God, me and Jerry were almost crying. Because he automatically said, "Does this mean that Shri Mataji forgives me?" It was amazing. These kids were amazing, they were all seekers. Unfortunately, the administration didn't pursue more programs because they didn't want to be bothered. We did these programs for almost two years, believe it or not.

Mr. Subramanian, the wonderful musician from India, at one point was in New York. We met, and he wanted to come and hear about our programs. So we got permission for him to come, and he gave a musical program. At the end, the vibrations were so amazing. Mr. Subramanian is such a deep singer and musician. At the end, he always reaches those notes where your Kundalini is up and you're just so fully connected. When we finished, we were just all amazed, we were just in meditation. And these guys that were there, there were about seven or eight of them. This one cute big guy, he was Spanish, he just took Mr. Subramanian—and you know Mr. Subramanian is so small—and he took him and he hugged him. He said, "Man, that was beautiful." It was just amazing.

Another time Andrea came. I think this was when she was starting her political career. She came to one of the programs. I remember it was summertime, and it was so hot. Before we started, I said to the guard, "You know, it's kind of hot, can't you open the windows?" I mean, I didn't think that we were in prison. And the guy looks at me like, "Lady, this is a prison, we can't open the windows." I said, "Oh my God, I forgot." But it was really, really hot. Andrea gave the program and the vibrations were amazing. There were about 12 guys, all fascinated with the yoga, they were all paying attention. Every time Andrea would talk, this little bird would come on the windowsill. It was just amazing. And as Andrea would talk, she would address the bird and say, "Oh okay, you want to participate." It was just beautiful. The men all meditated very deeply. I know that these programs in prisons were amazing. Mother's attention doesn't just go on us, the privileged ones, but Her attention goes on every human being, whether you're rich or poor, Black or white. I knew every time we did these programs, Mother was saving these people.

There was one more story. There was one Hispanic young man, he was about 21, 22. He came to the program and he kept telling us, "I'm innocent. I'm here waiting to go to trial. I've been here like two, three months, and I just hope they find me innocent because I had been in a gang before, but when that particular incident happened, I happened to be near it, but I wasn't involved." It was some kind of a robbery or some pretty bad behavior. But Napoleon, his name was Napoleon, said, "I'm innocent." So we kept telling him, "Napoleon, come to the programs." And he did. We kept telling him, "When you meditate, just ask Mother to guide you. If you are innocent..." His vibrations were very cool, he would meditate all the time. We said, "When you meditate, just ask Mother to help you. She will help you." The week before he had to go to trial, he told us, "I'm not coming back now because I'm going to be going to the trial, so maybe I won't be seeing you." We just gave bandhans that he would be found innocent. Two or three days later, the big headline in the Daily News, a major newspaper here, said that Napoleon had been found innocent in a half hour. Half an hour into the trial, he was released. That's another incredible story. And again, we were only Mother's instruments. Mother's attention goes to everyone.

We did programs at Sukasa, a drug rehab, for three years. The lady that gave us permission to do the programs, she was the director of Sukasa, which is in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. She also met Mother in that program when Shri Mataji came to give realization to social workers. Denise Donovan came also and she met Mother and got her realization through Shri Mataji. That's how we were able to start these drug programs.

The very first program we did, I remember Jerry was there, there were 89 people. 89, all waiting for us. Some of them had old clothes on, some of them had dirty clothes on. You could see on their faces that their life was not good. It was a tense environment because they were all caught up. They were caught up on the left side and the right side, their chakras were all imbalanced, and the environment was really heavy. It was really hard for the meditation. So what we did, we just did the introduction, and then we just spent a lot of time meditating. We just took extra time, longer than usual, because the vibrations were so heavy and so tense. We just meditated a little bit longer with the hopes that the Kundalini would come up. And at the end, they all got it. At the end, something just released, and they all got it. It was amazing. We continued those programs for three years, not consecutively, but there were times when we'd take a week or two weeks off.

When they had the very first Earth Day, we were in Grand Central. As you know, Grand Central is a beautiful, magnificent train station. We organized to have a Sahaj table there for the very first Earth Day celebration. Me and many of the yogis were there, and it was amazing because it was the start of the Earth Day celebration, the attention on Mother Earth, and so many people got their realization. We did street realization for like three years, mostly in the summertime. That was amazing, so many people would just get their realization.

The last thing I wanted to share is about the Native Americans. I had read a book called Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, which if you guys haven't read it, I would suggest that you read it because it's very enlightening for a yogi to realize the depth of what actually happened in this country, the genocide that was created against a very, very innocent race. I read the book in like two days and I was amazed. I finished reading it and I said, "Oh my God, we have so much work to do." This book really gave you the history of the systemic, organized way everything was organized to kill the Indians. It gives you a history of how each of the attacks was committed. They would go into a village at night, they would kill babies, women, they would rape the women—the atrocious things that they would do.

Even with one of the very famous leaders, Black Kettle, this happened in Colorado. It's called the Sand Creek Massacre. When we did the Native American tours, we actually had a havan there at Sand Creek itself. But Black Kettle, it was at night, and he saw the soldiers coming. He immediately raised a white flag because he knew what they were going to do. He said, "I surrender, I surrender, leave my people alone." And the army came in and they killed every man, woman, and child in that village. Something like 150 to 250 innocent people. So this is the kind of karma this country still has to address through Mother.

We decided spontaneously that we were going to go there because we just allowed Mother to work through us. Again, it wasn't just me; there were many European yogis that came too. Shri Mataji even told us that the Native Americans, as a collective, were getting ready to get their self-realization. They were on the verge of becoming a realized collective. I'm getting so many vibrations now. And this Mother told us. And again, look what happened: a genocide. I mean, people say it's two or three million people killed, but some historians place it at least 10 to 15 million innocent people. You can imagine what kind of karma. But again, through Mother, some of it has been alleviated because we did about six or seven Native American programs. We went on the reservations, we gave self-realization, we did a lot of havans. The havans were extremely important to clear the left side because after the genocide occurred, the Native Americans were terribly affected.

Wounded Knee occurred in 1890, and that was the last attempt by the Native Americans to maintain their culture and their way of life. As you know, at Wounded Knee, 290 of them were killed. Luckily, we were there. We actually had two or three havans there. Many yogis from Europe and America, we all prayed at Wounded Knee, and we were even able to put up four huge banners of Mother's picture on the reservations.

The way this started is, I was watching TV one evening, and this Native American man, his name was Richard Iron Cloud, was talking about Pine Ridge. Pine Ridge is a Lakota Sioux reservation. He was on the news program 20/20, talking about the poverty that was there, the suicides, the drug addiction. I said, "Oh my God, why can't I just call him and see if people would like to hear about Sahaja Yoga?" I was able to reach him. But it was Mother's work. It's not me, it's Mother, trust me, because all of this came about because of Her guidance and Her attention on what was needed to save this country. I was able to reach him very easily, by the way. And he said, "Sure, come." He was in South Dakota.

So we organized the programs. The very first program, Janice was there, Brian was there. Through them and through Richard Iron Cloud, we were able to go back four times to Pine Ridge itself. We were able to give realization, though the programs were not heavily attended. There were some Caucasian people, because Caucasian people work on the reservations, but they were mostly Indians. I would say not more than 20 at a program. But the vibrations were always amazing.

We got a lot of people when we did the pow-wows. The pow-wow is a celebration that the Native Americans have with music and dance. It's a celebratory gathering. At the pow-wows, we were able to give a lot of realizations. We were there for the weekend at Pine Ridge, and we gave as many as two or three hundred self-realizations. People would very easily come and sit down. The thing is, the Native Americans, because they were the first citizens of this country, they're the Vishuddhi. Now they're all caught up because of the genocide, but their connection to the Virata, to Lord Krishna, is so great, because they could get realization like that. People would come, they would sit down, their Kundalini would come up. We didn't even have to work. In the regular programs, you'd have to work 20 minutes to a half hour on regular people, remove many obstacles before the Kundalini can come up. With the Native Americans, it was amazing. Their Kundalinis would come up so easily, so quickly, because they were the first citizens of this country and they were so fully connected to Krishna. Unfortunately, because of the genocide, the Vishuddhis are caught up, but the Kundalinis would come up really quickly.

Basically, from 2004 to 2018—then the pandemic came and we had to stop—we had about six or seven Native American tours. During that time, what I saw is the change that is happening in the Native American communities. First of all, two ladies are now part of the Congress in Washington. And a few years ago, Deb Haaland, who is part Swedish and part Pueblo, actually became the Secretary of the Interior. She's now the head of the Department of the Interior, where she's in control and makes the laws regarding the lands in America, the national parks, and so forth. She also started a group for missing and murdered indigenous women because that is something that has been going on for years. They're really bringing a lot of attention to it now and trying to stop the horrible attacks that the Indian women experience on and off the reservations. So since 2004, so many things have happened. The Native Americans are waking up, and this is what Mother needs. They need to come out of the left side. Because of the genocide, they were so horribly damaged that they ended up with drugs, suicides, alcoholism. They didn't even know alcoholism; white people brought the alcohol. White people would put smallpox underneath the beds, just all part of the genocide.

What's happening now on a very positive note is that they're waking up. The movement is there for them to get their rights again. Many of them are voting, many are seeking help for their addictions. I know that because on the reservations, they all have health services. But what's important is that this left side is not fully healed yet. Shri Mataji is slowly, slowly healing it, so that once the American society fully recognizes what they did and they admit to this genocide, then the Virata, then Lord Krishna can be fully awakened. If you listen to Shri Mataji's incredible video, the Virata Puja from 1989, you have to listen to that because this is where Mother addresses all of these issues.

She tells us in this video that because so many Native Americans were killed so viciously and so terribly, they became lost souls. They became confused souls and they were left hanging in the air because they had died so badly that they were lost. This created like a cloud over the American society. So many problems that this country had—the drugs, the alcohol, the guns—stems from this karma. One time I was talking to one of the yogis, he's a lawyer and he was good friends with Gregoire de Kalbermatten. When Gregoire would come to New York, he would go to Jim's house because they were both lawyers. And Jim got Lyme disease. Jim told me that Gregoire told him that Shri Mataji said that Lyme disease is actually the souls of Native Americans that are trying to get their revenge on the white people for taking their land. Isn't that incredible?

The left side still has to clear. What's extremely important, what I feel is extremely important, is that the United States government—the president, the politicians—they have to go in front of the American people and they have to ask for forgiveness from the Native Americans for what was done to them. That has never happened. There has to be a dynamic and powerful truth and reconciliation for the Native Americans, because if that's not done through the American government admitting, "Yes, we did this, we ask for forgiveness," the Virata will not fully open. But on the other hand, the Native Americans have to forgive.

Some of it is there, and to be honest with you, some of it is not. Some are angry, rightfully so. But the majority of the people that I dealt with on the reservations, they're very forgiving. Most of the Native Americans still have a great connection to the earth, whereas most of us don't. All indigenous people—Aboriginals in Australia, Native Americans—they all have a great connection to the earth and the elements, and this makes them forgiving. It's invited in their DNA, even the modern ones.

So we just have to, as yogis, pray and desire that the U.S. government does this truth and reconciliation for the Native Americans, and that the Native Americans also fully forgive. Once that happens, I think the karma will be alleviated in this country. This is what I've learned through the Native American programs.

Question: Is there any plan to start up these meetings again?

The thing is, after the pandemic, everything stopped. When I was in Pine Ridge—I actually stayed in Pine Ridge from 2016 to 2017—I worked as a substitute teacher on the reservation with the children. I did programs there, and every week people would come, but they would come and they would go. Nobody actually stayed on and became yogis.

So right now, there are no programs going on. I'm in the midst of moving, so I have many personal things that I need to address. But what I want to do is try and contact a Native American community here in New York. Once I get settled in my new place, I will try and contact them to see if they want any programs. I did contact them maybe seven or eight years ago for a health fair, and they allowed me to go, but they weren't interested in doing any follow-ups. So what I'm going to do is, once I get my personal stuff out of the way, I'm going to try and see if I can do some programs again, and maybe do another tour. I don't know yet. We have to see where our divine Mother wants us to go. That's the most important thing.

One time, Fabrizio and Cosetta, they came two or three times to the tours. This one man came up to Fabrizio; we were in Pine Ridge. This one Indian came up to him and was asking for money, because many are poor. And Fabrizio, in his broken English, says, "I'm going to give you a gift." This man was older, he was an alcoholic, he was really sick, he was smoking. And Fabrizio said, "Look, I'm going to give you a gift. Hold out your hand." So the man held out his hand, and his Kundalini came up in seconds. Can you imagine that? The man is an alcoholic, he's poor, he didn't have any teeth, you could see that he was physically not well. But his Kundalini came up in seconds. It's amazing how the Native Americans are still so ready. But again, who are we to say who is a yogi and who is not? You become a yogi on your own through Shri Mataji and through Shri Ganesha, and also our desire.

But things now are way, way better than they were 20 years ago. Way better. What I want to do is get a couple of other yogis and write to Deb Haaland. Once I get my stuff out of the way, I want to write to her and see if we can meet with her, because she is such a good person.

Any questions?
