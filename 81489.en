Most of that was pretty hard work and pretty profound, and on a very high level. At one point, I was sitting with Shri Mataji at her dining room table and I suddenly saw that she looked like the primordial mother. I could see this whole array of powers that she had that had all been neatly tied off because she didn't need them. It was a flash, something like that. It was constantly out of this world, the intensity of the whole thing. Another time, she was just playing with a ball of energy somehow. It was like you almost weren't on earth. You were with God all the time.

It even kept us through that six months she was away. We used to meet once a week. We all came from very different backgrounds and had nothing in common. We worked on each other, sort of, or Jane used to work on herself. Yes, we meditated. Somehow it kept us going. I was amazed because I'd stopped taking anything—I'd given up drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, everything. I just kept going somehow. It's like being in a plane that suddenly runs out of fuel and the engine stops and you think, "What's going to happen now?" But it just kept going. I just kept going.

When she came back, she told us off, and said we were all very caught up because we weren't going to India now. She had promised we would go, and we were saving up for it. So I thought, "Oh well, we're not going," and I went and spent all my money on a big stereo system. Then, two weeks later she said, "OK, you're cleared out now. We are going to India." So I had to start saving all over again. I've still got the stereo. Some of it, anyway. I sold part of it to Douglas—that was actually to help pay for your ticket, for your honeymoon.

The rest of that year, 1976, was really spent preparing to go to India, because we went in January 1977. Probably one of the most awesome things that happened during that time was when she took us out into a back garden and washed our feet.

She washed your feet?

Yes. Can you imagine what that feels like? You can't put it into words. It's so humbling, so awesome. You're just horrified and completely... I don't know, what can you say? It's wonderful, but terrible. Really. We stood outside and it was getting dark. She must have taken the name of Shri Vayu, but we didn't know it at that time, and this cool breeze just came and moved around the garden. It was tremendous.

Then we went to Weston-super-Mare, didn't we? We had our first seminar there. It was her niece who had an Indian restaurant in Weston-super-Mare. We were all in such a state. We had a long weekend there, down on the train and back. I remember walking around on the seafront. Shri Mataji would sit on a bench by the path, and we'd all be on the grass on the other side, all taking vibrations. All these people were stopping and having to walk around us, and Shri Mataji would just carry on holding forth. She did the same on the tube. We'd all be on the train, swaying, and she'd still be telling us things and talking to us.

She was always talking... it was all very high-level stuff mostly then, wasn't it? It wasn't to do with the everyday world much. Not at all. It was more to do with where you were at, what your catches were, and the fact of saving the human race. There was little time. It was quite awesome, really, because I'd look around at this lot of battle-scarred Muppets—we looked such a mess—and think, "My God, how can we do anything about all this?" But at the same time, we were having very powerful experiences.

And then we went to India for three months. We thought we'd come back perfect, at least I did. Well, it certainly changed a lot, but it was more about realizing what state we were in. We horrified all the Indian yogis, of course, because we had no idea about spirituality or protocol. They met us off the plane, and my Sahasrara, which was a problem—Mother said I'd been dominated—was hurting so much. My hair had gone grey, and it hurt so much when I got out of the airport. My hands hurt so much I was having to dig my nails into my palm to bear it. Then I hit my head on the boot of the car, and one of the yogis said, "Oh, that's better," while I was nearly dying of pain. They put garlands on us when we came in, and then we got into the car, and they all surreptitiously wound down the windows and put their hands out. We really learned a lot about protocol.

It was the first time we discovered how things were because there was no one to tell us. Up till then, we just chatted to her. Although we were naturally in awe of her, we still discussed things, argued sometimes, and asked about things, didn't we?

The worst argument was about drugs. That was quite early on, the first time I met Gregoire, at Gavin's house. There was a whole room full of hippies, all the local squatters, and they were all arguing with Mother, saying, "Drugs take you high, they're good, they're this and that." Mataji was trying to say that you can't get anywhere with drugs and you have to stop taking them. At one stage, she just sort of hugged herself and looked as if she couldn't... she just looked very unhappy.

At that moment, I felt that she couldn't cross the freedom of the people. If they wouldn't listen, there was nothing she could do. I just felt she looked like a mother, a primordial mother, surrounded by a lot of very naughty children. And so I thought, "OK, I'll stop. I'll give it a go."
