Interviewer's introduction and pleasantries have been removed for a clean start to the narrative.

I was in the first year of law at Delhi University, and I had been seeking. There used to be a place called Gandhi Bhavan where I used to go and do Hatha Yoga every morning. I'd been going there for a good three or four years, and Shri Mataji had been coming there, but I'd never heard of Shri Mataji. I'd never seen her photograph.

It was time. I saw her poster, and it said, "Kundalini awakening." I wasn't too sure what that meant, but I was like, "I'm going to go." I remember this date distinctly: it was the 13th of March, 1979. Shri Mataji walked in, and she was very different from the average guru you'd see who was more grave than grave itself. Here she was, walking with her disciples, with Sahaja Yogis, and she was laughing and smiling. She looked like a motherly figure.

Then she went and sat. She spoke. I can't remember the details; later, I did listen to the audio of the session. She talked about many things and, towards the end of the program, she said to put your hands up if you're feeling a cool breeze. Gandhi Bhavan is an amphitheater, so it has a dome-shaped roof, but the sides are open. When she said that, I was feeling a cool breeze, but I thought there must be some wind blowing from somewhere. So I looked around, and none of the plants, nothing was moving, but I could feel it. At that point, the cool breeze stopped, but I had enjoyed what I had heard, and I knew I was going to come back.

This is a funny story, but somebody came to me and said, "Are you feeling it?" And I said, "Yes." They kind of worked on me, and then they said, "Will we see you tomorrow?" And I said, "No," because I had booked a movie ticket to see Saturday Night Fever with some friends. So I said, "I'm going to see that movie tomorrow." They probably thought it was odd, but I was just being honest.

So the following day, I went for the movie. The next day, I went back to the meeting, and this time, the meeting was at 10 Ashoka Road. And I felt it so intensely. So intensely. I remember Greg came, and he was talking to me and said, "Have you got it?" He was looking at my eyes and said, "Oh, yeah, your eyes are dilated. So yes, you got it." The vibrations were just pouring into me. That was the most amazing experience. After that, I had no questions. I just knew this was it.

That was the start of my Sahaj journey. Because I had been seeking, I would go and see a guru or two, but I never stayed anywhere, probably because I didn't get anything. So my parents thought, "This is another one of his fads. Let's see how long it lasts." Well, it's been lasting now for 46 years. It's one of those things; it's an eternal imprint on your soul. I've never looked at anything else. This has been my life since, absolutely, thanks to Shri Mataji.

This was before the birthday puja because it was on the 13th of March, 1979. Coincidentally, in India, they have this thing of getting a horoscope made, so my parents had got my horoscope made. It said, "Your life is going to change when you turn 22." And on the 16th of March, I turned 22. So from one perspective, that prophecy that my life would change at 22 was very accurate, because I met Shri Mataji three days before. I would say I really felt my self-realization fully on the 15th of March. It was like I had touched a different state within myself.

I remember being a student, you had limited means. The next day happened to be my birthday, and I bought a box of sweets and took it to the meeting. When it was my turn—because those days we used to line up person by person—we would go at her feet. We actually put our hands under her feet and put our head on her feet. After I did that, I offered the sweets to her. She looked at me and she said, "This for me?" And I said, "Yes, Shri Mataji." She said, "Oh, no, no, it's too much." So she had a little bit and then she said, "Distribute to everyone." So I did that.

That was the start of my journey. We had the birthday celebration at an auditorium by the name of Kamini Auditorium, I think. That's how my journey with Sahaja Yoga started.

I can just tell you that I was literally hollow within myself. There used to be a Sahaja Yoga booklet which we used to have at those times. It had Shri Mataji's photograph on the front, and with that, they would give a black and white photograph of Shri Mataji. Inside, it was a folded pamphlet and it had all the information about the chakras, the deities, what the problems are, and this and that. I guess I had just been waiting for it, because I literally knew that within a day. I just memorized it. As I was reading through it, to me, it was like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is it. This just makes sense."

It was just fantastic. I can tell you that I probably started foot soaking within two days. Once they told me to foot soak, I foot soaked. And then I would make sure every morning I would wake up, go walking in the garden, walk barefoot on the grass, and look at the sky. It was literally like I was just being cleared out. It was something which I could never have imagined. That memory resides very strongly inside me, and that's the experience which sustained me. And Sahaja Yoga, as I think it's true of most of us, is the experience that we had with Shri Mataji.

I was very fortunate that those days she used to conduct the program herself. At Ten Ashoka Road, she used to do two sessions every day, morning and evening. In the morning, of course, I was in school attending classes, but in the evening, I would go for the program. The first weekend, I went for the afternoon session also. Two of my first friends in Sahaja Yoga who came and helped and guided me were Abdut Pai and Tony from London. Abdut said to me, "Why are you going back?" And I was like, "No, no, no, I don't want to be a trouble or burden to anyone." He said, "No, no, no, just sleep here."

In the Ten Ashoka Road bungalow, the way these old bungalows were, there was a central room and then around it were other rooms. One of the rooms was Shri Mataji's. I went and slept in the central area, and I remember I woke up at some point in the evening and saw Shri Mataji come out. I just saw so much light come with her. It was not any kind of a hallucination, but I could see her, and I could also see a lot of light coming from her.

A few days later, I asked one of the older Sahaja Yogis, his name was Uncle Karaka, who had come from Mumbai with her. I said, "Uncle, would it be possible for me to meet Shri Mataji?" He was like, "Okay, let me see." Then he came back and said, "Okay, you can go inside for five minutes." Shri Mataji was sitting inside with Sonu and Anand, her grandchildren. They were playing around, and she was sitting nicely, silently. She looked at me and said, "How are you feeling?" And I said, "I just feel wonderful." And Shri Mataji said, "Okay, good." We didn't have much of a conversation, actually. She closed her eyes, and I was just sitting there, absorbing vibrations from her. Beautifully, after five minutes, I got up to leave. And Shri Mataji said, "Where are you going?" I said, "Well, Shri Mataji, they'd asked me to come out." She said, "No, no, no, keep sitting." I have no idea how long I sat, but that was my first one-on-one interaction with her, and with both Sonu and Anand. I've known them since.

That was the beginning of Sahaja Yoga. In Delhi at that time, there weren't so many people, so we used to get so many opportunities to see her. Her daughter, Sadhana Didi, used to live in Sarvapriya Vihar. Shri Mataji would go to her house, and when she was there, she used to sleep on the terrace. We got so many opportunities to sit with her. There would be just three or four of us sitting with her until one or two in the morning, talking to her about all kinds of things. We asked her all kinds of questions, about the Bermuda Triangle. She explained that slaves had been thrown overboard there, and so many of them had been killed that way. When these clouds happen, it's those lost souls who are taking their revenge.

She would tell us so many other stories. We'd ask her many questions which, today, you look back and you say, "I can't believe I asked her those questions." But as a very patient mother, she would talk to us, explain things to us, and that's how things were built within us. It was the start of a wonderful journey.

This was normally around March or February, because towards the latter part of February, things would start to warm up in Delhi. Shri Mataji would often be in Delhi at that time. Normally, I think it used to be sometime in early April that she would leave to go back to England.

When I look back, until the time I came to Sahaja Yoga in Delhi, most of the people there were, I would say, more conservative, traditional Indians. Then some of us came, like me. I'd gone to school with the Irish brothers and nuns, so they were very particular about our English and how we spoke it. I think we had a little bit of a thing about it, that we spoke English well. We had a little ego about it, I would say, a subtle ego. But then I soon realized, when Shri Mataji would speak in Hindi, that for some reason we had neglected our own native tongue.

Shri Mataji used to talk about this author, Sharad Chandra. Devdas and all these movies are based on his writings. She used to talk about him very highly and said that, in her estimation, he was the most literary person because the way he could describe relationships and the nuances between people, nobody else had been able to do it so well. Once I started working, I used to travel a fair amount, so I started buying books by Sharad Chandra and I started reading Hindi. That's how I improved my Hindi. Once that improved, I realized the benefit of Hindi because the script is the same as Sanskrit, and all our scriptures and mantras are in Sanskrit. You can feel the difference. Very subtly, without telling us that we had an ego about things, she would teach us all these various things, and we started getting more connected to our roots.

In the early years, we had the opportunity of traveling with her a little bit in Maharashtra when she would do the India tours. We were once traveling with her and were going through the ghats, I think to Solapur and Kolhapur. She suddenly said, "Stop the car." She looked out at the hills and said, "You know, they're very barren." And she just looked at them like this. It's said in the Devi Bhagavatam that when the Goddess breathes, things come to life, and when she saw, life came into being. I was told that vegetation started coming over there, merely from her glancing at it.

I'll tell you a story which will make you laugh, but it's humorous and at the same time, it was a lesson. I came from the Sikh religion, so when I came to Sahaja Yoga, I used to wear a turban. This was in 1981. I was working for the Oberoi Hotels in a hotel management program. Sometimes I used to feel pressure on my head, so I once said to Shri Mataji, "I feel this pressure on my head." She looked at me and she laughed. She said, "You know, this thing that you wear, because of that, you get that pressure." So I said, "Okay." She didn't tell me that I should take it off or anything of the kind. She said that to me, but I understood it.

Being a Sikh, wearing a turban is a big deal to Sikh families because they associate that if you're wearing a turban, then you're a Sikh. If you're not wearing one, then you're not. Anyway, I tried to do all kinds of things. I told my parents, "I'm getting this pressure on my head." My mom actually came down to Delhi and arranged to see the top neurosurgeon. The guy examined me and said, "There's nothing wrong with him." I was like, "Okay, this ploy is not working." But I was a very determined guy. Once I decided I was doing something, I did it.

That year, Shri Mataji was going to go back to London. There was a friend of mine named Harsh, and that evening, Shri Mataji was taking her afternoon nap. I said to him, "Harsh, we're going." He said, "Going where?" I said, "We're going to the barber shop." He said, "Are you sure?" I said, "Yes." So, we went, and I got a haircut. We came back to Sadhana Didi's house in Sarvapriya Vihar. When Shri Mataji woke up in the afternoon and came out of her room, she looked at me and she smiled. I went to her feet and she said, "I am pleased because you're the first one who's cut his hair knowing that he's doing the right thing."

By no means am I saying that Shri Mataji said, "Go ahead, cut your hair." But it was that wearing a turban doesn't make you a Sikh. It is innately, are you that? You look at what people are doing, especially in the immigrant population in the UK and US. The amount they drink and some of the ways they behave—I'm not saying everybody does that, but quite a few people do—and yet, you wear the turban. That's an insult to Guru Nanak. That was one of those lessons from that time.

Another time, this is from 1998, it was Shri Mataji's 75th birthday, and I was in Delhi at that time. I had the opportunity to spend about five or six months with her. On her birthday, what do you give Adi Shakti? She's the source of everything. So I said, "Okay, let me get her a Guru Granth Sahib in Hindi." There's also a book which was written by the 10th Guru, Guru Gobind Singh, which is called Chandi Di Vaar, which is really the Durga Saptashati. It's really that. So I offered these books at her feet, and I remember Shri Mataji took them and put them to her heart.

Then I recited a verse which was written by Guru Gobind Singh, which said that he was the servant of God Almighty, that he came to see the play of the world. It talks of a peak in the Himalayas called Hemkunt, surrounded by seven beautiful peaks, where he did a lot of penance and meditated on Shri Mahakalika. When I recited that verse, Shri Mataji looked at me and said, "That's me. So why don't they understand?" I said, "Shri Mataji, that I think is beyond my capacity to say why they don't understand." But it's very evident from that verse and the very fact that he wrote this book called Chandi Di Vaar that he was a worshiper of the Goddess. He said at that time, it was required because between Guru Gobind Singh and Shivaji Maharaj, they were fighting Aurangzeb, who was forcibly converting people. So he told people, "I will give you a form that you cannot hide." Why did he give the form of a lion? The Goddess. And so he said, "I'll make you like a lion. You'll have a beard, you don't cut your hair, you'll have a kirpan—that's a sword, like the claws of a lion—to protect yourself and protect others."

Then she said to me—this is something I want to share with everyone—she said, "You know, it is possible that in Sahaja Yoga, we might have to go to a time when you might have to do regimentation, and we'll also have to take some kind of a form, a warrior-like thing." And the last word she said to me was, "When it's time to lift the sword, then don't fail at that time." She said this to me very clearly. All I'm saying is that with all the incarnations, they all were for peace, but in the path of peace, sometimes you have to take to arms when it's required.

What Sahaja Yoga did for me was help me become what I am. The minute I got my realization, I started understanding the benefits and the basics of what Indian culture is and why it is important and why certain things should be done in a particular way. I'll give you an example. I got married in 1983 in Sahaja Yoga. In those days, Shri Mataji would select our partners. She would say, "Okay, so I've chosen this one for you," and there wasn't really much conversation beyond that. We used to say, "Yes, Shri Mataji," and we would go and get married.

We lived with my parents at that time. A year later, I said to Shri Mataji... my father used to like to drink every evening. Before Sahaja Yoga, I would join him, not regularly, maybe once or twice a year, but he would drink every day. I said to her, "Shri Mataji, I'm thinking maybe I should move out and find a space for myself." She looked at me and said two words: "You've come to Sahaja Yoga to make, not to break." And that was the end of the conversation.

So I'm going to say this to you: Sahaja Yogis must have that sense of understanding, the respect for our elders, also the tolerance level. On the flip side, I know of other people who had problems with false gurus or things of that kind, and Shri Mataji would say, "Okay, fine, you need to find another place." But the reason for this is that you've got to build a community and you have to bring people up.

My children are grown up now; they have children themselves. I'm a grandfather. They grew up in Los Angeles. They had their beginning formative years of education in Delhi, but when they were in middle school and high school, they went to school over here. One of the things which she said, and this is for parents, is that there's no such thing as privacy. You must know everything they're doing. These days, you give children phones and all the rest of it. Parents need to look at the phones. This concept of, "Oh, you have your privacy," that's rubbish.

My daughter, when she was finishing high school, she traveled to Europe every year. She went to Cabella, and then she would travel in Europe. I knew exactly where she was staying because these were Sahaja Yogi families and friends of ours. I told her one simple thing: "Do not do anything to break my trust. Because once you break that trust, to get it back is going to be very difficult." I'm happy for the fact that she did not break that trust. What I'm saying is, even when you give children freedom, you still watch them, because they don't have that maturity, that sense and that wisdom which comes with age. As a parent, you have to do your job. You must do it so that they grow up to be good Sahaja Yogis. I see so many children who are born to Sahaja Yogis who are lost, and I'm like, "Why?" These were never our children. They are her children. It's our responsibility to keep them all right. Sometimes you have to be tough, and you have to scold.

My daughter, when she was 25, she turned to me and said, "Dad, you were such a tough cookie." I said, "Yeah, I know that." And she said, "But today I can thank you because you were tough. That kind of kept me in line and kept me where I am today. So I'm grateful to you." You can be friends, but never forget you are parents. You have to do your job as a parent.

In 1994, I was the one who got stabbed in San Diego during Navratri. I used to work for a fast food chain, Taco Bell. That night when it happened, I remember it very clearly. It was September 3rd. I was working a little late because I was training somebody new as a manager, so it took a little longer showing the processes, the reports, all that. By the time we finished, it was like 1:30 or 2:00 in the morning, and we stepped out. This was in a shopping mall called University Town Center, which was a pretty affluent area.

When we walked to the parking lot, the lights had been turned off. The guy I was teaching and I parted ways; he went one way, I went the opposite direction. When I opened my car, I suddenly saw some movement in the back. I had a briefcase and I put it down and I stepped out. When I stepped out, there was somebody in my car who had a knife, and he stabbed me right here on the center heart. Instinctively, my hand went on the blade, and we probably grappled for a minute or so. The knife broke, and the blade came into my hand. At that point, the guy ran away.

That's when I realized I was bleeding. It wasn't that I was fighting for my life; it was more a thing of, "How dare somebody do that?" I ran across, and the guy I had been training was about to drive off. I stopped him, and the poor guy was dazed because we had parted ways maybe five or seven minutes ago. I got into his car and said, "The guy went that way." We drove around for a couple of minutes but couldn't find anyone. Then I said to him, "You better take me to the hospital."

There was a hospital about two miles away, so he took me there. They did the preliminary things, and then I was transferred to a hospital which had a trauma center. They came and sewed me up. My pinky finger on the left hand had been cut, so they had to rebuild it.

People ask me, "Didn't you get frozen in fear?" And I said, "No, I did not." You'd be surprised; never in my life had I fought with anyone. But at that point, it just instinctively came to me. I was like, "No, you can't do that." Shri Mataji told that story to so many people, in so many ways. She smiled and laughed about it and said, "It wasn't that the Goddess came to protect him, but he protected himself." But then I looked at her and I said, "Shri Mataji, where did that courage come from? It came from you." She kind of twisted the whole thing, to put it like he saved himself. But where did the courage come from? That came from her.

When Canajoharie land was bought in the US, this was right after I had gotten stabbed. The good part of it is because I got stabbed, I was out on leave. Shri Mataji came to the US, she came to Chicago. So I wasn't working; I was just with her, cooking for her and all the rest of it. We were in New York at the Holiday Inn at LaGuardia Airport. I woke up in the morning and made tea for her like normal, gave her the newspaper, and we were having some small talk. Suddenly, her attention went to a small ad for Canajoharie. It was in the miscellaneous section or something, really small. She went straight there. She told me to call Manoj, who was the leader of America at that time.

So I called Manoj, and she said, "Find out about this property." He called the realtor, and the guy said it was available and asked if we would like to see it. Shri Mataji said yes. So the next day we went. It's upstate New York, a good four hours plus from New York City. We went there, she saw the land. While we were there, the realtor had come in an SUV, and we were in a regular sedan. He said to Shri Mataji, "Would you like to see the property, Mother?" because he heard us calling her Mother. She said yes, so she got into his car, and he drove her all around the property. The Devi actually blessed the whole property by going around it on the very first time, even before it was purchased.

She came back and she said, "We're buying it." The next day, the money was transferred. When we were going back to New York, she said, "Now we have to celebrate." There was a McDonald's as soon as we got on the freeway, and she said, "Okay, we're going to McDonald's." So we went to McDonald's and we had burgers and we had fries and we had Coke.

So sometimes the children come to me and say, "Our parents don't let us have Coke." I'm just going to say to the parents that it's not such a bad thing. If once in a while the kids have it, let them have it. The second part of it is, especially I think for Indians, we do not eat beef. Shri Mataji would say, "Don't eat an animal bigger than you because it affects your muscles, it affects your jaw, it affects your teeth." She had burgers all the time. So don't be with that mindset; break that conditioning. I don't eat beef normally, but burgers I do eat.

There's a thing that in Sahaja Yoga, you don't eat mushrooms. So this was in Noida in 1998. We were cooking for her for several months. One day she turned to me and she said, "Manish, you never make mushrooms for me." I said, "Okay, Shri Mataji." So the next day I made mushrooms for her. The moral of the story is this: don't just cut out anything. If you ate mushrooms once in a while, it's okay. She specifically asked me to cook those for her.

The second part of it is carnations. We never would buy carnations for her because there were all kinds of things said about them. I'll tell you, in the early years in Delhi, we used to get these garlands made of marigold. We didn't know any better and we offered them. But with carnations specifically, she turned around and said, "These are also my flowers." So again, don't get stuck on those things. I'm telling you actual interactions with her on these points.

Another thing I would like to say to Sahaja Yogis is that with children, they are Her children. They are not our children. There's an old talk of Shri Mataji's where she said that after a person falls from being a realized soul, then he doesn't go back to being a realized soul. Then they become a bhrasht Brahmin, and they become like a rakshasa. I don't know if people understand that point, because I see them indulging their children. Of course, children have their freedom, but it is also our responsibility to go out of the way to correct them, because they are her children put in our care. It is our responsibility to do whatever is possible so that they stay the way they were born to us. It's a big responsibility, and we just need to do what we need to do to make sure that the children are kept all right.

I was working in a hotel in Hyderabad, I think it was 1986 or '87. The city hadn't really started yet. There was a group of four or five families which lived a little bit outside Hyderabad in the DRDL colony. It was a defense research laboratory, and they used to do Sahaja Yoga amongst themselves. I said to them, "That can't be. It's meant for the masses. You don't have any of the locals here." So we decided to do a public program. We hired a hall in a place called Kachiguda, but I couldn't speak in Telugu.

There used to be an Uncle Moorthy from Madras, and he's the one who first invited Shri Mataji to the south of India. I called Uncle and I said, "Uncle, I need you here." He said, "I shall be there." He came down and he spoke to them in Telugu. Two hundred people came for that program. He came back the next day for the follow-up, and they stayed on. That's how Sahaja Yoga started in Hyderabad.

A few years later, around 1994 or '95, I had a work visa and was still waiting for my green card. My family was in India. Somebody said, "Hey, why don't you apply for migration to Canada? You have the qualifications. This is taking time." So I said okay. I submitted my papers to Canada. Some Sahaja Yogis in Canada got me an attorney, and all the rest of it happened. There was a due date. I mailed the papers by express mail, supposed to reach the next day. Somehow the papers disappeared. They got lost. They didn't show up for a good four days or a week, so it was after the due date.

Then Shri Mataji asked me, "What's happening with your immigration?" I said, "Well, nothing, but I've applied to Canada." She looked at me and she said, "No, it's the U.S." And then I laughed because the papers had disappeared. So it wasn't what she wanted. But that's also another lesson: listen to what she's saying. Don't try to do your two bits on it, because we think we are smarter. But we are not.
