Welcome again to this second session of Sari Stories. I'm delighted tonight that we've got Prena Richard and Luis Garrido, who are going to be sharing their stories with us. We're going to start with Prena. So, Prena, would you like me to open the first picture?

Not yet, no. Thank you.

Jai Shri Mataji, everyone. The stories for the saris with Shri Mataji are really special and have a special place in my heart because I met Shri Mataji when I was 14 years old. Growing up in India, being 14, I had never worn a sari until I met Shri Mataji. I wanted to start the stories because there were many things that happened in our time together with Shri Mataji that the saris kept coming up.

The very first time I met Shri Mataji was in August of '79. In those days, Shri Mataji used to go from London to Delhi; those were mostly the trips that she would have. We had a public program in Delhi, and my whole family and all of us went together. At the end of the public program, after we had gone on the stage to see Shri Mataji, she invited us to come to her house the next day. She said, "Find out the address and you all should come to my daughter's house. You all come and see me tomorrow morning."

When we got to her house, to Sadhna Didi's house, Shri Mataji was there. I'm not exactly sure how it happened, but somehow Sadhna Didi asked me and my sister if we had ever worn a sari. We both looked at her and we said, "No, we'd never worn a sari." So, she took out Shri Mataji's saris and she started wrapping them around us. Shri Mataji was sitting on a chair watching her dress us like dolls. She was turning us around and putting the pleats, and Shri Mataji was enjoying the show.

It was one of Shri Mataji's saris that she had put on us, and it just felt so joyful. It felt so... being enveloped with this feeling of just love. I can't explain it. I don't think I knew about vibrations then. I don't think I knew all of the rest of it connected, but I remember that feeling of just a big hug, like a big love that wrapped around us. So, that was the very first time that I'd worn a sari, and it was Shri Mataji's. A very special day. It's very vivid in my memory even now.

And the second story... so now we can put the picture up of that dress, Caroline, if that's okay with you.

I got married in '84. I married Alan, and back then, we were living in Delhi in a very small ashram compared to the Noida ashram. Shri Mataji was coming there in March of '84, after the India tour had finished and after her birthday puja. She came to Delhi, and everybody was asking, "Can everybody give saris so that we can make a pathway for Shri Mataji to walk from the door to the stage?"

I had just recently gotten married, so I had a whole bunch of new saris. Actually, when we were on the India tour—because we got married in Bordi, in Nasik—Shri Mataji had asked my sister, Namrata, and me to show her the saris that our mom had bought for us. I remember Shri Mataji was sitting on her bed in Nasik and wanted to see all the saris. Every time we would show her a sari, she would touch it and feel it, and she would make a comment of how pretty it was or the work was. It was very beautiful that we had got to share some of our new saris as newly married girls with Shri Mataji.

So, when she came to Delhi, they were asking for saris to decorate the pathway. I was feeling a little bit hesitant because I was thinking, "Oh, we're going to put them on the ground. People are going to walk on it. I don't want to ruin these new saris." But then I said, "Okay, it's okay. Shri Mataji's feet are going to be on it. I should find a sari and I will also contribute." It was this red silk sari, a plain red silk sari. It had no design, nothing. It was just very soft Chinese silk, just plain red. And I gave that to put on the pathway from the door to the stage.

Shri Mataji walked on it, and people had offered flowers like we always do, so there were flowers on the sari. After Shri Mataji walked, the flowers had gotten pressed into the sari, and the juices of the flowers had come out. Afterwards, when I picked up the sari, it was full of stains and covered with these marks from the flowers. I don't think I could wear it anymore because it was just all marks everywhere. I was feeling a little bit bad, but then again, Shri Mataji had walked on it, so it meant something so special and it was so dear.

I held on to it for the longest time. I mean, this year it was 40 years we were married, so I held on to the sari all these years. And then recently, I made it into a salwar kameez. This is the shirt. And the other piece, I actually took—and by then we'd had granddaughters—and we converted this into a tiny, tiny baby dress. It is so special because Shri Mataji walked on it, and it still feels so cool. I'm touching it right now, and it just feels so cool. Something to live on and tell the grandchildren about the day that the Goddess walked on this piece of material.

Then I had moved to London. We were in Brompton Square staying with Shri Mataji. And that's the next one, Caroline. You can show the picture of the next one.

When we got to Brompton Square, one day Shri Mataji showed me this white sari, the ones that she used to wear for the public programs. If you remember, they were plain white and they were so silky, just plain, plain white. She asked me if I could put a fall on it at the bottom. I had never done that. I had no idea how to sew a fall onto a very silky, slippery sari. I remember sitting in Brompton Square with the light right there and feeling so anxious and so nervous that I had to sew this fall on. I didn't want to make a mistake, and anything would show up because this material was so silky and so soft and slippery.

I prayed the whole time. I was just praying, "Please, Shri Mataji, help me, please. I've never done this. I don't know how to do this." And I did it. Shri Mataji was so gracious and so kind. She was like, "Oh, this is amazing. You did a great job," and all that. After that, it became a thing, and she would give me her public program saris to iron. I would get that opportunity to iron them.

This is the sari that Shri Mataji gifted me after I did the fall for her—which in effect, she did it, because I didn't know how to do that. She was giving me this. It was a Georgette sari, printed all over. I still have it. It has faded in many places, but I still hold on to it because she gifted it to me as a thank you for putting the fall and ironing, which was so kind of her and so sweet. That became a nice task, that somehow she would allow me to iron her public program saris in Brompton Square. There were many of those occasions, and I was so joyful. Such a beautiful thing.

And then the last story is the one, the last sari. This was in LA, and Shri Mataji was staying in LA. I want to say it was either 2003 or '04. Different centers in America, different collectives, would go to LA to have an opportunity to be there of service and just to offer whatever we could to help and contribute. Texas had a chance for one of the weeks, and we were there. This was a sari that was Shri Mataji's, and Sadhna Didi gave it to me and said that this is Shri Mataji's used sari and she would like for you to have it.

When she gave it to me, she said, "She would like for you to have it." And I said, "To keep? Thank you so much." And she said, "No, no, no. She wants you to wear it." I said, "Wear it? Like, wear Shri Mataji's sari?" I was a little bit surprised. And Sadhna Didi was like, "No, no, she wants you to wear it."

So, I have worn it only a couple of times because I still feel very hesitant to wear something that Shri Mataji wore; I'd rather just keep it. It has so much vibrations and it brings so much comfort. In times you go through rough times and tough times in life, I have held this just to my chest and on the heart, and it just soothes and comforts and builds all the vibrations in all the cells, and you can feel her presence. I'm sure many of you have experienced that when Shri Mataji's given something.

So, just little stories that meant a lot. Thank you for the opportunity to share them with you all.

Thank you, Prena. That was beautiful. I have you pinned for the video recording, so I'm just going to unpin you and I'll close your video now. Ask Luis to join us. So, Luis, I think there you are. Lovely. Let me just pin you. Excellent.

Jai Shri Mataji.

Would you like to show some photos, Caroline?

Sure, I'm at your command. What would you like me to show?

Shri Mataji at the wedding of Maria Amelia and Arnaud. There's two there. Yes, that's one of them.

So, this is Maria Amelia and Arnaud's wedding, which took place in Portugal in 1980. The thing that I find very interesting is that this is the color of the Portuguese flag. The Portuguese flag is red and green, but this is the exact correct green of the flag. I don't think this is a coincidence that Shri Mataji wore the color of the Portuguese flag for us, because in everything Mataji does, she's trying to open our hearts and make us feel well. This was, I think, a beautiful gesture of Shri Mataji to choose that color.

If you see on the photo also of the wedding of Maria Amelia... can you see another one? It's called Shri Mataji in Sintra. It's the same wedding. Here you can see again the green on the sari blouse. It's exactly the green of the Portuguese flag. I don't think it's a coincidence, because Mother came to Portugal.

Now, if you could move to a photograph that is entitled Shri Mataji in Lisbon. This is again Shri Mataji in Lisbon, Portugal. Here, Shri Mataji is about to go to the airport, I believe. In fact, I'm the person there on the left-hand side with the beard. That's me, very thin in those days. That was the beginning of Sahaja Yoga for me. The dog is there too, next to me.

Shri Mataji is wearing a sari that is yellow here, and this is again quite interesting for Portugal because in Portugal we say we are the country of the sun. Shri Mataji is wearing the color of the sun. It's a totally yellow sari, but then she also has a kind of a purple color on the blouse and on the other part of the sari. This is a color that everybody in Portugal will say is the color of Christ because during the Easter processions, usually the statues of Christ are dressed in that color. I think it's because in the Bible it says that when Christ went on the trail, he was sent to Herod. Herod decided to send Christ back to Pontius Pilate to be tried, but he also said, "Let's put a tunic or a cloth of this purple color on Christ." This was, in a sense, to mock Christ, as if to say, "If he thinks that he's the king of the Jews, let him wear the purple, which is the color reserved for royalty." But in fact, all the painters and artistic tradition considered that Christ is indeed the king of all kings, so he deserves to wear that color purple. That's usually the color that is used for Christ during Easter.

This color is very important because Portugal is a Catholic country and everybody knows about Christ and the Easter processions. And the yellow sun that Mother is wearing, for us, has a special meaning in Portugal because we say we are the country of the sun. The sun is the thing about Portugal. There was an apparition of the Virgin Mary in Portugal, and she confirmed that those apparitions are genuine. When Mother came again to Portugal for Diwali Puja, she said, "Yes, those apparitions of the Virgin Mary, they were genuine. That was indeed Shri Mahalakshmi who appeared there and gave those miracles." One of the miracles that Sri Mahalakshmi gave is that she made the sun dance in the sky because people had asked for a sign to believe. When Mother is dressed with this yellow and this purple, this has a great symbolic meaning for Portugal.

In that photograph, we were taking all the suitcases out of the place where she was staying in 1982. I was very new to Sahaj then. We were taking the suitcases of Dr. Rustam, who was traveling with Mother, and Shri Mataji's suitcases to the car to take Mother to the airport. Suddenly Mother said, "Bring my suitcases back." We were quite agitated, in a rush for going to the airport, and we brought Shri Mataji's suitcases back to the house. She said, "Put them on this table." Then she made an arrangement of saris and said, "Look, I promised this Sahaja Yogi there that I was going to give him an art lesson." Mother always keeps her promises, so she said, "Let's do the art lesson now," and she used the saris to give an art lesson.

At the time, because I was very new, the main thing on my mind was, "Who is Shri Mataji?" I had such an incredible experience when she gave me self-realization, and I had already had an opportunity to rub Mother's feet. The question really burning in my heart was, "Who is this lady, Shri Mataji?" I asked the Sahaja Yogis, "Do you think she's the Virgin Mary or do you think she's like Christ?" But they would not answer the question. They would smile and you could feel the joy, but they just wouldn't answer me. I asked Dr. Rustam, who was a great expert in Sahaja Yoga and Sanskrit, "Who is this lady?" He said, "Well, that's something you have to discover yourself." I wanted a kind of an official answer before Mother went back to London, but no, this is something you have to answer yourself.

So when Mother started showing her saris, this was the question in my heart. While Mother was showing the saris, I started feeling that this is the type of a dress for a goddess, really. This is like the dress for the Virgin Mary, those silk saris. Because when they describe the dress of the Virgin Mary in visions in Fatima and other places, it's like these saris; the lady is totally covered in silk, in white or maybe pearl color. Seeing those saris of Mother, with all the colors, the silk, pearl and white, my heart was telling me this really is the Goddess. The saris were really speaking to me in that sense of, "This is the type of a dress for a goddess. Only a goddess can dress like this."

Shri Mataji told us to look at the saris and choose one that we liked the most. We all made our decision and then Mother asked us one by one what our favorite sari was. Mother was also finding out about our feelings about the colors, how we would react. She likes to use the saris to please people so that we enjoy meeting her the most. For instance, a Sahaja Yogini from France told us a story that Mother was having a reception for very important French ladies, a diplomatic meeting. She asked this French Sahaja Yogini, "Come and see me at Brompton Square and help me choose a sari, whichever sari would please the French ladies the most, so they feel at home, they feel I'm one of them." I think Mother did the same for us in Portugal in the choice of saris that she chose.

After finding out which ones we liked, she started directing our attention to the ones we didn't choose. A few saris that nobody chose, Mother went for those and started explaining the beauty of those patterns and colors. She told that Sahaja Yogi that the patterns in the saris, some of them are very ideal patterns for using in ceramics, for instance, because they have a repetitive pattern and a certain rhythm. Mother was also telling him to put attention to the Mother Earth and learn about ceramics and work with the clay, and that would awaken his creativity and the innocence and the clearing of the Mooladhara chakra. Some of those motifs in the Indian saris were created by people who are simple and work with the land, so they have a very strong connection with the Motherland, with Mother Nature. And Mother Nature gave a lot of the inspiration for the patterns that we find in the saris. It was an incredible lesson Mother gave to all of us.

At another occasion, this was a lot later at Brompton Square, Shri Mataji was going through a box of jewelry to give a lesson to a certain Sahaja Yogi who was learning about jewelry. I was looking at the jewelry and Mother said, "Luis, by the way, do you happen to know why it is that Indian ladies wear so much jewelry?" I said I had no idea. Mother said, "That's because the Goddess used to wear a lot of jewelry. You can see that when you read the mantras. And the Goddess always has to wear a sari. In India, all the ladies learn from their mothers that they also have to wear a lot of jewelry with the sari because the Goddess also did." Mother had a tremendous respect for the sari and for these traditions.

So much so that on one occasion, we all came to a puja in Birmingham. The puja was about to start. We were all dressed in our pajama kurtas, the ladies were dressed in their saris, and Mother was sitting on the stage. Then Mother asked, "Do you have a sari for the puja?" The leader said that the person bringing the sari got detained. Mother said, "Okay, that's no problem. But if there's no sari, no puja. It's as simple as that. So, why don't we do the puja the next day?" This was a big shock because we were all dressed and ready, but Mother said, "Look, don't be upset for this change of plan because this is a lot of fun. I enjoy myself," Mother said. She went to her handbag, got her glasses, and said, "And now I'm going to see how the ladies look so beautiful in their saris, and how the gentlemen also are looking so nice in their silks and pajama kurtas." They changed the lighting from Shri Mataji on the stage to the yogis, so Mother could see the yogis now. She said she was really enjoying seeing all the ladies in their saris, how beautiful they look.

There was another puja, this time I think it was in Hampstead around 1985. During the puja, Shri Mataji said, "Now the ladies who have never done a puja to me, they can come to the stage and do it." Two ladies came, dressed in jeans. They were not wearing a sari. And Mother said, "That's not possible. Someone should have given them saris or taught them how to wear a sari. It's not hard to find a sari in England. In the future, make sure you teach all the new people. If they come to a puja, the ladies especially must wear a sari. And the gentlemen also must wear the Indian kurtas."

Strangely enough, after one program, Shri Mataji said, "Now on the way back to your countries, especially the English going on British Airways, make sure you wear your saris and your dhotis. Wear your pajama kurtas, and don't forget to wear also the red dot on the forehead." So we did that. When we arrived in London, some Sahaja Yogis were there to collect us, and they saw us coming off the flight all dressed up like that. They said, "Oh my God, have you gone mad? This is not allowed. Are you behaving like the Hare Krishna people?" But they didn't know Mother told us to do that. She also said, "When you go to work or when you go shopping, don't be afraid to wear the saris and to wear the pajama kurtas." So we did.

I remember once going out shopping in my whites, and someone came to talk to me. "Oh, you must be a baker," because I was dressed completely in white with a little white hat and the red dot. "You must be a baker." I said, "I'm sorry, I'm not a baker." We talked about Sahaja Yoga and we laughed a lot. Carol also went for a job interview wearing a sari. She didn't get the job, but she knew she wasn't going to get it anyway; she was just going for practice. So many Sahaja Yogis did that. Nothing happened.

There were occasions where Carol went to the airport to see Mother, and she decided to wear a sari. Some English Sahaja Yogis told her, "Carol, you must be a little bit crazy to come dressed in a sari to an airport. Are you not worried that Mother might tell you off?" But Carol felt, "No, I don't see why." And in fact, Mother was very pleased that she came dressed in a sari and spoke to her. Everything went beautifully. She did that a few more times and still other people who didn't know would come and tell her, "Carol, are you going bonkers? This is the airport!" So there was a certain fear of this type of clothes.

One day I came all the way from Portugal especially to meet Shri Mataji. I had been in London for about three weeks, waiting for a chance to see her. This was 1983. Then an invitation came: Mother is going to see a sari fashion show, and everybody's welcome. The message came rather late, so we knew we couldn't arrive on time. We were running all the way to the tube and running all over the place. We were late. When we arrived at the center, it was a big exhibition about products exported from India. We couldn't find Mother anywhere. We went through three different floors and just couldn't find her.

In the end, Mother appeared after a long time, and by then we were exhausted. The Sahaja Yogi with me asked, "Where were you? We couldn't find you anywhere." Mother said, "Where else could I be? Watching the saris fashion show. There's really nothing else to see here. This is the most important thing. Make sure you don't miss it, because these ladies are so beautiful modeling the saris. So beautiful, so innocent, so sweet, so elegant, so dignified. What a beautiful thing. You really should see this." At all times, Mother was showing tremendous respect for the saris.

I've noticed that all Sahaja Yogis are enthusiastic about seeing Mother dressed in a sari, how well she looks. Sometimes we are watching a video at home, me and Carol, and Carol says, "Oh, can you rewind to the beginning?" She wants to see Mother entering the stage wearing a beautiful sari. Sometimes it's just a white sari, and she says, "Oh, how beautiful. Can you rewind again?" It's like a vision of a goddess coming onto the stage. Sahaja Yoginis are very enthusiastic about Mother and her saris, but Mother is also appreciative of when the Sahaja Yoginis wear them.

On the Indian tour, we were there to get married. Mother had already arranged our marriage in England, and now she told us to come to India to get a Sahaja marriage as well. The message came: "Mother is going to select the saris for the brides. So gentlemen, please make sure you come and bring your wallets. It's your chance to buy the sari for your bride." Everybody came. There was a whole truck full of saris. Mother, being such an expert, went through the whole consignment at fast speed because she just knows immediately what is a good sari and what's not. Most of them she would reject. Then she would touch one, see it, and check the price. If the price was not right, she would reject the sari straight away. Mother was careful to save our money as well.

What care and attention Mother put into those saris, and what expertise. Then she created several piles of saris she approved. For the brides, there were three piles: lower price, medium price, and more expensive. Then there was a pile of saris for people who want to buy a really expensive sari to take home as a special gift. Then there were other piles of saris for daily use during the tour, and another pile for going to pujas or public programs. What a complex thing, but she's a top expert.

One day at Mother's house, I happened to be there with one other Sahaja Yogi. That day, Mother had to go to a very important diplomatic conference. Mother had a domestic assistant, a young man, who was in charge of ironing her saris. We had seen him doing it, but we didn't know how. That day, he was ill. The time was ticking, and someone would be coming at any moment to pick her up. So, Mother looked at us and said, "Can you iron me a sari?" We said, "Of course, Mother, no problem," full of confidence. The problem is that none of us had ever ironed a sari. And this was a very special, very expensive sari for a very important event. It would be a big shame if we burned it or spoiled it. We asked Mother to help, although she was upstairs. And the sari got ironed.

On this occasion, we really got to see the sari in great detail. Usually we don't notice in such detail, but ironing the sari gave that experience. We noticed we were getting really thoughtless while ironing it. It was a special experience I only did once in my life, but it felt special to pass that test. Everything went well; Mother was guiding us.

Then Mother wore the sari. We may not notice so much when Mother is wearing a sari, but on that occasion, we really saw it, how amazing she looked. My wife, Carol, used to complain sometimes. When I came from having seen Mother, she would want to know everything that happened. The first thing Carol always asked me is, "What was the color of the sari?" "Oh, I don't know. I didn't see." "What a disaster! You forgot to see the color of the sari Mother was wearing. Please, next time, at least tell me the color of the sari." So that's the one time I was able to describe the sari in great detail because we had ironed it and we saw Mother wearing it straight away.

As Mother went down the steps wearing that sari, I got a kind of a vision that she was gliding on a cloud. Usually we see Mother more as a human person, but she seemed to be gliding on a cloud, going down the stairs, going into the car. That was an incredible vision, a special moment that I still remember today.

There was more to that day. The young man who was Mother's assistant was ill. He had worked in a chemical factory in India and had gotten very sick. He asked Mother for a job, and she taught him how to cook professionally in two weeks. He had become so strong, but he still felt very sick with nausea if he had to go in a car or bus. He had gone out that day and was missing, and Mother knew he was feeling very sick. She was very worried about him. It was getting so late, and he was still missing. He would have to walk a huge distance. Mother said, "I really don't want to go to this conference now, but it's my duty." It looked like Mother also needed a miracle. And that's what happened.

Mother was standing there, all dressed, ready to go, and suddenly he arrives. Mother went and met him outside the front entrance immediately and worked on him. She raised his Kundalini, put him in a bandhan, and gave bandhans on his navel. Suddenly he was looking normal, not exhausted. And as Mother finished working on him, immediately the limousine arrived. What a tremendous timing. So Mother did exactly what she wanted to do to look after this boy, and then the car arrived and she went. Absolutely perfect timing.

At Shuddhi Camps, Mother was moving to Italy and Pratistan. She was selling her house and had to pack everything to go on a shipping container. There was a lot to do, but Mother was absolutely relaxed about it. Some ladies came to help, and there were also plenty of men. Mother said, "Alright, I think the boys are going to help me to pack the saris and the ladies can do the crockery." So we started packing her saris, bringing lots of suitcases full of them. Some suitcases would not open; they had a three-digit combination lock. Mother knew and told us the code is 108. All the suitcases opened except for four because they were old and rusted. We tried all numbers, but they just wouldn't open.

Mother said, "Let me see." She started rubbing the wheels of the suitcase, the lock mechanism, while talking to us as if paying no attention. Then she would say, "Okay, you can try now." We would put back 108 and there you go, now it opens. It's amazing what Mother can do with vibrations. She opened three suitcases like this. Then came the last one. Mother tried the same but it just wouldn't open. We were thinking, "Well, we can get a screwdriver or a hammer," but Mother said, "No, no, wait. Is there a label?" "Oh, yes, there's a label." "What does it say?" "Kalpana." "Oh, there you go! I'm not meant to open it." The vibrations respect all the dharmas. Even the vibrations didn't open that suitcase because it was not Mother's; it was Kalpana's. So we had a good laugh.

While packing, Mother was telling us about the tours and the status of Sahaja Yoga in the world. She would tell us, "This sari goes in this box, that one goes in that box." We were just bringing saris to Mother, and we had to wait our turn. I was standing there with three of Mother's saris on my hands, and my hands were going very, very cool. We were clearing out. Mother would look at the saris, show them to us, and tell us the story of all of them. She said maybe we should have a museum of saris; it's such an important art from India. We could see the saris are precious because just holding them, our hands would go totally cold.

Then another box came. It was not saris; it was actually Mother's shoes. The vibrations were so amazing that even Mother said, "Oh my goodness, this is incredible." Mother was amazed at how strong the vibrations were. She stopped the work, and we put all our saris and suitcases back. Mother went into meditation and said, "Ah, it's incredible. What vibrations. Can you feel this?" So we sat down. Mother said, "You can close your eyes if you want." Mother also closed her eyes, and we went into meditation. It was unforgettable.

On the tour, Carol was wearing a sari, and Mother said, "Oh, you look so Indian." Carol told Mother for the first time, "Mother, actually, I was born in India." "Oh, so only now you tell me! But you've been telling me you came from Sheffield. I've asked you so many times." That's because she got realization in Sheffield. "Sometimes you tell me that you came from Brighton or from Lewes. By the way, I knew you don't come from those places because human beings are like flowers or plants. Wherever they are born, that's their natural environment. It's written inside of them. What took you so long to tell me that you were born in India? The fact you were born in India, actually, is a great blessing that helped you to find Sahaja Yoga." So Carol told Mother that she was actually born in India, but Mother knows everything. This is what's so incredible.

I think this is the last one. On the previous session, Fergie mentioned Hounslow Ashram and Mother packing saris into a box and locking it. Certain things were disappearing at Hounslow Ashram; there was a thief. Important ceramics were being stolen. So people knew there was a thief. Mother said, "Don't worry, we'll catch the thief. Meanwhile, if you don't leave valuables lying around, lock them." One day Mother was there and she saw the person. She knew this was the thief. Mother challenged him, and he realized that Mother knows everything. It's incredible. So he confessed and he promised to bring the stuff back. We never heard of him again. But Mother knew she could catch the thief if she wants to.

This is the place where Mother came to meet her domestic assistant. That's where she worked on him, and once she finished, the limousine arrived and Mother was just gliding down to the car. It brought back that vision to me. I cannot forget those events.

Well, thank you so much, Luis. It's been wonderful. It's been absolutely a joy to listen to you and to Prena this evening. So, I'm going to just stop the recording now.
