I had been seeking for a long time in an intellectual way; I hadn't identified with any particular cult or anything like that. One day I saw a little advertisement in the NME, the New Musical Express, saying that on June 5th, 1978, Shri Mataji would grant en masse self-realisation at Caxton Hall. It didn't mention Sahaja Yoga at all, it just said this.

I was fascinated by this because the idea of collective, en masse self-realisation—the individuation—was exactly what I'd been looking for. All my mental conclusions had come to the same point: that this is what we need to change the world, something that is collective yet also individual at the same time.

As it happened, I had no money in those days and lived a very lazy sort of life. Some friends were moving up to London that day, to Holland Park, so I got a lift with them and went along to Caxton Hall. Now, these friends, the guy who was moving was a guitarist, and he had a band. They needed a name for this band, which was a kind of acoustic jazz band—very nice music, actually. An old school friend of mine had come up with a name he'd found in a book about medieval Indian religion, and the name was Sahaja.

When I got to Caxton Hall, I was a very self-conscious, shy kind of person, and I had a dread that I would be invited in and it would all be so happy-clappy, hugging each other. On the outside, there was this big poster, and it said, "Sahaja Yoga."

So, I went in. At that meeting, which must have been one of the early ones at Caxton Hall, there were some leaflets on the chairs. They said something about who Shri Mataji was—that she had been married, for example—but I just did not doubt this, somehow. Gregoire gave the introduction, which was a very strong one, calling on the deities to support what he was saying.

Then Shri Mataji spoke. A lot of people had Vishuddhi problems, and I couldn't actually make out everything she was saying, though she spoke perfectly distinctly. After some questions, she turned to me. I was sitting in the middle. I had thought, "If I sit at the back of the room, they might say, 'Everyone at the back move to the front.' If I sit at the front, I'll already be in the firing line." That was my intellectual way of thinking, so I sat in the middle.

She looked at me and said, "Ah, an intellectual." I had very, very long, thick hair and some John Lennon specs. She said, "You won't find the answer in books." As shy as I was, I heard myself say in front of all these people, "Yes, I know that." She also told me I should get my hair cut because entities can get in hair like that. I think she knew I wasn't going to run away.

The people worked on me, and they said some things about what they felt, which were astonishing to me. I just felt that this was a matter of destiny. I'd always felt that I was in this world for some purpose, something to do with changing the world for the better. And so I never looked back, although I didn't feel very much myself for a long time.
