 (England)
So, we'll just start with a silent meditation for about 10 minutes while other people join us, and Rita will be playing some music. I'll take you through a couple of balancing mantras at the beginning, and then we'll have silent meditation with music in the background before we start the evening.

I think it's nice when we're meditating if we just all turn our cameras off, so we're not watching each other raise our Kundalinis. If everybody is now ready to meditate, we can just all do a little namaskar to Shri Mataji and collectively raise our Kundalini and put on bandhan.

Thank you.

With our right hand on the ground or pointing towards Mother Earth, we'll say three times the mantra to Shri Ganesha, asking Him to overcome any obstacles that there might be to us meeting joyfully this evening.
Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Ganesha Sakshat Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namo Namah.

With our right hand still on the ground, we'll take the mantra for the whole of the left side, just to balance and clear out the left side and let it drain into the earth. And that's Shri Mahakali, Bhairava, Michael.
Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Mahakali Shri Bhairava Shri Michael Sakshat Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namo Namah.

Then move our right hand onto our knee again and our left hand pointing towards the ether. Now, all the heat of our activities throughout the day can drain into the ether through our left hand as we say the mantra to Shri Mahasaraswati, Hanumana, Gabriel.
Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Mahasaraswati Shri Hanumana Shri Gabriel Sakshat Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Namo Namah.

Thank you. We'll take the mantra for the central channel. In a moment, Rita will start some music, and we'll just sit for a few minutes in silence. I suggest that during the music, we all just raise our Kundalini again three times. Just raise, moving our right hand up along the central channel, up over the top of our head, and with our hands spiraling out from the center of our Sahasrara to take in the whole of the top of the head, three times. I always find that it brings up so much more of the Kundalini.

We'll listen to music for five or six minutes, and then Rita will be playing one of the very earliest bhajans and also showing a clip of Shri Mataji.

(Music and video presentation)

Well, we were planning to show you a video of Shri Mataji entering the Thames—I think the first time that she entered the waters of the source of the Thames—but I'm not sure if we're able to. So let's just dive straight in. It is almost ten to eight anyway.

Welcome, everybody. Everybody that was here the last times and everybody that's come for the first time. This time I see that Linda Williams has gotten on; she's managed to beat the technology and join us. That's wonderful.

As you know, this is an occasion for us to share stories about the early days and about our meetings with Shri Mataji. We've specifically asked a handful of people if they can share a story to start off with. We're expecting this to last about an hour and a half, so until about nine o'clock. After they've spoken, we'll just open it up for anybody to offer the recollections that they have.

The list I have... Mira is on my list, but I can't see her anywhere. I'm not sure she's been able to join us. But then Ruth Flint, Catherine de Kalvermaarten, Annegret—I've seen—and Ken Williams. So Ruth, can I pass the word to you? Would you like to unmute yourself and tell us your story? So nice to see you.

Good evening, everybody. It's nice to see all these familiar faces. I heard that we were supposed to say where we wanted to go to a public program, but my story is a bit different. So I can say it very briefly for those who don't know it.

I was a seeker, like many of us, and I was lucky enough to meet Grégoire in 1981 in Rome. I had heard he had lived in the Orient, and as I loved the history of art, I asked—because there was something in Christianity, but I had left the church—I asked him if he was interested in religions. He said yes, a little bit. And then I asked, "Where did you find a way of putting together Oriental religion and Christianity?" He said, "Yes, I think so." So I said, "Well, please tell me." And he said all religions are like a pyramid. At the base, they are all far away from each other, but the more you go up towards the essence, the more they get close to each other, and they are one.

I loved this answer very much. And then I started asking him day after day—because we were working together—questions about what he told me the day before, what it meant. He never said the word Sahaja Yoga, never spoke about Shri Mataji, but explained more and more, and I liked it a lot.

So, the day of the marriage of Charles and Diana, everybody at work was watching the marriage on the TV. He told me, "Come, let's go to your office, and I'll make you a little drawing." He made the drawing of the chakras and said, "You see, this is realized once you are at the top there." Because I had read about realization and Kundalini, I told him, "That's what I want."

He gave me an appointment one week later at the flat with him and Catherine. They gave me realization. I think maybe a few days before, he gave me a photocopy of a newspaper article with a photo of Shri Mataji. He said, "Put your feet in the water while looking at this photocopy." So I did that, and he introduced me to Shri Mataji. I recognized her; I did not need him to tell me anything about who she was. It came naturally. And then a few months later, I met her. That's how it is. Beautiful.

Catherine, would you like to carry on? Or not carry on, but tell one story.

Yes, okay. Good evening, everybody. It's nice that we have this meeting and we can see each other. At least see each other.

I was studying, and I was not a seeker as such. What I always felt is that if we had a party, I would come home with no added value. So in that sense, I was not a party girl. And studying kept us quite busy, from eight in the morning to six in the evening.

I was discussing that with a colleague of mine. As long as we study from eight to six, there's not much in the evening to do a lot of nonsense with life. But once we are out of university, how do we manage so that we don't go astray? So she started to tell me, "Look, if you want to know how to manage your life properly, I have a system where you get to know yourself and get to know what's right and wrong."

A few weeks later, her brother joined her, and they gave me realization with practically no introduction. They sat me before a picture, saying, "This is a lady who can help you connect to this energy which you are born with. Connecting to her will help you to manage your life."

Alright. But what happened after a nice dinner, the three of us together, I walked home and... you can say it was a vision, but it was like a revelation. It was clear to me. I saw it like a train. This is the rail which I'm going to take, straight ahead. Forward. Onto the left, my family would drop out. Onto the right, my friends and colleagues would drop out. And go on.

Then, three months later, I was in London for a birthday. I didn't speak English, so somebody was helping me understand what she was saying. And what she was saying to me when I first washed her feet, which we all could do at that time... yeah. That was pretty much just clear. That was going to be my life, and it stayed like that. Hopefully.

I'll pass it back to Annegret. We'd love to hear what took you to Sahaja Yoga for the first time. What were your impressions?

Well, I'll tell you how I came to get my realization. I was brought up in the Catholic church, and I remember I must have been seven or eight years old. I always loved the month of May, which is, in the Catholic church, the month of Mother Mary, where they especially worship Mother Mary. My teachers were nuns in the Catholic school, and when we were doing well on Saturdays, we always got a token with a picture of Mother Mary. There were different pictures of Mother Mary with the child. I remember in the month of May, I always put a little altar on my night table with this picture of Mother Mary and a few flowers around. I just did it. It gave me such a good feeling.

Years went by, and I became a teenager. More and more, I felt there's a lot of untruth in this Catholic church. I couldn't accept and understand many things. There was a sort of rebellion also inside of me, and when I was 18, I decided I was officially leaving the Catholic church. So that was one thing, but I had nothing else. I was not aware of seeking. I started reading a lot of esoterical books, and I was trying to find it through my work in psychology and so on, but nothing really satisfied me.

Then I thought, well, I'm going to travel. I had read a lot about Buddhism and a bit about the Hinduistic religion, but it never really gave me this feeling of "that's it." So finally, I went on big journeys which brought me to India. I traveled for nearly a year around India. There I could really visit... I was up in Ladakh, in Kashmir, and visited all these temples of the Buddhists, of the Tibetans, of the Hindus. I only could feel, each time, that there's a lot of ritualism, there's a lot of strange things, there is a lot of money and power behind it. It was always the same as I felt in the Catholic church.

Finally, I thought this is my illusion. There is nothing which is something like a truth. So I went back home. But it didn't leave me. After two years, I had to go back to India again because I had this strong feeling that something was waiting for me there. I went back to India again. Strangely enough, when I went to Mumbai, I had the feeling, "What did I do? This is nonsense to start again, to go through all this which didn't bring you to what you were looking for." So I traveled again for three months, but it was all the same. I was so empty inside. There was no joy in my heart. There was no light inside of me, I had the feeling. So I decided, either I go back to Germany, or I go again to the Himalayas where I was before, and go up to the Himalayas for trekking.

This is finally what I did. I went to Nepal, I went to Kathmandu. I went on this big Everest trip up to 5,000 meters. And all the same. All the same. I was in this beautiful, extraordinary, stunning nature—such a silence, snow and stone and beauty and this deep silence—but inside of me, there was nearly desperation.

There was one thing. Often in the evening, when we stayed with other travelers, we slept around an open fire in these simple lodges in our sleeping bags. We were all fed up with the food we had for several weeks already, which was mostly rice and dal. We were all craving our homey foods, each one in a different way. So each time, we started talking about food. What we would like, what... it was just going on. Often, someone said, "When you are back in Kathmandu, you have to go to this Austrian restaurant which is there. They have the most delicious food." As a German from the south of Germany, which is nearly Austria, this is my homey food. So I thought, well, if nothing else comforts me and satisfies me, this is my goal. When I'm back in Kathmandu on my first evening, I am there in this restaurant.

And this is what I did. On my first evening, I went to this restaurant. There was a photo of an Indian lady on the wall. The owner of this restaurant was an Austrian called Lieselotte. I asked her, "Who is this lady on this photo?" And she said, "Well, if I have time in between the servings, I'll come and tell you a little bit." So she came and told me a few things. She explained very briefly, and my first reaction was, "Oh, another philosophy, another belief, another guru."

But then, something hooked me. She said, "You can feel it immediately on your hands with a cool breeze, or on top of your head. You can verify, and you have to verify yourself, only yourself, that you feel that." She invited me the next day to come to her house, and she could work on me and would tell me more.

This is what I did. The next day I went to her. I had only one week left in Kathmandu before I went back to Germany. She put me immediately in a foot soak and worked on me. In the back, she had a lot of glass bangles on her arms, and it made such a rattle. She was making sounds like, "Oh, what did you do?" And I went, "Oh my gosh." I didn't understand a word. I was just sitting in the foot soak and waiting. I felt nothing. Afterwards, I left her. I had felt nothing, no cool breeze, neither in my hands. And she invited me to come every day.

So I went back from her to my hotel, alone, through Kathmandu. Suddenly, it hit me. It was like someone had put on the light in my heart. It was so clear and so obvious. This desperation was completely gone. And I felt, clearly, "Gosh, I have arrived home. What is this?" I felt packed, like in a down jacket of protection. That was my first and very strong feeling. All this emptiness that I felt before, all this desperation, had completely vanished.

So I went every day to her. She worked on me, and we talked a lot. Then I went back to Munich. I started meditating. There was no yogi in Munich; there was only one in the whole of Germany. So, after a few weeks, I contacted Grégoire, who was in Vienna at that time, if he could send me his book so I could read a little bit. I needed some support.

I got my realization in '84, in April, in Kathmandu. And in the same month, Shri Mataji was in Australia. There, she asked an Australian yogi who was married to a German to go to Munich, where I lived, and start Sahaja Yoga there. And this is what he did. Grégoire made a connection and sent me a letter, and we met up. We started meditating together. It started for me there, and I saw Shri Mataji only a few months later in Switzerland at the Shri Ganesha puja, where I saw her for the first time.

So, this is my story. The food did not satisfy me, but through the food, I got the satisfaction for what I was seeking. That's my story.

Beautiful, beautiful story. Ken, off to you.

Oh, it's me now. How do I follow that one? I can't follow that one. My story is nowhere near as dramatic and incredibly emotional as that. Such a beautiful story you've told. So we're going to come down to the mundane a little bit now.

The two themes for tonight are so interrelated, you can just answer them really: what was your main desire when you first met Shri Mataji, and how was your first experience? So, I'll combine those questions.

I need to go back to probably my first real experience of God, which was back in 1972. I went to church with my family as a child in Canada. It meant nothing to me. It was just a lot of people singing hymns that went on forever. I had some vague belief in the possibility of God; that's all I had. But when I went to theater school in 1972 to train as an actor, my life just became much deeper, and I think that's when any seeking really began.

I just remember at one point, everything was getting on top of me and it just seemed like I couldn't cope. It was a very intensive course. I just remember one day, I was alone in our flat and I just found myself sort of collapsing onto the floor in what I would now know is like a namaskar. As we would bow to Shri Mataji, I was just down like that, completely humbling down and just saying, "Help me please, help me please." I didn't even know who I was saying that to, just reaching out to the universe.

I had the most amazing experience of just being lifted, like feeling within being lifted up somehow. I just had this feeling of a presence, and I felt at that point it was God saying to me, "I'm here. Don't worry, I'm here. I'm real, and I'm there in your heart. But you must promise me something. Don't ever get involved with any of these groups. No Maharishi, no Hare Krishna, no Jesus freaks, nothing. You will only find me in your heart." So I was never attracted to any of those things. They all repulsed me—Billy Graham, all these things that came along and promised to release you.

Then, fast forward to moving to England in 1983. In 1989, I had been practicing my craft as an actor. I think my greatest desire at that time was to unlock the potential in me to communicate as an artist, as an actor. I began to get a sense in theater school of what that might be, but I could never quite reach it. I discovered Hatha yoga maybe about ten years earlier, and I did find that helpful because it was unleashing certain energies within me. But there was no real focus to it. I felt I needed guidance, a teacher. As I said, I knew I wasn't going to find it in any of these other groups and so-called religions.

It just happened that one day, I was walking up the hill—I lived on Highgate Hill in London, if that means anything to anyone—and I saw a poster on a bus stop for the meeting at Porchester Hall. There was Shri Mataji's big, lovely face. I walked past it and I just found myself going back. Now, this was unlike me. I was never drawn to these things, but I found this picture drew me. I can't remember anymore the exact wording on the poster, but it was basically saying Sahaja Yoga is the only way to save the world and to find your inner self. And I thought, "Well, that's quite a claim. I'd love to go and hear this lady speak and see if she can back that up." Because that's amazing. That's sort of how my mind was working. I thought, "If she can really deliver that, I'm interested."

I was surprised at my own lack of skepticism because normally, I would be. I remember thinking—because I assumed that she was from India, I didn't realize she was living in the UK at the time—"Well, her followers must be really excited that she's in this country." I don't know why that came into my head, but it did, quite strongly. Anyway, I made a note of the time and date of the meeting, which was just a few days away.

I got up to my flat and, lo and behold, a leaflet had been put through the door. I remember my exact thought was, "Hmm, maybe the universe is trying to tell me something." I read the leaflet, and it was quite a detailed leaflet about the life of Shri Mataji. I've always advocated that that sort of thing should be in a leaflet, because that's what made me come. If it had just been a plain leaflet advertising the meeting and saying nothing more, I probably wouldn't have come. But the fact that it talked about her and her association with Gandhi, that really got me going. And I thought, "I'm going."

Long story short, I love telling this part. When the day came to go to the meeting, I went down to the tube station, Archway station. Station closed. There was a fire. Now, if I hadn't had this strength of desire, I might have said, "Oh well, I guess it's not meant to be." But no. I've got to get there somehow. I'll just get on any bus that's going vaguely in the direction of the next tube station. Anyway, I ended up getting on this bus that was going to Hammersmith. I was just following it in my A to Z. It ended up dropping me—and I mean, London is a big city, the odds against this are pretty high—but it ended up dropping me right at the top of the road where Porchester Hall is. So I remember thinking, "Ah, the universe really is... I'm meant to be here."

So I went in and was handed my little photograph of Shri Mataji, which I still have to this day. It was the classic black and white, with little instructions on how to meditate. I came into this meeting, and there were people playing bhajans, and that went on forever and ever. I think it was supposed to start at 7:30, and here it was 8:30, no Shri Mataji yet. But I remember thinking, what went through my head was, "This is a test." Because I didn't find the bhajans very interesting, to be honest. I said, "This is a test. The true seekers will stay."

Then David Spiro got up and he said, "Would you all stand please?" That was a really quite a magical moment because the hall went very quiet. This magnificent lady came in and took her place up on the stage without a word. She put on her glasses and just sat there very silently. They started resuming the bhajans, and that went on for a long, long time, it seemed. But I was just caught up in the spell somehow—spell is probably the wrong word—but in the atmosphere.

When she spoke, I couldn't understand. I understood about two-thirds of what she said because the hall was very echoey, and I wasn't used to her strong Indian accent. But I got the gist. When she said, "We're going to enter the kingdom of God," I thought, "God, I just wanted to improve myself as an actor. This is great! We're actually going to enter the kingdom of God." I'm telling it in a funny way, but there was this... I expected just a good yoga teacher that would help me be a better actor or whatever. And here was this lady saying we could enter the kingdom of God. Here was me actually believing it and saying, "Well, I wish I'd worn a tie or something, because this is big."

I did everything and went through the whole realization exercise. I can't say that I felt the cool breeze or anything, but it was just feeling much more than that somehow. A cool breeze didn't even seem important at that point. I could just feel the fullness of everything.

Then we were invited to go up and meet Shri Mataji and be worked on. I didn't do it because the queue was so long, and I was hungry. The food theme. I was starving, and I thought, "This is so much to absorb. I'm just fine. I'm just going to go home and find a takeaway or something." Well, I went outside and immediately there was a bus. I just got on this bus, went up to the top, and there were other people there. I thought, "I wonder if these people can see that I've had something really special happen to me."

I probably had a nibble or something when I got home, but I wasn't even concerned about food. I just forgot about the food and just took this wonderful thing home with me. I went to a follow-up meeting after that, and that was great. But the first time I went to a regular Sahaj weekly meeting at Hampstead, I remember thinking, "Well, I hope these meetings are going to live up to everything I felt that day. I don't know if this was kind of a one-off thing. Are the people who run these meetings as special as she is?"

Well, I needn't have worried. When I arrived at this meeting, everyone was in silent meditation. The meeting had already just begun, and there was nothing playing or no one talking, just absolute silent meditation. I felt like a wall, literally, of vibrations, as if I was just entering another world. I just sat down, and I knew how to raise my Kundalini and did all that. It was just the most beautiful thing.

Then Mother's video came on, introduced, of course, by Patti Prohl. Patti Prohl was like this angel that stood at the front of the room. She was beaming, absolutely beaming, and said, "I see that there's some new people here," and all that kind of thing. I felt so welcomed. Then Mother's talk came on, and I thought, "I am so in the right place."

My wife, Jacqueline, we had just had a three-month-old baby, our second child, so she was home with the baby. I just started going regularly. I didn't say much about it. I told her a little bit about self-realization, but I didn't say anything about cool breezes because I still didn't feel a cool breeze.

Then one morning, after about four or five weeks, I woke up and I just felt it spontaneously. I wasn't even meditating or anything. I went, "Oh my goodness!" I woke Jacqueline. I said, "You know this self-realization I've been telling you about? Put your hand over my head." I'd never mentioned cool breezes to her. And she literally went, "Oh, so it feels like a cool wind coming out of your head?" I said, "That's the self-realization I've been telling you about."

So that day, we sat down with a cassette. I sat her down and said, "This is going to maybe feel a bit funny when I put this candle here and this photograph here, and you're going to listen to this and tell me how you feel." She listened, and in the end, she was speechless. All she could say was, "She's saying everything I've always felt in my heart." I went, "Yes." Because it was important to me that we would both feel it.

After a while, she started to back away a bit. Maybe she felt I was being too pushy with it. So she said, "I don't know if I want to..." I said, "Don't worry. Just stop for a while. Stop meditating. It's fine. Just come to it in your own time." So she did.

Oh gosh, you can stop me anytime. I've got to go in five minutes...

Ken, I've just been told that Mira has actually been able to join. So if you don't feel that I'm stopping you in mid-flow, then I will gently stop you now.

I will be back, as Arnold Schwarzenegger said. I'm sure you have lots more stories to tell us. The trouble is that once you get going, one after another comes into your head. We've all had that experience. So I'll leave it there. Thank you so much for letting me tell you about my first experience. I'm going to check out now because I've got another meeting, believe it or not, at 8:30. An acting meeting. So, bye everyone.

Mira, are you here now? Can you hear me?

Yes, I can hear you. Lovely. I'm seeing you as well. It's so wonderful that you are missing me. Such a feeling. I tried for half an hour to get in. Then finally, Gunther called me and sent me the link, so I got in. I'm very happy, even a little bit later. So nice to see Maureen and everybody.

Did you have a story that you wanted to share? I missed the beginning.

People have been talking mostly about how they got their realization. But any story that you think we would like to enjoy, really, Mira.

Okay, maybe I will start with that. It's a long time back. It happened in my life, like for many of us, during a very, very difficult period. I got very sick, and I didn't know if I would survive or how my life would go on. I think many times, that's when you start to ask, as I did. I asked God, "Okay, what is this? If I have to die, then I will die. But what will happen with my children?" Still, I didn't give up. That was the beginning of my seeking. Probably even earlier, but that was when I really started to search.

I went to study astrology because I wanted to know about my life. Why is this happening to me? I have never done anything wrong to others and yet I am suffering like that. The teacher's wife was a very active lady. She went everywhere for meditation, to all the gurus. She always asked me to come, and I said, "I don't know. I don't want to meditate." I was not really interested in that, maybe because I didn't know much about it.

Then one day, she asked me for directions to a street where she wanted to go for a program. That was a Sahaj program. I had a lot of pain, and she just told me, "You know, you just do this, and then you will get fine." So I said, "Okay, let's go."

I went there with her. It was a normal Sahaj program. I didn't understand much. I was listening to what they were doing and how they did the realization program. At the end, I was sitting in front of a picture. I think in that moment, this connection started to grow in me, vibrationally. Then someone worked on me. I didn't know who it was. I opened my eyes and she was sitting there, really, in her form. I couldn't speak. I didn't know what to say. I didn't understand what was going on.

But then I started to go to the programs. I wanted to know more. I wanted to know the techniques and went everywhere: to France, to Marie-Louise. It was a very difficult beginning. I just wanted to meet her, I wanted to see her. But everybody told me, "You cannot go. You have to wait one or two years." And I said, "No, I don't want to wait that long."

I think it was Olivier who told me that there would be a puja in Portugal. I said, "Okay, I will go there." I just went and booked my ticket. I had no idea about anything. I went to the airport, and many Sahaja Yogis were there waiting. They looked at me, "Oh, what are you doing here?" I said, "I am going to meet Shri Mataji." That was my desire, very strong. This connection from the first moment was enormous. And that was the beginning of my life.

It was not always easy. But in that program, I remember it was a beautiful place in Sintra. When we arrived, Shri Mataji arrived five minutes later. From that moment, I had no pain. It already started. I felt the whole vibration working in my body, even if I didn't understand what was going on. It was an amazing first meeting. I was like a child. I felt like a child. I was joyful and happy and hungry because I didn't know about the food or the time. I didn't understand anything. I was just happy to see Shri Mataji. Lovely. That's my first story.

Before I open it up generally, I'd like to follow on from that with my story, because it's kind of the opposite.

In 1988, I was working on the same floor at Olivetti as Javier Valderrama, who quite a lot of you will know. Essentially, he just hammered away at me until I finally gave in and agreed to try Sahaja Yoga meditation. He was so determined that I would try it that he opened the local center just for me because on the night that everybody met, I had karate, and I wasn't prepared to give it up at the time. He took me there and he gave me my realization.

Not content with that, a week later he had me around his house where Chris and Ruth Greaves were staying at the time. He had them work on me. And not content with that, another week after that, he picked me up from the airport when I came back from a business trip in order to take me to a joint Italian and German puja at Lago di Braies. That was my first puja. And a bit like Ken, one of the main things that struck me was all the banks of food down the sides of the puja hall.

Then, as if that wasn't enough, a month after I got my realization, he brought me to Shridevi Camps for my first puja with Shri Mataji. At that puja, there was a call for young ladies to go up—I suppose we should say girls, but I was 30. One of the girls I knew from the Italian collective grabbed my hand and dragged me up. So, at my first puja, I found myself decorating Shri Mataji's feet. I was shown to rub the kumkum into my hands so that my hands were red.

After the puja, the Italians had to leave early because we had an early flight back to Italy. Everybody else was loath to go, but we had to leave just before they started giving the presents to Shri Mataji. We got to the airport quite late, so Javier got me, with my hands still red, and sent me to the front of the queue. He said, "Hold your hands like this to them and tell them we have to get on the plane and that they should let us through now." So I did. And they did. Wow.

Now, it's quite open for anybody who wants to speak.

For me, this is always so amazing, the individual stories of each one of us. There is no one which is similar. It's just true to our personality, to our life, from where we came, what we are. Amazing. So beautiful.

Brigitte, I'm sure you have a multitude of wonderful stories. I don't know whether you'd feel like relating one of them this evening.

That's very sweet of you. I'll try to make it short.

Basically, when I was very young, probably seven years old, I was looking through the window one morning. It must have been spring. I felt the presence of God in a very, very strong way. It was just a feeling of tremendous joy. I was born in a very, very Catholic family, and of course, I went to church and went through the whole process. I was not very happy about what they would say and not do. I was imagining that things had to be much simpler, much more available, much more handy, if one can say.

I had heard about gurus, but I had also heard that you cannot choose the guru; the guru will choose you. So I used to go to Holy Communion, as it is in the Catholic church. When I was around 12 or 13 years old, I would pray, "Please, God, send me a guru, because things must be much simpler than what I hear."

Time went on. When I was 24, I was invited to a meeting that Grégoire gave about his experience in Nepal, where he had been a teacher at university. We went to that meeting very late, so we were all standing. By the end of the meeting, where frankly I didn't hear a word because I was planning on leaving for Mexico three or four days later with my elder son, he said, "Well, I'm over, but I would like to share a very special experience about meditation." My ears just went plunk. A lot of people left, so I could sit.

Basically, which is quite incredible, he just told us to remove our shoes and put our hands on our lap. He was just mentioning, "You are on a sunny day on a beach. The sun is warm, and you're feeling good, and you're feeling so relaxed." That was basically just what he was saying for a certain time. Probably the yogis behind were trying to raise the Kundalinis. After some time, he just mentioned, "Does somebody feel a kind of cool breeze in the center of the palm?" It was obvious. He said, "Please, if somebody feels it, can you raise your hand?" So I raised my hand. He came behind me and just exploded with joy, "She's got it!" I thought, "Wow, what has happened to me must be something very special."

I did feel the cool breeze, but I had absolutely no clue what had happened. As I said, we left a very short time later for Mexico. Grégoire tried to see me just after this conference and said, "Just take this picture. Take it with you. It's too short for me to explain to you right now, but what has happened is very important."

We left for Mexico, and of course, I had this picture somewhere in my luggage. The very interesting thing is that, although I didn't believe what the priests would say, I was needing to go to church, needing to pray. Suddenly, in Mexico—and Mexico is special, it's almost black magic in those churches—I got completely disgusted with the Catholic church. I was a bit desperate to find something. I remember one day doing shopping for the house, I saw a place where they were announcing a meditation course. I remember coming back to that place, entering the hall, and feeling weird and just going away again.

Anyway, that year my second son was born. After his birth, we suddenly decided to go to Switzerland for Christmas. Things happened, and they decided that my husband shouldn't continue working in Mexico, that we would be transferred to Egypt. I was living with my parents, and coming back from Mexico because I had to pack the house, I saw this small little card from Grégoire announcing the coming of Shri Mataji in April 1980 in Lausanne. Frankly, I felt such a joy. Today, I know what had happened to me. Actually, my Kundalini came up.

My two children were very young, and I had to really get organized to go to L'Hôtel de la Paix in Lausanne for two nights of conference. But I went there. I sat right in front. With all my Catholic conditioning, I was really expecting to see someone very thin, sitting almost on nails, very strict and ascetic. Here comes this beautiful lady in a white sari, bubbling and so motherly.

To cut the seriousness about it, Grégoire had done a very big introduction. At that time, the mics had a big cord. He was speaking and speaking and speaking and finally ended up being tied by the cord. He fell right down at the feet of Shri Mataji with an explosion of laughter in the hall, and Shri Mataji also. He said, "Well, I think I have been speaking for too much time, and it's time that Shri Mataji can speak."

The next day, I was very lucky because I could see Shri Mataji in the flat where she was staying. One of the questions I asked her was, "Shri Mataji, I had the feeling of the presence of God since I was very young. In the church, we are told that Christ is God. So why don't I feel the same immensity of love and joy for Christ? Because the father and the son are just one God."

Shri Mataji started working on my hands, doing Ganesha's symbol and a cross on the other hand. Of course, she was doing this famous sound we have been hearing so often, like, "Oh, it's there, it's there." But frankly, I didn't feel anything. I finally said yes because I felt a bit shameful not to feel as I was probably supposed to feel.

But the beautiful thing is that many years later, maybe three or four years later, in Pune on the India tour, there was a speech by Shri Mataji. I was sitting there fighting with all my strength not to fall asleep because the heaviness was so strong on me. Suddenly—I'm not able to really describe what happened to me, I can't remember in very precise detail—but it was suddenly just obvious. I felt that tremendous unity, maybe, or connection to this all-pervading love, but also coming from Christ. Voilà.

That was one story. In September, Shri Mataji had to come again, and I was really blessed because she came to my parents' house. I had done a little trick on my father to have his house by the lake. Shri Mataji was there, and we all slept with her in her room—the women upstairs and the men downstairs. At the conference that night, my father came. Just to make it more spicy, at the end of the talk, she said, "Tomorrow, I invite you all into my house. Brigitte, can you give the address?" My father went "bloop" because he didn't realize I had organized all that for Shri Mataji. But that was a wonderful experience.

Thank you, Brigitte. That's beautiful. Time is moving on a little bit, but if anybody has another story, it would be wonderful to finish off with.

I'm so happy to be with you and to share all these beautiful stories. Thank you for this opportunity.

My first experience... I was knowing Marie-Laure, Grégoire's sister, for quite a long time. I was 14, she was 15. We could see each other sometimes for our holidays. I was in France, she was in Switzerland. One day, in July 1978, she had already gotten realization from Grégoire. I went to her studio in Lausanne, and she gave me my realization. I was so entangled in this mundane maya and all these mundane things that I could feel something, but certainly not the depth of it.

One day, I went with Grégoire, Amelia, Arnaud, and Marie-Laure to London. We were very, very lucky because Shri Mataji asked us to come for tea. We went there. My liver was so bad. When I saw her, I was absolutely surprised to see a person so beautiful, so simple. Her skin was absolutely shining, as if it was silk. I was amazed to see such a person, especially so simple because I was so much in these mundane, Catholic things.

Shri Mataji asked us to sit, and we had tea with her. She was speaking so nicely. I could feel her motherhood so much. Suddenly, because my liver was so bad, I was feeling extremely cold. So cold, I was absolutely freezing. I felt a little bit shameful to be like this, but I didn't say anything. Of course, she noticed it. She just took her shawl off her shoulders and put her shawl on my shoulders.

The feeling... I will never be able to describe what it was. It's exactly as if I was in some lukewarm water. A wonderful feeling. I knew that something wonderful was existing. I was so bad in these mundane things, and suddenly this experience... Shri Mataji had been so compassionate to give it to me. Otherwise, probably I would never have been able to find the depth. I knew that something was there which was wonderful, because this feeling that I felt in my inner being was incredible. So I've been very lucky for that. After that, I knew I could climb the ladder up to something more beautiful.

I will always, always be so grateful towards Shri Mataji because of her infinite compassion. She gave me this experience just to know that something absolutely wonderful was there. So that was my first experience seeing Shri Mataji. I'm still very moved about it. I'm sorry, I'm not going to cry right in front of you like this, but after so many years, we are still moved by it.

Thank you again for this opportunity to tell it. It's so beautiful. Since these difficult times, it's lovely to hear that. Thank you so much.

We should hear from others for the next time, because it's already going to be nine o'clock. Maybe we can have a short meditation and then close. We are going to meet every second Wednesday of each month.

A huge thank you to all of you who have joined in again this evening. I think it's pretty obvious that we're all enjoying your stories, hearing about all these different experiences, and reliving them with you. They do bring tears of joy and emotion of all sorts to all of us, so don't be ashamed of the tears. They are good tears.

It's obvious that we're going to have a full program next time, which will be on the second Wednesday of the month, regularly. There seems to be a good need for it. We are also going to propose a WhatsApp group for this group. Anybody who would like to join it will be invited. Instructions will come along in due course. It's going to be for... we haven't really found a good word for people who had their realization a long time ago.

Early Yogis?
We could be called the dinosaurs.
No, I don't like that one.
Foundation stones?

Watch out for a decision on the terminology, but there will be an invitation to join this WhatsApp group.

Perhaps I could just finish by pointing out a strange situation. Cosmos has arisen out of the pandemic. When the pandemic started, we were all shut down. We could not meet with friends, family, and particularly other yogis. We could not go to places where we could meet up for meditation or pujas. For some of us, it was extremely difficult. We were isolated. But thankfully, Shalini and some friends thought about this and pulled in people from various places and put them into these little circles where we meet together, six or seven of us. We talk about problems we have, joys we are experiencing, miracles that are happening. And out of the circles, this group has risen. So this is why I am saying that COVID has given rise to Cosmos.

Thank you all again for coming this evening and spending time together. What a joy.

I would also like to invite you... we are also starting sessions for parents on the last two Wednesdays of each month. I just had a feeling that it is important for parents, especially parents of teenagers, to meet each other. There are so many challenges in that age group for both children and parents. So if you have time, we will send you the invitation. Please join in, bring your experience, and we will ask you in which way you can contribute. So that is another thing that is coming out of Cosmos. You all are welcome to join. Have a lovely evening.

Ladies and gentlemen, can we just take our attention... I mean, it already is there, but just use our hands to make sure that it's there, and then raise our Kundalini and put our bandhan on.

Thank you all.

(A chorus of goodbyes and thank yous)

It was beautiful. Thank you. From all around the world, so lovely. Precious faces. It's difficult to disconnect. When you hear these stories, you realize again what an amazing happening it was in our lives. Absolutely.

Have a good week, all of you. Bye-bye.
