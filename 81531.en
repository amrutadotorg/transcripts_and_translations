My husband Pete and I—we weren't married then, but we got married shortly after—went to the meeting at Dr. Johnson House in Birmingham. I think it was the 9th of July, definitely in July 1982. I was brought up in the Methodist Church and believed in God absolutely. I had the experience of reading all the way through the Gospels when I was 15, and it was a very strong experience.

But in the church itself, something seemed to be missing, like with Mark and Mary. For me, it was expressed by the fact that when people went up to take communion, which happens just once a month in the Methodist Church, there was no joy in their faces when they came back. They were good people, but that bliss that I knew should be there, I couldn't see it. So, I gradually stopped going to church. Pete had been brought up a Catholic and had also stopped going to church. Then, Pete's father started coming to Sahaja Yoga. He told us about it and said, "Oh, there's a meeting. Shri Mataji will be here. You must come."

I was slightly apprehensive, so I took a paperback copy of the Penguin Metaphysical Poets—the poets of the 17th century. It's beautiful religious poetry. I felt that if there was something wrong, it might protect me in some way, so I kept it underneath my chair. Anyway, Shri Mataji gave people realisation. I can't remember an exact moment; I can just remember being absolutely in bliss at the end, feeling total joy. The room we were in had big windows looking northwestward, and it was an incredibly beautiful sky. We asked if we could go with the others to McDonald's for coffee, but we were told we couldn't because we had only just come. I was very sad about that.

I noticed two things afterward. One, John mentioned Shri Mataji saying, "This is the way it is." I was sitting in the kitchen with a tape of Shri Mataji giving a talk, and I'm not even sure I was paying that much attention, but suddenly the words in my mind were, "She speaks as one who has authority." That phrase about Christ just came to me. The other thing was, I had diabetes from being a child, and my right thumb—my right Svadisthana—had gotten very stiff and painful in the winter. I'd had that for about three years. A few months later, I realized it had just gone. It was completely cured.

Thank you.
