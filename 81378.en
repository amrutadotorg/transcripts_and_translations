Jai Shri Mataji. Thank you, Jai Shri Mataji, for getting us together this evening for a session. And Jai Shri Mataji is telling about the qualities of a woman, the Gruha Lakshmi, the homemaker in this Shri Fatima Puja talk in Turkey in 1993. We are assembled here today to discuss this very rare and increasingly endangered quality of women: the woman as the homemaker. In Sahaja Yoga, as we know, the woman is the Shakti, the power. And yet, these winds of change are sort of questioning or unruffling this trend.

We have this session because Shri Mataji spent 14 years in England, in the heart of the universe. So if you would please, Maureen Rossi, Grazyna, and Felicity Payment, first of all, thank you for taking your time and joining us. If you would please share your memories of Shri Mataji, the perfect Gruha Lakshmi, and the qualities that you saw from her that we hope to emulate and pass on to the society and make it a largely beneficial, holistic, and ethical society.

Maureen, would you like to start the evening, please, with your recollection of Shri Mataji as the Gruha Lakshmi?

*

Maureen: Yes, thank you. Well, I think the first thing that I'll recount is something that Shri Mataji told me very early on when we were in India for our first tour, which was 1977. It was a three-month tour and we stayed with Sahaja Yogis the whole time, always in families. Shri Mataji described to me that the women's power is "the love behind the curtain." She explained to me that what she meant was that it's a power that is not shown off. It's very much self-contained, but nonetheless incredibly strong.

When I was in India, one of the families we stayed with was a gentleman called Mr. Rao, and he had a farm. His wife used to stand just behind the curtain watching if she could do anything for us as her guests. I very much felt like I was seeing a play of that power. She was there, not subservient, but literally attentive and seeing what she could do until her guests were properly attended to. She was quite shy and she smiled sweetly if we caught her eye. But she ran that house. She ran the whole thing. She had multiple relatives staying there—brothers, uncles, grandparents—but never obviously in our face, if you like. This was something that I felt later on when Shri Mataji gave that talk about Gruha Lakshmi's powers.

It's something that is incredibly subtle, the same as Sahaja Yoga is incredibly subtle. We have to be aware that life has become incredibly gross and that people's desires are even emulating that. It might seem to modern people that the idea of perhaps serving a guest in that way is a little bit putting yourself down. But if you see that someone has that power and they're confident in that power, they don't need to make a big fuss about it. It's something far stronger than if someone strode into the room and said, "There's food over there, help yourself," which is kind of the modern way, isn't it? The "I want to join the party too" kind of thing. So that's what I would say in a nutshell is how I feel about this special quality and special place that the ladies, the women, have to uphold.

*

Moderator: Thank you, Maureen. And Grazyna, would you like to share your experience of Shri Mataji as the Gruha Lakshmi? We'll go on to Felicity after Grazyna.

And then can we also talk about the woman? Of course, we know as a mother, she has a family, she has all of us, and she has the whole world and the universe. She's the source of all that power. How did you sort of glean from that power and directly apply it in your lives, if I were to make it more relevant and contemporary? Because it might seem to some viewers, maybe in times to come that, like you say, just standing behind the curtain—she's not hiding, but keeping a watchful eye—of what's going on, who wants what, and where she can arrange to do things. In today's circumstances, as you say, it's very much in your face: crash the party, or just buffet, help yourself. Those finer niceties are sort of slowly fading away, shall we say. So, it would be great if you could all cover this aspect, please. Grazyna.

*

Grazyna: Well, for me, from what I have seen, the way Shri Mataji was as a Gruha Lakshmi was a little bit different because it was love, but it was very much universal for everyone. We have this love in the household, and Shri Mataji loved her family and looked after the family, but at the same time, she was expanding this love to everyone.

So, for me, the Gruha Lakshmi quality is also benevolence to everyone. Shri Mataji was benevolent to everyone, and as a housewife, that's our role. We are nourishing and benevolent to our husband, our children, their friends, further family, neighbors. We create harmony and peace, and that's how Shri Mataji was creating love, harmony, and peace.

She is the best example of everything. She would give us presents, she would take us to concerts, she would cook for us. When I first came, she understood my situation immediately and she helped me so much without me even asking. So, intuitively, women know what is good to be done for the family, for friends, for everyone. That's how the Gruha Lakshmi, in my view, should be. She has to have a heart that is a feeling heart, a heart full of love.

*

Moderator: Okay, thank you for that, Grazyna. Felicity?

*

Felicity: As I was listening, the qualities that were really coming to my attention were graciousness, love, and giving. I remember seeing with Shri Mataji her concern. When she would be in a room with people, she would always be asking, "How are you?" And not just, "Oh, how are you?" but really, "How are you? How is your family?" Sometimes she would ask people about what work they were doing, how things were going in their lives, because she wanted to help them bring balance and have successful lives.

For me, I feel like everything that I am is because of Shri Mataji. Over so many years of listening to her, we were fortunate to interact with her. It's hard to separate, in some ways, who I was from what I am now. The growth is continuous and subtle on many levels.

One of the things that I wanted to share about giving as a Lakshmi was from being in Dollis Hill Ashram. I had a lot of problems with my chakras when I first came. But when we were in a room together, we used to work on each other a lot. I remember one time, even when Mother was there in the living room at Dollis Hill, there was somebody next to me. For some reason, something about them touched my heart, and I remember having this instinctive reaction to want to give and help. I must have started somehow giving vibrations in a subtle way, because Shri Mataji was there in front of us, and she suddenly stopped and looked and said, "And look at Felicity, look how much she's come up. It's the giving." And I thought, "Oh!" When you give with your heart, when you give with love, with vibrations, it actually has a beneficial effect on you. So by giving and working on other people, I was also clearing myself without realizing it.

When I became a wife first, and then a mother, then your giving capacity is tested, but it just increases. I remember having three children and being told we were going to have twins. I remember feeling, "But my heart is so full for these three children already. How can I love two more?" And then they're born and somehow your heart just expands. I feel like that is something that we should understand. Shri Mataji said to us, "You have all my powers. You have so many powers," and they really are there. We often aren't aware of them until we're in a situation where you're challenged, and you can rise to that.

One other little thing: after we'd been married 20 years, we had five children and we were part of the collective. We decided we wanted to celebrate this and take food to the ashram and feed everybody. It felt like this was a really nice, joyful thing. We've actually been married 20 years, that's pretty amazing, let's just share this joy with everyone. I remember we cooked food ahead of time, then we took it to the ashram and had it all laid out, actually buffet style. Everybody came. I remember standing there, feeling the love and the joy of everybody, and I suddenly had this sense inside myself that somehow over these 20 years of giving, of loving, of supporting the family, of working out how to be a wife and mother—because it's a learning process, a learning experience that you build on—I suddenly felt that I had accumulated boons from this 20 years of work and love. I just felt like Mother was giving me all these blessings and that I somehow had these boons. I remember asking that everyone should feel the love in the room. It was such a tangible thing.

So it's such a very subtle experience being a wife and mother and a Gruha Lakshmi. It takes time to find that balance, to maintain your sense of self, of who you are, of your spirit, and at the same time, being able to give and take care of everybody else. I think it took me quite some time to understand that it all comes down to balance, that you have to have balance in everything. That's my little bit.

*

Moderator: Fantastic. Fantastic. Maureen, would you like to share how, in our cases, the husbands and the wives are the two wheels of a chariot? They are equal, but not the same. In our days and times, people would probably be laughing 50 or 100 years later when times change, probably for better or for worse. How was that practiced as you saw it with Shri Mataji and yourself?

*

Maureen: Right. Well, with Shri Mataji, obviously early on, we saw a lot of Shri Mataji in her family life with her husband, Sir C.P. It was incredible to see how she balanced this amazing job that she had taken on of bringing self-realization to the world with being not just a wife, but a diplomat's wife. She did everything from doing the cooking—I can remember standing there, watching her cooking in the kitchen. I felt I should do something, so I got ahold of a cloth and started wiping things down. I thought I must help in some way, and I got slightly carried away and was going down the sides of the cabinets. Shri Mataji sort of said to me, "It's good, but not too much." It was just like a lesson, a bit like Felicity is saying, you keep in the balance. We tend to be either very, very sloppy or very, very particular in our housewife-type things or our households. It's keeping that balance. As Mother said, not so clean that "not even a rat would enter" and you can't have a visitor, or the other side, the hippie sort of side where there are piles of rubbish everywhere.

Watching Shri Mataji balance that role of a loving, supportive wife, doing everything, and yet the next minute, she would be dealing with a whole room of seekers and giving that same love and attention to each one, not missing anybody out. She had concern that everybody got their food. She gave me a coat once. "Have a coat, it's cold out." When she put it on me, she said, "This looks very nice on you." It was one of her coats and I wore it until it virtually dropped off me.

But she also encouraged us as women to go into education, to get jobs. She encouraged me to go and study, and that's why I did my psychology degree. Even when I had the children, it wasn't just a case of "that's your only thing you do." With my psychology degree, she felt I should perhaps look into doing further work with that. So it's very interesting. It was not this idea that people might get that we just sit at home and keep the household. We actually turn into the goddess with several arms.

Moderator: Multi-tasking.

Maureen: Exactly, exactly. Shri Mataji was the perfect example of that. One minute, as I say, cooking the dinner, the next minute giving lectures in a giant hall, travelling all over. People might say that if you're a householder, you don't move outside the house. She described that with Fatima, that she didn't go outside the house at that time. But she always encouraged us and helped us to fulfill ourselves.

This is the subtle thing that perhaps people miss. They feel that to be a good Gruha Lakshmi is a very subtle inner thing, not just cooking a meal or whatever it is. It's, as Grazyna was saying, that love, that concern. And really, it's putting yourself second, but not in a subservient way. Just as with a child, you wouldn't think, "Oh, I'm really tired. Why do I have to get up to this child?" Your first thought is, "What's wrong with the child?" however tired you are. It's that same thing. If for society you have that care, if you really care that much, then you are going to do your best to keep that balance for the society. And it so happens that women are good at it. Why not? We're given that power. And it's an extraordinary power. Men have different powers. I'm very happy not to have to go out and lift weights, or whatever it is. It's fascinating. We're like jigsaws; we fit together, but we're not the same.

Things like wearing a sari. I feel incredibly blessed to be a lady, to be able to wear a sari, as Shri Mataji did. I think people have lost the idea as to why that is important. It's, again, a subtle thing. A sari is a subtle protection that we wind around ourselves of pure material, and it protects us.

*

Moderator: As you've mentioned that, because increasingly now in collectives all over the world, be it India or abroad, the protocols are not being adhered to. You're going to worship the goddess in casual clothes sometimes.

Maureen: Yes, it's interesting. Because, again, for us, we were in front of Shri Mataji physically. She put my first sari on, as I've described in other things. From that first time, it felt so special. It's like your self-realization; it's something so subtle that words don't explain it. You have to feel it. When you put a sari on, you somehow immediately become slightly more dignified. I can remember seeing—we went to Navaratri and we were there for nine nights—a beautiful French girl. She wore saris every time. Then I saw her on the last day when she was in her normal European clothes, and somehow she looked completely different. She had lost that sort of universal look. I almost didn't recognize her because the sari gave her a special quality.

Grazyna: Punjabis. Shri Mataji said she wore Punjabis when she was a child.

Maureen: Yes. So from that, we can note that when you are no longer a child... They are very useful, great garments to wear for doing active things. Same protocol as a sari. So as you say, for being in Shri Mataji's presence at puja, which is how we feel, then there is a special reason for wearing that.

Moderator: And Punjabis, just for clarity's sake, in the Indian subcontinent, Punjabis are Salwar Kurta or Salwar Kameez.

Grazyna: Yes. Can I just add to this?

Moderator: Yes, please.

Grazyna: It depends why we're going to the puja. Because if we are going to worship the divine, what happens is we adorn the deities by wearing the sari. That's how it is. They immediately respond to that particular dress because it's the dress of the goddess. So it's a very subtle way of feeling it. We need to understand that if we want to benefit from the puja to get the blessings and the vibrations, wearing a sari could increase this. Sometimes we don't have a sari. This is not like a... but I think it's best to try to get a sari and wear a sari at pujas and see how you feel.

Maureen: Yes. It's something personal, the experience, isn't it?

Grazyna: Personal experience, exactly. It's very easy to get a sari now. For some countries it's not, and if for some countries it's not, that's different. Also, sometimes it's good to wear a beautiful dress if they cannot get a sari, like a beautiful, special dress just for this occasion. That's possible, like in Africa, for example, these beautiful dresses that they wear. It's traditional, something very traditional and beautiful. It all depends on you and your attitude and your feelings towards worshipping the goddess.

Moderator: Exactly. And sometimes probably the situation that the people are in. For example, there's unrest in certain parts of the world, and it's not possible then to wear a sari. But wherever possible, as you said, it is... because it also shows the effort we make, not just on a superficial but on a subtle level, recognizing who Shri Mataji is and preparing ourselves to receive those vibrations and offer her the puja so she accepts it, isn't it?

Grazyna: And I just wanted to say that silk and cotton...

Moderator: Yes.

Grazyna: ...would be, if possible—not always possible, but sort of mixed material maybe—but natural materials are better.

Moderator: Because the natural materials absorb...

Grazyna: Absorb vibrations, yes. Don't stop the vibrations.

Felicity: Yes. I did see Shri Mataji—I think particularly if you're going up for the Devi Puja as a woman, that does need to be a sari because I saw Mother turn people away who weren't coming up like that. There's something very deeply auspicious and important about wearing a sari. We used to take extras when we went to pujas in our collective in case there was a new person there who didn't have a sari, so we could share or give to them. I think this is nice, to think ahead like that.

I did have an experience when I had my third child that I was feeding. We were going to a small puja in a small ashram, only about 30 people. I felt, "Oh, I'm just really tired." The effort to put a sari on... I just... "I'll take it with me." I got there and I didn't put it on. I sat down and we started the puja, and I started to feel really uncomfortable. I just couldn't relax. Finally, I thought, "Is this because I need to wear a sari? I think I'm going to have to get up." So in the middle of the puja—I was at the back, or I guess we were a quarter way into it—I got up, went in the bedroom, put on my sari, came back, and sat down. As soon as I sat down, the vibrations came up, everything relaxed. So for me, this was an important lesson. Wherever I was, I should be wearing a sari because I knew better.

Moderator: Well, also at some point, it's important to mention here possibly that Shri Mataji advised that as ladies, as yoginis, all girls, we have to dress in a dignified way, which means we are not exposing our chakras. Is there any reflection on that from yourselves?

Maureen: Well, very much that the Shri Chakra... on both sides, the Shri Lalita and the Shri Chakra, shouldn't really be exposed on the shoulders.

Grazyna: It's also exposed because it's the Nabhi Chakra. So...

Maureen: The interesting thing is, who are we pleasing? Are we pleasing ourselves? Not really. Who are we following? Are we following ourselves? Shri Mataji has talked quite a bit about the fact that it's what she calls "entrepreneurs" coming up with new ideas, like the whole ripped trousers thing. I know it's my age, but I still see someone with ripped trousers and think, "You have paid someone to rip your trousers and then you've paid money for it." It's astounding how it's the emperor's new clothes, how people can be fooled, literally, into thinking this looks good. It's about confidence in yourself, that you don't need to follow a trend. It's particularly challenging for young people and teenagers.

Felicity: And I do remember—I hope this is not out of line to share this—but I do remember one time Shri Mataji came to America, to L.A., and we'd heard that a lot of the mums or people in the collective were upset because of the way the young people were dressing, the young yuvas. And actually, Shri Mataji supported the yuvas. She just said, "They're okay. Leave them to me. I'll sort them out."

So, as with most things, we should apply these things to ourselves and not be judging others for the way they are dressing. I think it's so important that we know these things and Shri Mataji shares these protocols and these understandings with us, but it doesn't give us the right to judge others who aren't necessarily following that, because we don't know their circumstances. We don't know what they're working out. But if we understand that and we feel this is what we want to do to follow what Mother said, that's important.

Maureen: Well, I had a little story like that whereby at the end of a program, a girl dressed in jeans and a top came and gave Mother a flower. I kind of went, "She's coming like that up to Mother," judging her, basically. Then later, I learned that this lady had come all the way from somewhere like Russia and she had never seen Shri Mataji in person like that; she'd only seen her from the back of a football stadium. It was all she had. But she had her flower and she just wanted to give it to Mother. So, sometimes, as you say, it's not the dress at that point. People's hearts are there. This is getting that balance.

Felicity: This is what I really learned from Shri Mataji. She responded to people's hearts. I saw one puja we were sitting in—I think it was a Diwali puja in Ganapatipule. After the puja, the gift-giving had started. The world leaders came on with the specially bought gift for Shri Mataji that I think she might even have chosen herself, a very beautiful necklace. It must have had diamonds or something; it was a really special necklace. It was offered to Mother, they came up, they offered it, Mother sort of gave a glance and then it moved on.

Then some other gifts were offered. And then this young woman came up and she knelt in front of Shri Mataji. She had this little glass wand figurine. As she leant towards Mother to give this, Shri Mataji came alive and bent down and was so effusive. "Beautiful this is, and where did it come from?" And you could see the heart of this yogini just open and melt. And I just went, "Shri Mataji knows what's in her heart." She's not responding at all to the quality of the gift; she's responding to the heart with which it was given. I feel that is something that I imbibed as a Lakshmi: it's not what is given, but how it's given, that is so important. I really learned that from Shri Mataji.

*

Felicity: I wanted to share about some particular talks that really helped me a lot. In the beginning, as a wife, I understood Mother's inspirations and teachings to be that I should be like the sort of subservient Indian wife. We would be held up with this model of what an Indian wife was like, and that didn't seem to be really working for me. After about seven years, I was a bit confused as to the balance and exactly how I should be. I went to Europe and was part of a Shri Fatima puja in 1988 on the border of Switzerland and Italy. That was such an incredible talk. Shri Mataji talks for over an hour about the roles of men and women. She was so funny and humorous.

I remember this story particularly. She tells one or two stories, and one is... I remember very early on thinking, "Oh, it's easy for Mother to be a Gruha Lakshmi, a good wife. She has a perfect marriage." But no, she played out these little mayas with her family for us to see how to be a Lakshmi in challenging situations, when your relatives aren't behaving as nicely as you would like them to. In this talk, she also talks about how her husband is insisting on planting a certain kind of tree. He says, "Oh, it's this tree," and she knows it's not that, it's actually a mango tree or something. But she just doesn't say anything. The way she tells the story, it's like it's not important to be right, it's not important to correct him. It'll all work out, as it does. Eventually, the tree grows and they go, "Oh my goodness, it's actually such and such a tree."

Something fundamental changed in me after listening to that, after being there in that puja and hearing this talk. I remember feeling, "Oh, we don't have to be the same. It's okay." I was confused because my husband would react to things differently from me. I was like, "Well, how should I react then? I'm feeling this, he's feeling that." In that talk, I felt Mother showing us that we are different. For me, from that talk, I understood that my role is the moral dharma in the family. And that if I need to take a stand, I should hold on to that, that is important. The other things are not so important. I feel that is a very supportive, pivotal talk for men and particularly women.

There is another talk that she gave called "The Role of Women" in Ganapatipule. There she addresses the right. What she says is that you can do anything as a woman. If you want to have a career, you are a career person, but do it as a woman. Still have your Lakshmi qualities emanating, because that is what is going to make you successful.

Maureen: There was also a talk in Shuddhikama, "Role of Women." Very important.

Moderator: I think we'll put the links to all these talks of Shri Mataji on empowering women so we can have some more firsthand information from Shri Mataji herself while you share your stories.

*

Maureen: You were saying about the chariot, the two wheels of the chariot. She must have talked to us in those kinds of ways early on a lot. She really said that it would be personally very boring if you were exactly the same, which is quite a unique way of looking at it, but it's true. She said if you were both there doing exactly, "Oh yes, let's do this," it just doesn't work. It's the same thing as the two wheels of the chariot. If the wheels are all going close together, they're going to tangle up and the chariot is going to fall over. So it was very much that you have your role and you keep your roles, and in those roles, you manage to keep the whole thing moving. You muddle up the roles, and it can get very difficult to have a smooth relationship.

Moderator: Yes, and it's not that easy though, is it, in these days and times to have that quiet, silent power of love with all the self-respect? Like what Felicity mentioned, the Indian wife being subservient.

Felicity: Hardly anyone's subservient these days, Felicity, in modern India. But I had to say it, because although I was from that part of the world...

Maureen: It's interesting because, as you say, how to do it... but it's actually incredibly relaxing if you don't feel that you have to constantly put yourself forward. To keep your counsel and to use it sensibly. Because if you're both putting forward, "Ah, yes, but..." Like you were saying about the tree, it will grow and it will be obvious. There are times when it's much more relaxing to keep that comment or that forceful action and just let it go, because you know eventually the thing will work out. It's a wise place to come from. It's that wisdom, I think, that we have to grow as ladies within us.

Felicity: And to be patient. To be patient with oneself, because it takes time for you and your husband to get to know each other. Allow yourself the time to grow and change and understand that, okay, maybe I'm not there yet, but this is a quality I'd like to develop. And over time, if you have that desire, it will.

Grazyna: I also feel every situation is different. Every marriage is different. Every husband is different. There's no set rule in a marriage, because sometimes you have to put yourself forward. You got to be strong. It just depends on the situation. But basically, whatever the woman does, she has to be strong. She cannot be like a tree that's just about to collapse. She has to make herself strong through the example of Mother and through the care that she has to give to everyone, because without that, the family may collapse and everything can be quite difficult.

So even if she feels sometimes depressed—because quite often I hear yoginis say they don't feel well, they feel like this and like that—they have to pull themselves together and just carry on, really, because there is no other choice. I remember Shri Mataji was saying also if women would be in charge of the world, they would do this very well because the world would be their house. And they will want to put everything right, everything working together in a harmonious and beautiful way. So hopefully, the caring attitudes and the attitude that we need to create harmony and no conflict should be the guiding star for yoginis to follow.

Maureen: And keep a sense of humor.

Moderator: Yes, definitely. A sense of humor and everything within reason, in balance, like Shri Mataji has shown by example. There's nothing to be taken to an extreme, whether it is bearing up with patience and tolerance. If something needs correcting, then it needs correcting. So tough love, especially in terms of bringing up children or relationships sometimes. If you have to say something, then you do convey it, but it's how it's done, with the heart, that makes a difference, isn't it?

Felicity: And not to make dramas. She said that to me at one point, "Don't create dramas in your mind, in yourself. It's a play, it's a maya." I think sometimes in the West, we make things seem a lot more important. I remember seeing a young Indian woman getting married. I remember saying to her, "Oh, how's it going?" or something, and I realized that she was so normal and balanced and detached. "Yeah, this is my husband and we're just going to get on with it and be married." And I went like, "Oh, an enlightened way of looking at things," because I was coming from the West where everything is sort of emotional and romantic ideas.

Moderator: Lovely. Let me share now, if we could. So if you would take a chance to please talk about these photos. Is it visible?

All: Yes.

Grazyna: I don't know about this one. You see lots of tomatoes in there. There's a huge big pan. Some sort of seminar. I love how she has put the tea towel as an apron too.

Maureen: Fabulous. She used to wear an apron as well, quite often. She would just organize yogis to cook, tell them what to do. When I first came, I remember at Dollis Hill Ashram, she was cooking for us. She was cooking her favorite chicken. She was asking us, "You have to chop that much garlic, that much onion, and you have to add the spices." So she was actually telling us what to do and how to cook.

Felicity: When Shri Mataji made dal, she put so much butter in it. So much. She said, "I know some people say, but really it has to be."

Moderator: Oh, that's good to know.

Maureen: And it was always a lot. You have huge pots with everything.

[Next photo]

Grazyna: So it's like a birthday cake, isn't it? It is. Must be Shri Mataji's birthday cake.

Maureen: It's the declaration. It's the 2nd December 1979. That's what the title is.

Grazyna: Oh, 1979. Okay. It's definitely Dollis Hill.

Felicity: It is Dollis Hill, yes. She actually got those miracle lights that were taken. You can see it in the foreground as well, the vibrations. A series of photos were taken at that time showing the lights in Mother. Amazing.

[Next photo]

Maureen: Oh, what a beautiful photo. Of course, we have a book with Shri Mataji's recipes.

Grazyna: Yes, Cooking with Love.

Maureen: Yes. And that's what she was doing always, cooking with love. That is a very interesting point. When you eat food that has been cooked with love, it has such a different feel. You feel so satisfied. It's vibrated. And if you ate food that Shri Mataji cooked, it was just so deeply satisfying. I must say, if you go to restaurants, the food doesn't taste the same. It can be very good quality and everything, but you can feel that there is something missing.

[Next photo]

Grazyna: Now Shri Mataji is making barfis in this one. Can anyone identify where this is?

Felicity: This is Brompton Square Kitchen.

Moderator: Wow. She hosted quite a few diplomatic dinners, didn't she?

Maureen: Both at Ashley Gardens and in Brompton Square. And she was a very hands-on cook, even though she had a cook as well.

Grazyna: It seems to me the same sari that Shri Mataji is wearing in Scotland in the fishing photo.

Felicity: Possibly. You cannot really see the sari very well right now.

Maureen: I'm just looking at the pattern, the little we can see, and it reminds me of that photo. What would Shri Mataji wear when there wasn't a puja or a function? What sort of sari would she wear?

Grazyna: She would always, very often wear a white silk sari for a public program usually. Except for the Exeter TV interview, Shri Mataji didn't wear a white sari. This was very unusual because there was a puja just before and she didn't have time to change. Though she wanted to change, the yogis who were with her were saying, "No, no, we don't have enough time." But there was plenty of time, because when she arrived, something was canceled and people had plenty of time to get realization. So she was wearing this beautiful puja sari in the studio during the TV interview. This was the only time, probably.

Moderator: It's really very nice to have these photos and to hear your experiences from those lovely, lovely times. Is there any incident that comes to your mind or any advice that Shri Mataji gave you personally that you'd like to share very quickly before we wrap up?

Felicity: She told me not to be critical. I had two experiences where, one, she was telling me the situation of a wife and she kept saying, "And she makes all these critical comments. What do you think?" She kept saying to me, "And she says this and this, and what do you think?" And finally I realized Mother's telling me this for a reason, I mustn't be critical.

Then, when I got married, the next morning we were having breakfast together, just sitting quietly at the table. Suddenly all these critical thoughts just kept jumping in my head, "Oh, he says this and this and this." But because Mother had given me this warning, in a way, I just thought, "Don't say anything. Keep your mouth closed." It was such a strong... it must have been some kind of negativity that was just trying to create disharmony. I just kept my mouth shut the whole time, and then it just went away.

Moderator: Good on you. Thank you, Felicity. Maureen, Grazyna?

Grazyna: Nothing at this moment.

Moderator: That's fine. I think we have sort of touched the essence of Shri Mataji as the perfect Gruha Lakshmi. Thank you so much for taking your time out this evening for this session. It's just so nice to see you all and to rejoice in Shri Mataji's blessings. Thank you so much for joining us.

All: Thank you so much.
