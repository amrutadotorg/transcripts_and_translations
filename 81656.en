 (England)
Hello, Jayshree Mataji. Welcome to our Sahaj Golden Writers podcast. I am Rohan, joining here from England, and with me is my co-host Aunty Felicity, joining us from England as well; Brother Rishi, joining us from America; and Brother Raghava, joining us from Canada. Today we have a very special guest with us, Uncle Pat, and along with him is his wife, Aunty Gresna. We're going to talk about his two books, Expecting to Fly and Space Time. So hello, everyone. How are you?

Exciting to be here. Thank you.

I feel like this is such a special podcast because we have so many people from all over. A very big welcome, Gresna and Pat. Thank you for joining us. We are looking forward to hearing about your inspiration for writing both your books, Expecting to Fly and Space Time. Would you like to just start by sharing a few facts about yourself and your life?

Sure. I was born in Hong Kong, the eldest of four siblings. Up till the age of 10, I was raised in the United States. After settling permanently in England, I spent six years in two Catholic boarding schools and then two years of art college. Following an ill-fated marriage at age 19, I dropped out of college and worked in various jobs before becoming fully committed to spiritual seeking with hallucinogenic drugs.

I met Shri Mataji at a private gathering at a Hatha Yoga teacher's flat in London in 1975 at the age of 26. I joined a small group of seekers who worked with Shri Mataji for two years in London and in India before public meetings began at Caxton Hall. Right from these earliest times, Shri Mataji encouraged me to write a book for seekers who were taking drugs because that was my background, but I found it a difficult challenge to begin with.

My first attempt, Shri Mataji wasn't very impressed with while we were working in her house in Brompton Square, and the only copy was lost and vanished. But Shri Mataji said, "Never mind, you can write another one." I took this as an indication that I wasn't mature enough in Sahaja Yoga yet to complete the task. It was actually only quite some time later, when I started to have really deep, profound experiences spontaneously in Sahaja Yoga, that I was truly inspired to write the book.

Would you like to share some of those experiences at this point?

I can try. I did have a whole series of experiences when I first met Shri Mataji, which are also in the book, but they sort of died off after a while. I had to come down to earth and work on the basics instead of shooting off into the stratosphere. This took place several years later, in the 80s.

So I'm just thinking, because you talked about losing the book in the house, look at some of the photos which show you working in the house with Shri Mataji.

Oh, yeah. So just, why don't you introduce the photos?

This is me, aged about five in Hong Kong. Such a sweetheart. No idea what was coming ahead.

This was soon after I first met Shri Mataji. It was actually in a box from above an Indian restaurant that belonged to some of Shri Mataji's relatives in Weston-super-Mare. In this photo—there's a whole series of photos, actually—in which Shri Mataji was trying to get me to smile, because at that point, I was very serious about everything.

Well, she managed. I can see a smile.

Yes. Another time, she did that. She hung her bangles on my ears. She had a tremendous sense of humor, Shri Mataji. She did like to make us laugh and have a light atmosphere.

And what's the next one?

This is outside Brompton Square. I'm sort of in the middle of the door, and there are a few other people who were working there. Lots of us were working there.

So you are part of this group, the Golden Builders, that Shri Mataji sort of trained, I would say, in a way. On her house.

Yeah, I guess so.

So these series of photos are around the time that you were writing the first draft.

First started, yeah.

And just out of interest, can you talk us through the plastering photos that are coming up?

That's me, working on one of the molds. Shri Mataji made a lot of the things; ideas she'd come up with spontaneously. Some we bought, classic molds from ornamental architecture. One we made from a biscuit tin with embossed roses in it, which we built up an original with and made molds from that. And another one was the side of a coffee table which we made molds from.

Oh my goodness, like an ornate carving.

Yes, yes, all those sort of things. And of course, later on when they were up—a lot of them were put up by John Watkinson—into the cornicing of the walls and ceilings. And then we painted a lot of them with all sorts of gold, all sorts of colors.

So while you were working in Mother's House like this, you were having... obviously it was going side by side with meditation and meditation experiences and being in her physical presence, which must have been very inspiring in itself.

Yeah, and a lot of fun. It was hard work, but it was a lot of fun. There was always something going on. I remember I arrived early for work one day because it was just a building site. No one was living in Mother's House. I went in the house and Shri Mataji was already there, sitting by herself. So I thought, oh, I'm going to get the spotlight treatment.

She said, "How are you, Pat?" I tried to be a bit upbeat. And she said, "Put your hands towards me and see what vibrations you're feeling." The only thing I could think of, well, I said, "They're a bit warm, Shri Mataji." And she said, "Oh, well, you need some warmth in this country." There were lots of little things like that. So sweet.

And so you said earlier, she asked you to write this book to help young people not take drugs, to share...

Well, to young people who were getting lost in drugs. There were an awful lot of people getting into all kinds of trouble taking drugs. The whole ethos of the movement changed a lot. It started off with, "all you need is love," and gradually disintegrated into some quite dark scenarios, really. And people were getting lost, becoming very cynical, very disillusioned.

The whole thing about drugs is that they'll fling you up into a high, but then you might see and experience all kinds of things, but then you'll come down again. There's no way to get there. And I realized that Sahaja Yoga that Shri Mataji was teaching was the missing link, that you needed to climb the ladder and start experiencing such things—and much better things—spontaneously and naturally, in a more consistent way.

As I was reading, you describe in a lot of detail the different hallucinogenic experiences, the highs that you had, especially initially, before the lows and the destruction of your body kind of came about. And you mentioned then after getting realization and after meditating and meeting Shri Mataji, you then start to have different, deeper kind of spiritual experiences.

Yes, much later.

And so it was these later experiences that inspired you to then, after the book was initially lost, to rewrite a new book.

To start the book again, yeah.

Would you like to read now, maybe, some of the...

I can do. I can read some of them. I'm not the world's greatest reader, but I'll have a go.

My feelings have come back to life in a way that I've not felt since my youth. They are so intense that at times I find it hard to believe that friends I've not seen for 20 or 30 years are not about to walk in the door.
I feel that this is a real manifestation of Sahaja Yoga, the full potential that Shri Mataji has always talked about. The kundalini and the chakras have gone into action like a dynamic, well-lubricated machine, and vibratory awareness has suddenly become amazing. I can feel everything in my own and in other people's chakras with what seems like digital precision. At work, I find it hard to concentrate on what people are saying to me because I'm so fascinated on them. Mantras work like magic, the primordial cadence of the Sanskrit language at one with the energy of the subtle system. I can hear the power resonating in my voice as I speak, the sound echoing back from the walls of the room as the words rip through time and space and penetrate deeper realities beyond. I need only utter a single mantra to release a flood of vibrations that propel me deep into meditation for hours.
I've been trying to drive a car through slippery mud for years and have suddenly struck firm, dry tarmac. I have only to put my foot down to accelerate with all the power I could wish for.
Deeply profound experiences occur without warning. I sit in front of Shri Mataji's photograph and the bottom half of my body becomes instantly cool. A moment later, the top half is completely cool. Kundalini rising and it ascends like a broad, majestic, royal golden cobra. As it touches the top of my head, I touch eternity and the wall of thoughtless awareness descends. The state of meditation is rock solid, the detachment absolute, as if the whole world is suspended in glass. I feel I could rap on it and it would ring like steel. I can step back out of my body and stand in the land of the father, of Allah, of Sadashiva. It's absolutely awesome.
I walk around a DIY store and it is as if a portal into a higher world has materialized in the air above me. It is a dimension of blissful existence straight out of the Sundari Lahiri, the flood of beauty, an ancient Sanskrit work describing the qualities of the goddess. I feel an immaculate, soft, golden-white purity within me, the presence of Ganesha. I perceive my subtle system as a ladder I need to climb up to this paradise, my body a temporary necessity to be left behind when I reach it.
I feel a sort of luminous, blissful umbrella open over the top of my head, golden and lustrous with vibrant color, as though infused with living gems. A slow, broad river of vibrations is flowing up my spine and the top of my head suddenly opens out so wide it seems to turn itself inside out in the most unbelievable way. Immediately I become part of a vast ocean of the Holy Spirit that floods out of me in a great tide. It is almost like a scene from a comedy movie in which someone opens a door in a house filled with water, except that it is an absolutely profound and glorious experience. I am one with the essence of Shri Mataji's personality in an outpouring of spirit that flows deep into the eyes of those around me and passes on into eternity.
I am walking along the pavement near my house and I feel an intoxicating joy begin to permeate my being. It is as if the whole world is saturated with bliss and it is seeping into me through all the pores of my skin. I feel totally ecstatic just to exist and the everyday scene of the street where I live is transformed into a place on earth. As I place the key in the lock of my front door, I feel I am a character in a magical fairy tale, living a perfect, utterly fulfilled existence.
Deep in sleep, I dream of a great mountain of bliss. It is a great eternal flame, luminous, blissful, incandescent with cool white fire. It is the absolute promise of immortality. I cry out and run to place my hands at the foot of the mountain. It is pure divine love and my hands become infused to its surface. A miraculous power flows into my arms, transforming the molecules of my being into a blissful, divine substance. I am instantly wide awake and sit bolt upright in bed, yelling in excitement.

There's a lot more of these experiences in the book. And since I wrote the book, I have continued to record them as they happen on the Facebook page for Expecting to Fly. I'd just like to slowly, just briefly read the last experience, the latest one, which is certainly the best I've ever had.

You flood my being with luminous bliss, bathe bruised heart and mind, and tenderly cleanse the last speck of madness. All thought has fled, deep ease now absolute. You light the lamp of adoration and pour your fabulous beauty into the bottomless well within, that it may overspill and quench the thirst of many.

Uncle, the way you describe these experiences... I was trying to find a way to describe it myself, and then you said it, and that's exactly what it is. You described the mechanism of Sahaja Yoga so beautifully and in so much detail that there's just so much truth pouring out of it. It's so unique. Thank you so much.

You can't help being a bit inspired if that kind of thing is going on. I had to write the book.

Wow. And I just felt how much love and care Shri Mataji had. She was so concerned for the young people getting into drugs and destroying themselves. By giving you these incredible experiences, and you recording them in the book, it's a way to show them this is not the way. Drugs are not the way. You are a living testament that you can have these incredible...

Yeah. If you're lucky. It takes a long time. And this is a long process, but I've had on and off experiences. I guess many yogis have, on and off over the years.

I would say key to yours is the desire. You can see that when you read of your seeking through drugs, you had such a pure desire to connect to the divine, to something beautiful, something pure.

Well, that's true. What drugs did was to show me, open my eyes a bit, that something was there. I mean, LSD can show you that you have fabulous dimensions of being hidden within you. But as I said, what it can't do is show you how to achieve them permanently. And not only that, but it opens you up to all kinds of risks.

Yes, very much so. And I describe that in the book as well. There are all kinds of dimensions of existence which you don't necessarily need to go prospecting in. You need to go up the main lift to the top floor, not get lost backstage or in the engineering room or whatever. There's all kinds of stuff that can be very dangerous. So I've been very lucky to survive that.

And as far as Mother's help and care, she looked after us so well. It was just incredible. My friend Gus collapsed in the street with hepatitis. He was at the end of his tether completely. And when she saw him, she put him in her car and took him home and kept him there for six weeks, working on him and looking after him, nursing him back to health. She lived in quite a posh environment. Her husband was the secretary general of the International Maritime Organization, and he was quite horrified when she walked up with this guy. And he was quite horrified at the rest of us too, but he was very patient. We all got looked after so well and with so much care for years and years.

Your reading of your spiritual experience was just mind-blowing, and hard to come up with words after that. But I'd love to hear some other responses from Raghava or Rohan.

Yeah, I mean, I can say there's a lot of things bubbling in my attention from the reading and the book in general. I was refreshing myself earlier today; it had been about 12 years since I looked at the book significantly. It's funny because the passage you read was one that I happened upon while I was leafing through the book.

One thing that is really sticking out to me most right now is, as you said, there's a lot of experiences you had on LSD before meeting Shri Mataji, and then very strong experiences just when you met her. And then in the book, and as you also described now, there was a coming-back-to-earth moment and maybe a period of time where those weren't so many or so significant, as the structure was built to get back up to that point in a more stable and steady way. And then those experiences came again. For the purposes of the book being a signpost for weary travelers not to get lost, how can you compare those experiences you had early on—that were this big jump to this height and then a fall down afterwards—to the ones you had later, after you had built that spiritual framework?

They were very, very different. LSD was a bit like breaking into the back door of a temple and wandering around in the dark, seeing amazing things and not really understanding them. With Shri Mataji, it was like being invited into the temple at the main entrance and shown everything with all the lights on. It was very, very different.

But the drug experiences showed you something was there to be found, something really deep and profound existing in humanity. It created a platform for the book, because it showed that something was there, and then I could try and find a way how to establish it, how to make sense of it all. But as I also described in the book, I had a really bad trip. And that experience which I read out just now, the last one, was the moment when I felt that splinter come out of the deepest part of my heart that struck me down on that occasion. And it's taken me 48 years to recover. It was very deep and dangerous.

Oh, absolutely. It sounded like touching the gates of hell.

It was. It was something straight from hell. And it takes a long time to put things right. Everyone who gets involved in drugs gets into problems sooner or later and they eventually give them up, mostly. Or they just go into total self-destruct. Some of them have the kind of spectacular fall that I did. I got shot down and went round and round like this plane just shot out of the sky, going down and down and down. It was awful. I don't know how I survived it, to be honest. I don't know how I kept going. I was quite mad to keep going for that couple of years it took me to find Shri Mataji after that. I don't know what I was expecting—a miracle. And I found one. I didn't deserve one, certainly not from anything I'd done in this life, that's for sure.

But Shri Mataji said she didn't think I'd live another six months. I was just living on barbiturates and Mars bars, basically. But she so loved her miracles. She loved to say, "Look at Pat," or, "See how he's come up through Sahaja Yoga. See how this has saved him." And I think for her to be able to show the limitless power of the Sahaja Yoga meditation, of Kundalini awakening, how it can heal anything... and you're a living example of that. Although, as you said, it takes time when your psyche and your being is so damaged. One has to be patient.

You don't realize just how primitive a level society is at. You get exposed to all kinds of things that are bad for your subtle system just going through everyday life, and it does take a long time. All this stuff you pick up growing up takes a long time to work out. But the reward at the end of the trail is well worth it, to put it mildly.

It reminds me of the analogy that Shri Mataji always said about the mud and the lotus coming out of the mud.

Yeah, it's true. There was a lot of mud about, that's for sure.

I know one of the reasons that we invited Raghava on the podcast...

Yeah, there was something I can say about that. It was an interesting experience for me rereading the book a little bit just now because the first time I read it, I only read the first half up until you met Shri Mataji. I was so struck by that that I was satisfied and I put the book down. I was probably 14 or something when I read that.

I think what struck me the most was, I felt in that moment, despite whatever problems I have vibrationally that I need to work out, at least I didn't have to go through this. I'm floundering in the ocean, but I can see that there's a rope above me. I didn't have to be in that ocean of ignorance seeking out a rope, getting tossed by the waves. Of course, being someone born in Sahaja Yoga, I still have to build that structure to get to those higher experiences and that higher state of yourself. But I didn't have to go through this just desperate, blind seeking of something sublime because I was blessed enough to be born with it in my life. Just to even have that lighthouse on the horizon. It really made me appreciate how helpless seekers without that must feel.

I recall a passage from the book, near the beginning, where you were describing standing in your hometown and looking up at the stars on a late night and just being completely lost as to what the direction and purpose of your life was.

That was in London, Euston Station. Yeah, that was a low moment, that's for sure. I had a lot of them. I had a really, really hard time. But I met an awful lot of seekers and some beautiful, lovely people, and I could see they were all getting lost and damaged. Another thing that inspired me to write Expecting to Fly was, I was thinking of people like that, who are searching and who are really getting lost and are not even realizing they're getting lost because there's so much going on in the guru realm. There are so many false gurus around and so much stuff going on that's actually damaging the seekers. I felt that in the beginning. I thought, right, well, I'm not sure what this is, but I'm going to find out for sure. And if it's what I think it is, I'm going to tell everyone. I didn't really think I was likely to be able to salvage myself because I thought I was too badly damaged, but I thought at least I might be able to salvage some other people.

If I can just continue on this train slightly, it's interesting you're saying that, because as I was reading the book today, friends of mine or seekers I'd met kept coming into my attention. There was one point where you were describing Shri Ganesha and I remembered a seeker I met at a festival in England who had seen Shri Ganesha after they had overcome cancer, and they also felt a very strong experience with the realization. And I thought of a friend I had who actually does LSD and has come to Sahaj a bit. I've repeatedly told him about what the book is basically about, and he gets it. He said to me once, "I'm just going the easy route. You're doing the hard work. I'm trying to shortcut it right now."

Something I was really impressed by reading the book again today was how so exactly and concisely it seems to capture the precedence of what this happening is. Particularly one chapter that I think was titled "Ghosts in the Machine." I love that chapter because I felt it was summarizing so much of what Shri Mataji talks about on a metaphysical level of this evolutionary process and how these basically dead things existing in the superconscious and the subconscious are dragging back on this evolutionary spearhead that is led by seekers. It felt like such a powerful summary and also translated into a way that the material mind could understand and not react to in the same way that sometimes Mother's words directly can trigger your ego or your conditionings. It even made me feel like, wow, I'm working in a Sahaja school right now, I'm surrounded by Sahaja Yoga, but I was reading it and thinking, I feel like I've lost the message a bit. I'm a little bit in this mesh of material stuff and I'm forgetting the springboard that you can always go to—a subtler and a softer level of the heights.

Is Gresna there?

She's just wandering around upstairs somewhere... I just wanted to say, I have been involved in the book from the very beginning. It was very difficult for my husband to even write the book because he had to work. He used to travel to London, and he was writing the book in his spare time after work and at the weekends. So it took some time.

After reading it—because I had to proofread, of course, he showed me what he had written—I was quite amazed because I didn't know about all these experiences with drugs that he had. I didn't know he took so many drugs. I was quite horrified. I don't know if I had known...

So was my mother.

Your poor mother. So we were both horrified, actually. Then she said, "I didn't know I had such an adventurous son." But she was very proud of the book. In her nineties, she had all these friends also in their eighties and nineties, and she would send the book to her friends, these old ladies. I don't know if they could understand anything.

It's astonishing. I asked her, "Well, what did you ever hear anything back from them?" And she said, "No."

I think that many yogis' seeking and their understanding of Sahaja Yoga were transformed by reading the book. So was mine. In fact, especially if they were new, they said they could understand what the goal of the whole thing was, of their meditation, what was the purpose of it. Because sometimes in Sahaja Yoga, you can get lost in superficiality.

You're right. It's like Pat has had these experiences to open the door, open the window to show us. As a seeker, you're looking, you want oneness with God, you want to feel something beautiful, but you don't quite know what that might look like. Except when you were reading your beautiful experience, the first one, I just kept seeing visions of Blake's paintings. It's like you put into words and your experiences the things that he touched on in his artwork. And then you filled this world with your experience, which was so beautiful.

It's funny because even we, in meditation, desire to become the spirit, but what does it mean? People don't experience that. When you read about all these experiences, you actually realize what it means to. And maybe in a way that paves the way a little bit so that when you start to feel things, one's not shocked. You can flow into it, you can enjoy it. So that's a real gift that you've given us, Pat, by sharing those things.

The only thing that's missing is to be able to really share them with other yogis. I'm just dying for that to happen.

I hate to use the word "long-suffering wife," but I know it's not so easy when you're supporting your husband's passions.

No, no, I'm not a long-suffering wife. I'm just so glad that I have been married to a saint.

She doesn't say that when she wants me to do the washing up.

The thing is, you have to be balanced. Washing up is very balancing. I am really glad because I have grown a lot through being married to Pat. The intensity that he has in his seeking—still seeking the spirit, not being satisfied that, "oh, I am an old yogi." He still says, "I haven't achieved what I should achieve." He's surrendering, he's meditating a lot and surrendering every minute to the divine to guide him. I wish I was that intense, actually.

I'd like to ask, after publishing the book, did any of your friends or someone come up to you and say they want to be in Sahaj, just from your experience?

No, not really. Some yogis did. My other old friends didn't quite know what to make of it, I guess. There have been people who have written to me from different parts of the world who said that it's made a big difference, that it's come into their life at a certain time that's been very helpful to them. And that's great. I'm really pleased about that. But I don't know what most writers are like, but I just want to write and not have to appear and talk about it. I'm not someone who likes performing in public.

We're very grateful that you came to join us. I just wanted to share that this book is so much more than the drug experiences. It has so many layers. It's such a complex, layered book. It's autobiographical; you literally go from the beginning of your life to 2011-12, when you published it. But it also covers the history and evolution of the Sahaja Yoga movement because you were right there. In your travels, in your working on the houses where Shri Mataji lived and being with her, you moved from Brompton Square, then to Cambridge, then to Cabella, then to Pratisthan in India. So you got to see and feel firsthand the global collective changes that were happening with Sahaja Yoga.

Then you share in the book these personal experiences with Shri Mataji, these deep spiritual experiences, the highs and lows of extreme drug use. And I had no idea you were such a good writer, Pat. You are a very good...

I wasn't a writer. It was the experience, that kind of experience that turns you into an artist of some kind. I wasn't before that at all. That's probably another reason why Shri Mataji wasn't impressed with my first edition.

So you had no experience with writing before that?

I used to write amateur novels at school. That was about it. No, I was a plumber. I worked in the building trade and I was a hippie. I had very little formal education, really. That all came from having deeper experiences. Occasionally I pick up Expecting to Fly and I'll read a bit and I think, wow, did I write that? It wrote itself.

Well, you've got amazingly beautiful visual imagery. And within the book, you actually explain about the Kundalini, self-realization, the chakras in a very informal, nice manner. It just sort of suddenly you're in a chapter and you've explained a little bit more. You talk about the archetypes and Hindu mythology, the divinities, and it's all contained within this book. On top of that, you've got all these philosophical reflections on the state of mankind and the beautiful possibilities and sharing the dream of spiritual evolution for humanity and reaching that inner peace.

Can I share? I bookmarked a part that I read from "Ghosts in the Machine" that I think... because we're talking about the writing right now, that was very powerful. It starts with Uncle Pat writing about accepting some of the teachings Shri Mataji is sharing about the superconscious, the subconscious, dead entities, anti-evolutionary forces.

It was accepting that we were vulnerable to subtle intrusions by destructive psychic entities and that we were on the firing line of a conflict between positive evolutionary forces and everything that was stale and outdated in nature. Shri Mataji portrayed the Kali Yuga, the age of spiritual darkness of Hindu tradition as a long twilight in the quality of consciousness in which the ingrained habits of the past cast their shadows over each bright new generation, deadening and shrouding its subtleties. It was within this ancient landscape that she portrayed the activities of these spirits, dissatisfied shades of the past, perpetuating the status quo by seeking to prolong their desires and obsessions through the psyches of the living.

So in the modern age, especially now, with mental health issues being very commonly spoken about, it's such a powerful way of putting those things in perspective. It almost made me feel at certain points like I was reading good science fiction, the science fiction that is seeking in nature. It's like you're giving explanations for a lot of things that people don't understand, the confusion.

Thank you, Pat, for writing such a brave, humble, sincere, and honest book and taking the time, because we understand it takes a lot of time to bring a book to fruition.

So speaking of science fiction, let's talk about Space Time.

Space Time is a very different book from Expecting to Fly. I started writing it when I retired to give me something to do. It's an attempt to interest seekers. It's not super scientific; it's about time travel, but it's got a spiritual theme. I just hope that it may communicate with some seekers who might enjoy it and might be interested. Some of the experiences I talk about in the book are actually realities of experience. So they're not really imaginary, but they don't know that. Okay, so I'll just read you a section from it. This is from a bit where the protagonist is lost in the American Civil War, trying to figure out what's going on when he doesn't really understand much at all.

"We must make a run for it," I urged. "I don't think there's anyone else in the house."
She nodded, wide-eyed. The door was unlocked and the corridor empty. We got to the entrance and peered out of the front door. Soldiers were in sight, but none were close by or looking in our direction. We stepped outside. It felt dangerously exposed and I forced myself to stay calm.
"This way," I suggested, indicating a direction further away from the town, behind the Confederate lines. I hoped we might pass beyond the long avenue of confrontation between the two armies and circle around to the northern side. We moved at a stumbling run, Jacqueline hampered by her long dress, I by my aching body. I flinched at the ear-splitting crack of cannon fire nearby. I could feel the pressure waves a hundred yards from the nearest Confederate battery, strangely more aware of the weight of atmosphere resisting the expanding gases than of the detonations themselves. I was nervous of returned Union fire too, though it was not extensive. Only a couple of cannonballs whipped high through the trees above us. The soldiers merely looked concerned as I nodded to them.
"This is no place for civilians," said one curtly, looking curiously at my clothes and the marks on my face. "You must go to the rear."
"My cousin has been injured," said Jacqueline, improvising gamely. "We are trying to get to my sister's house."
"She advises you to stay in the area, ma'am," replied the soldier. "The fighting is liable to get mighty hot."
I turned to her as we hurried away. "You're good at this," I joked. "Are you sure you're not a spy?"
"I had to say something," she said sharply. "I didn't want them to hear your accent."
We spotted a sizable contingent of Confederate infantry in the distance, and this time waited behind a large thicket of bushes to let them march by. Then we continued to make our way south, to higher ground. We had gone a mile or two when the cannon fire died down, and soon afterwards the terrain brought us out into the open. We stood on the shallow upper slope of an exposed escarpment, which dropped away steeply below. It formed a great viewing platform, overlooking miles of the long, shallow depression in the land between the two armies.
Some distance below and to our left, a great body of Confederate infantry emerged from the trees. They moved purposefully across the cornfields towards the Union lines opposite, tramping steadily through the thinning smoke of the artillery barrage. The line grew longer as we watched. More and more men came into view, their ranks stretching far back along the wide valley towards the town. The dense files of men advanced in ragged formations, separate regiments treading behind sword-wielding officers on horses. They moved with ominous determination, sunlight glittering wickedly on thousands of bayonets up and down the line. From our vantage point they looked invincible, and I could only imagine how they appeared to the soldiers waiting across the valley.
"Oh no, how can they be withstood," gasped Jacqueline, her voice almost a whisper.
Yet I knew they would be repulsed, driven back with appalling casualties. We were looking at Pickett's doomed charge at the centre of the Union lines, the high watermark of the fortunes of the South, a harbinger of a downward spiral of decline and defeat. I shivered at the sight of so many men marching to their death. Once again I felt the touch of some deeper self, some mysterious silent witness of the dramas of humanity, watching the ages turn with timeless knowledge and indifference. A still and profound detachment settled on me, and I sensed the mindworm squirm. It feared this enigmatic state of being.
It came back to me what I had read years before. Everyone knew Oppenheimer's iconic quote from the Bhagavad Gita on witnessing the detonation of the atomic bomb: Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds. But I had looked it up and other lines had stuck in my mind too, for no apparent reason: I am time, world devouring, grown aged. All the warriors standing in the army of the enemies, they are already claimed by me. Such things had moved me in some profound and nameless manner, and then slipped away from any attempt to engage them. Was this what it was like to stand beyond time, I wondered, to watch fate unfold like an unescapable deep dream? And if this was a dream, how did I awake from it, and what did reality then become?
My trance-like state deepened, and I watched the battle unfold like a sad antique movie. Southern soldiers went down in scores, their comrades forging stubbornly ahead through a pitiless hail of destruction. Clouds of dirty white smoke billowed across the battlefield, whipped and beaten about by lethal swaths of metal, and the immense band of men marched into the thickening haze as if they were erasing themselves from the story of their lives. Raw courage and foolish bravado blurred in a dreamlike parody of human folly. Men formed up as if on parade, marking time and dressing left and right, to realign themselves with other regiments as bodies dropped in their ranks, and then shuffling up to fill the gaps. They looked like children playing a game whose consequences they did not understand, believing themselves invulnerable and their cause inviolate.
I started to become myself again, still disengaged, but more personally aware. Sensation returned to my battered body, and I remembered our own predicament. I glanced back along the way we had come, and saw distant figures riding in our direction, through the trees. They looked very much as if they might be searching for us.

Rishi, have you read this?

Yes, yes I have. What struck me is that, on the surface, Expecting to Fly and Space Time are completely different books, completely different genres. But then you have this subtle similarity, which is that both books are based on experience. And again, you're amazing at describing these experiences. How you describe the witness state in this section is absolutely something we can all relate to as Sahaja Yogis. Going into a meditation and coming out of it, and taking a while to come back. So, it's also a very, very deep book, because you have all of these commentaries on humanity and their direction. They're actually very similar books.

You visit so many times. It's a book about history and the future. You visit all these different places. I can only remember off the top of my head, the Civil War, Atlantis, high-tech India, Delhi in the future, Alexandria with its amazing library. I wanted to ask you how much research, because the historical places you take us...

A lot of research. Alexander, though... the thing about Alexander and the ancient library is nobody really knows much about it. So I had to make it all up from lots of different sources, really.

I'm struggling with the second volume at the moment. The trouble is, I've got so many threads that I'm trying to weave.

I was just going to ask about that, because it says "Book One of the Time Quest Chronicles." So are we going to get another one?

Yeah, I'm two-thirds of the way through it. The publisher is extremely annoyed with me because I've been a bit stuck. But I actually just got a new bit of inspiration this morning for the bit that I'm stuck on. So maybe that's good.

And could you talk a little bit about the time travel? I'm fascinated by the way you describe the portals. As Rishi said, there are connections to Expecting to Fly. You actually reference and talk about some of your experiences in Expecting to Fly.

Yeah. Well, of course. As I said, a lot of the experiences are based on actual experiences in other dimensions. So the idea is that you're sort of taking people towards that without them knowing it. And hopefully it will come together in the end. The experiences of time travel itself are pretty similar to experiences in meditation that I have had, or inspired by, at least.

Then you also have this theme of love in its different forms throughout the book that starts with the main character's carnal love relationship. And then throughout the book, you take him into a relationship which, as he learns to understand, is based on pure love of a higher plane. I thought that was really beautiful to contrast his experiences and his understanding of how love changes.

There's a goodie female and a baddie female. I got quite fond of the baddie one, really. I'm hoping that things work out for her in one way or another. But I've tried to do too much, really. Because I'm not a serious, classical writer. I don't have training. I don't have that kind of education. So I think I've tried to do a bit too much. But still, you can make it up and try and muddle through.

No, it's got lovely pacing. It's a really great adventure story and it's got so many different aspects and levels to it. I got nearly to the end the first time I read it, and I stopped reading because I didn't want it to finish. So to me, that's high praise of a good book. Then I had to go back and finish it. So I'm very excited that you've done a second one. And I know already within the first few pages of the rough draft you sent me, you answered some of the questions and threads that one's left hanging with at the end.

Don't tell Nigel that you've got a rough draft.

I'll have a word with Nigel. Rohan, did you want to ask?

No, just, I didn't read Space Time, but I did read Expecting to Fly. As Brother Raghava mentioned, reading all of what you went through, you feel very fortunate. And you need to work hard on yourself. Like, this is nothing that we are worried about, like petty things. So that really motivated me, that we are actually really fortunate. It's a very important book for the next generations of Sahaja Yoga, really. The intensity of seeking, how do our generation understand that? It's through this book, honestly.

Actually, the whole thing's going full circle. The whole hallucinogenic drug thing is coming back into fashion. This time it's being led by scientists instead of just a handful of them, like last time. This time they're doing serious experimentation with it. I went to a lecture recently by someone who's researching it in Imperial College in London, just to see where they were at. And I thought they might be just ticking boxes, trying to find minor ways that they could adjust people's psyches. But no, this girl was on a mission. She wanted to convert the world. It was interesting; she really reminded me of how people were in the sixties. She couldn't say a lot, but she obviously believed in it a lot.

Because she'd had experiences similar to you, which have opened up this idea that there is more.

They know that there's some deeper self which you can experience, which can transform you, which doesn't really have any scientific basis at all, except subjective experience. But it is helping a lot of people in certain ways, but of course, there are lots of pitfalls that they're not aware of. But it's interesting that they're looking at it and it's becoming fashionable again.

Well, hopefully now there are more good signposts on the ground for those people who do start seeking, so they don't get lost.

There was one thing I wanted to touch on, which was the context. And I think that's something that Expecting to Fly especially really captures in terms of seeking of that time period. For people who have come later to Sahaja Yoga or who are practicing it now, that context is lost on many of us. I think a lot of us don't appreciate how fortunate we are. It's like we're on a flight altogether, and all of us who came later have hopped on mid-flight and it's nice and cozy in the cabin, but we weren't there on the tarmac when the wind was blowing and it was cold and we were trying to find the way into the airplane. I think that's something that is really important in terms of Sahaja culture, having that appreciation of what the world was like then and how little clarity maybe there was. And while hallucinogenics are becoming more fashionable again, I've also read how in the newest generation, the use of drugs and alcohol, at least in Canada, are on the decline because people are more aware of how harmful and dangerous it is. So in that sense, you can maybe see this collective evolutionary process going in a better direction where people are a bit more self-aware. And how important is your book for that? Because if there is a wave of it, of people being interested again, you've outlined so clearly the pitfalls.

Yeah, I guess so. Let's see. I hope so. God willing.

When you read that extract from Expecting to Fly, Pat, it was just a vibrational experience. Just boom. So really, thank you. Thank you for taking the time and the effort to share your knowledge and your experience in these books. And thank you, Gresna, for supporting your husband and helping him with all the proofreading and the editing and revising.

It's fascinating. The second one is very, very good. I just started it to inspire you, but it sounds like you're already inspired. Hopefully our attention on this will help you complete the second one.

Okay. Thank you.

You're welcome. Thanks for taking all the time to do all this work. All of you. People like me would never get around to it.

Well, you're busy writing. And we're here to support you. Every artist needs a publicity department.

Well, take care. Good luck and energy for finishing. Looking forward to it.

Thanks.
