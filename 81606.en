This is Berghaus. Sometimes we couldn't be at the Friends Meeting House, so Mother actually came here and gave a couple of programs. It's a beautiful house with a big grand piano; it was very elegant. I think Patricia used to play "Jerusalem." We always finished our meetings by singing "Jerusalem," which was great.

I drove around here with Mother once. I was pointing things out, saying, "Oh, I went swimming there. I went to school there." I thought, "Oh, poor Mother must be bored listening to all this." I showed her where I used to go swimming every day, and she said it wasn't good to go swimming every day. That was all she said.

So it's wonderful to be standing here because this is where the first regular Sahaja Yoga meeting in the West took place. Mother came here often. You'd get a message to say, "Oh, Mother's coming," so we'd ring around, and everybody came. So many people got their realization here.

We had two rules: one, we were going to speak to everyone and smile at them, and two, we were going to give them a cup of tea. And it worked. I think we had nine people at the first meeting, and in about three weeks, we had to have the big room because so many people came.

That's the best way to do the meeting, really. You've got to talk to people, welcome them, and show a bit of interest in them. Because when I first came, nobody ever spoke to you. Only Ritaâ€”do you remember Big Rita? She used to come and talk, but nobody else. They all used to look the other way.

This is Well Walk. When the plague was in London, the terrible plague, people came up here to live to get away from it. They drank the water up here and were okay. One lady died, and it turned out she'd been getting water from Soho because she liked that particular water. But other people came up here to escape the plague.

One thing Shri Mataji taught us, of course, which we never did in the West, was to look after ourselves. If you look in her box, she always has lots of creams for her face. She looks after her hands; she has cream for her hands. She sometimes used to go to bed with gloves on. So Mother looked after herself. It's not like people think, "Oh, it's not the done thing." But you should look after yourself. If you're a lady, especially, you should. Mother always looked lovely, her clothes were lovely. She told me off one day when I had an old necklace on. She was always giving us beautiful things so that we would look nice.

What are the sort of creams that she was using?

When I was traveling with her, she used to use a powder from Revlon, I think it was called Tempting Touch. I just remember Mother having it. She used it on her face.

And the hair oil, what sort of hair oil did she use?

I don't know what hair oil Mother used, but she used to recommend almond oil and coconut oil. I'd have to ask the nurses that. She said, "I look after myself. You should look after yourself. Look nice." Because people notice us. It's not so much that you go around talking, but people look at what you're doing, don't they? I know I learned when I first came by watching how certain people were with Mother, and then you copy that. It's the same with life as we are; people do notice.

She bought this cloak when we were in Bristol, I think. We were going to Bath, and she didn't have anything warm, and it did get cold. But when we arrived in Bath, which is a Roman city, she looked like a Roman lady. She got out of the car; she had a white sari with a red border, and she had this beautiful cloak. Unforgettable. Otherwise, she only bought things for other people. Endless shopping for others. She made a very good point. She said if you give something to somebody, then that person can't be cross with you. You look at something they've given you, and all the anger goes. It's beautiful. It's so true, isn't it? It's so simple. So she was always encouraging us to give things to others.

There was a puja in Exeter, and David drove Mother to Plymouth for a television interview he'd organized. Mother had a red sari on, and of course, I, with my television experience, said, "Well, I don't think red looks very good on camera." Anyway, when we got there, they were all waiting outside for Mother. The person doing the interview said, "Oh, Mother, you're here!" And she said, "Oh, I hope I'm all right in this red sari." "You look gorgeous, Mother! You look gorgeous!" he said. And she did look gorgeous.

When we got in the studio, she sat in, I think, a black chair with a white background, and the red looked wonderful. But I can hear him now saying, "Oh, you look gorgeous, Mother. You look gorgeous." She had told him what questions to ask, and they were quite tough questions. He was a very nice man.

That was about 1982, I think. David spent a year pestering them to put Mother on TB Southwest. He's a very obstinate man, the most obstinate person I've ever met. He just kept on and on and on.
