 (England)
It's our pleasure to greet you from a different part of England—this time from Cornwall, near Land's End, near Sennen—and to talk to you, Madhukar Aunty and Rajesh Kapoor Uncle, all the way in Delhi. Please share your journey with us. When was it that you got your realization and where were you? What were you doing? And I believe both of you got the realization at some point together, or was it one before the other?

Madhukar: This interview is so precious because I've seen some of your earlier episodes. Since you asked, I will now just give you a little brief, and then my husband will tell you more about it. We were in Lucknow—actually, we belong to Lucknow—but we were visiting Delhi. When the time came for our realization, I suppose that was the time. I was in Banaras, my husband was in Lucknow, and my childhood friend, Dr. Vinita Shankar, who is married to Dr. Rajiv Kumar, came to Lucknow. She came to meet my mother after a very long time and she talked about whatever she felt in summer. So, in 1991, I was teaching in Banaras at that time, so I was supposed to come two days later. My husband came and then he dropped her back.

When I came two days later to Lucknow, I met her again at his house, and then she mentioned something about yoga, of course. Then she said something about my husband's left heart giving a catch. I said, "What is all this?" Then she told me a little more about Sahaja Yoga, and I was intrigued. I had just done my M.Phil research from Calcutta University and I had come across the Gnostic Gospels, and those kinds of things leave a trail, so I was intrigued by all that. In literature, there's a lot of evidence about the left side, the right side, and the Greeks talk about it. So I said, "My God, she's my childhood friend, and she's talking about it."

Returning on the way back in the rickshaw, we were talking. And mind you, in the summer heat of Lucknow, we were talking.

Interviewer: If I may ask, where was this rickshaw in Lucknow? Lucknow is our connection; it's a dear place.

Madhukar: Yes, your parents are there, right? So you'll be able to place it when I say we were in the rickshaw from Nirala Nagar to Mahanagar, and going to Indranagar, because that's where we were living. On the way, she dropped down at Mahanagar where her parents were living, and I came home to Indranagar. It was decided between us that she will tell my husband about Sahaja Yoga. So, none of us had taken realization at that point; it was just getting to know about Sahaja Yoga for the first instance.

He came home from office, and the custom in our house was to prepare tea. While all this was going on, I said, "Guess who Nita was talking of?" So now I'll ask him to continue.

Rajesh: It was just like that. She was saying, "You guess who is her guru." I said I don't know anything about gurus. I never bothered about this gurudom and all. If I went somewhere, I went just to the temples. So then she said, "No, no, no, you just guess." It came out just from my mouth: Shri Mataji's personal name, Nirmala Srivastava.

Madhukar: And I jumped in! I said, "How come you took her name?"

Interviewer: My question too!

Madhukar: I was in the Krishnamurti campus, so I was a little aware of what all this was, so I sort of jumped in. It had never been discussed in our house before. No pamphlet, no reading, nothing.

Interviewer: Where did it come to your attention, if I may ask, Uncle?

Rajesh: I don't know. It came out just all of a sudden in my mind. It's the Devi speaking. At that time, I was not knowing Shri Mataji at all, but the name came. Then she said, "How do you know?" I said, "You are asking me? It came out like this."

Madhukar: I said, "This is so auspicious."

Rajesh: Yes, yes. And then the next day, Dr. Rajiv was coming to Lucknow. He took us to Mother's old house which she had got constructed. They called us, and we didn't feel much—at least I didn't feel much—but that's how it was a joint one. Together we got it, together we went there.

Interviewer: So in the summer of 1991, you got your realization in the house that Shri Mataji actually built, the house that she talks about in the puja. That's where you got your realization.

Rajesh: There were a few people, and it was the way things were: women worked on women, men worked on men.

Madhukar: Now, I went back to Banaras. I was working there, and that's when we were really on our own in Sahaja Yoga, getting little tidbits here, tidbits there, some tapes...

Interviewer: Did you feel anything when you got your realization in that summer of 1991? What was the experience like?

Rajesh: I did not feel anything, but from inside, something was inclining towards Shri Mataji. No doubts, nothing at all. I was not knowing much about these vibrations and all; I used to hear from other Sahaja Yogis. But it developed slowly. And how it developed... Madhu was in Varanasi, I was in Lucknow. Then I had a minor angina pain. I was alone with my children. It was the night. I just got up—I was not doing much meditation and all those things—but I just went to Shri Mataji's photograph on my altar. I lit the candle and sat down for some time. In the morning, I went to fetch milk, and then I came to know that something was blocking when I was walking. That was unstable angina, as it was diagnosed.

So then I called Madhu, I showed it to the doctor. The doctor said, "This is unstable angina. We have to watch for some time."

Madhukar: In the meantime, there was a call for the Ganpatipule seminar. That was the year that the Babri Masjid had also fallen, and because the colleges were closed, I could get a break. I came back to Lucknow and stayed with the family. Normally if you're working, you can't do that. And then it was announced that there is this big puja in Ganpatipule, so we should all go there. I told the leader over there, "My husband is not well." We were really, I would say, very young and innocent in Sahaja Yoga also. So he said, "Don't worry, leave everything to Shri Mataji." That's how we went.

Rajesh: I asked the doctor, and the doctor said, "If you are going with your family, then it's okay." But often, I used to feel pain in my heart. So he said that I should take a Sorbitrate whenever I feel pain. Whenever I used to walk or something and there was a pain, I used to take Sorbitrate. We went to Ganpatipule. Our pandal camp was on a hill's height, and the children were also with us. Our son was with me, so he said, "Papa, you don't worry. We are there. We will take the luggage and all."

So while going, I used to keep my tablet in my hand. If there was a pain, I would just put it in my mouth. That was the first day. I went to attend the seminar in the evening music program. It was a music program followed by the arrival of Shri Mataji. This was my first public viewing of Shri Mataji.

Interviewer: So that's the first time you actually saw Shri Mataji in person? Which year is this?

Rajesh: 1992. December '92. I went there, the program went on, and Shri Mataji came. When she went, I started going back to my camp, and I took the tablet in my hand because if it started paining, I would take it. But that was a day of surprising. I climbed and climbed, and there was no pain. I went into the camp, and I was so full of joy, tears were in my eyes. I said, "I don't... I didn't have pain." I threw that tablet. You will not believe, that whole of my stay in Ganpatipule, after that, I never took a tablet.

Interviewer: Wow.

Rajesh: And after that it continued. In Lucknow also, I never took any medicine. And you forgot to say that you prayed to Shri Mataji. The first day while climbing, I just prayed to Shri Mataji, "Shri Mataji, if this is my condition in this age, I don't want to be a burden on my family. So I will request you, either you take me from here, or cure me so that I can look after my family." After that, I never used any medicine.

Interviewer: This is very interesting, this miracle where you prayed to Shri Mataji, "Please cure it," because you were probably in your early 50s with a young family and you didn't want to be a burden. And you didn't have to take any of these prescribed medicines.

Rajesh: This is such a blessing of Shri Mataji. There was a seminar in Dehradun also. They said, "Mr. Kapoor, you tell your experience because today also you climbed, and your TMT is done."

Interviewer: TMT? Expand on that for the benefit of everyone watching, please.

Rajesh: This is a medical test which we do on the treadmill. It’s a stress test. If there's a stress, it will come out. He felt that there is no stress now. Though later on, it sort of ballooned into an episode, but that's much later in life.

Madhukar: Ganpatipule is in the Western Ghats and Dehradun is in the Himalayas, literally in Uttarakhand, the foothills of the Himalayas. So they used to select the sites which are a little more challenging. Though, in my opinion, he was being foolhardy, but then he rode it out. It's a leap of faith, isn't it?

Interviewer: How was it in Lucknow? Thanks for sharing that, that's an enormous miracle, basically, how Shri Mataji cured you. Tell us about your journey in Lucknow. What was the Sahaj scene in Lucknow in those days, in the early '90s?

Rajesh: I don't know, it was just... I never tried to do anything. I lately realized that Shri Mataji is using me as her instrument. She gave me the opportunities to go to different places in Lucknow and convey the message of this incarnation coming on earth, and the purpose of her incarnation. Public programs... that had become my inner calling. I used to love talking about Shri Mataji, talking about Sahaj Yoga, and giving realization. Fortunately, my leader was like that; he would always push me: "You go there, you tell." That development came, and I started telling in my office also. It happened that whosoever would come in my chamber, I would talk only about Sahaja Yoga.

Interviewer: Did you have Shri Mataji's photograph in your office?

Rajesh: Yes, I had. This is Indian Overseas Bank in the Hazratganj branch. You won't believe, my boss came. He told my HR people, "Why is this man sitting here, and for how long has he been here?" So he said, "For more than seven years." So he said, "Then transfer him from here." Then they said, "He's already under transfer." He said, "You relieve him from here." Then they talked to the place where I was posted, and they came to know that that office is closed in Delhi, so I was not relieved. The other person wrote to my head office about my transfer and was told, "The moment you get the permission, you relieve him." The next day, that person was transferred, and I was there.

Interviewer: Which year is this, Uncle? Give us some timeframe. This is such a miracle.

Rajesh: From '92, '93, '94, '95, '96, till '98, he was there. Then he was transferred to Ludhiana.

Madhukar: One of his bosses said, "Mr. Kapoor, when you come to my room, there is a total peace. What do you do?" I told him about the yoga, but his wife objected to bringing a photograph of a lady. So he said, "What should I do?" I said, "What I do is I keep a photograph in my room. You keep one in your room, and whenever you are free, you do meditation." He used to call me in his chamber, and he would sit down and say, "Please work on me."

Interviewer: Wow, this is in Lucknow, in the office.

Madhukar: And also in those days, the material wasn't much. So when you sit on a chair, you have access to office materials. So many things could be Xeroxed, many phone calls could be made. Yes. Now it's much more organized. Also, it was like, if you have the peace to discuss, you can do it. Otherwise, we weren't then having a formal center or anything like that. The tapes were far and few between. People were doing things through public programs. It is much later that tapes were easily accessible. So we would wait to go and get a tape or two or three or four, and then avariciously exchange it amongst each other. We were just so thirsty.

Rajesh: Shri Mataji was on all of us. She gave us the opportunity. There was a Muslim conference in Lucknow during this period, around '95. And Shri Mataji sent four or five people from all over the world. From the UK, a doctor came, and from France, he was Iranian but he lives in France, he came. They all stayed with us. What an opportunity she gave us to know more about Sahaja Yoga, to move with such good Sahaja Yogis. We were constantly being guided by Shri Mataji through these people, and we had a very good program in Lucknow also.

Interviewer: When did you then join up in Lucknow?

Madhukar: I was there in Banaras and had gotten my realization. I got two tapes from Dr. Rajiv. I used to phone them up, "Give me some." Somebody was coming to Banaras and they sent me two tapes. I diligently bought a cassette player, I put in the tape, I put the photo of Shri Mataji, lit a candle at night, and that was the first time I heard her voice. I remember that impact that her voice made in me. It went right through, deep into my heart, and I was totally enamored. I heard the whole talk completely at night. For me, that is such a powerful experience. Her message, hearing it from her... I do firmly believe that when we expose ourselves to her advice through her talks, they work on our chakras. Nobody else can lower our egos. Only she can, sometimes through laughter, sometimes through scolding us or whatever. That's my experience.

So I got them from the Bhogles of our center, if you remember. They lived very close to where our house is in Lucknow, in Indranagar. And Mummy actually went with Mrs. Bhogle once to Shri Mataji's Virat Puja. They both of them gave so much love to the collective. I always remember them with so much respect and love. They had a particular talk on the Lakshmi Tattva, the Nabhi Chakra, in Hindi. When I was there, I used to read all that and then pick up cues on the books that Mother recommended, whether it was the Gyaneshwari or the Amritanubhava or Saundarya Lahari. Access to all that is much easier in Banaras than anywhere else. It’s the hub.

So I was picking up all that also, along with my literature reading, and finding similarities. Then I said, "My God, what am I doing here? This way I'll never settle my Nabhi Tattva if I'm here and the children are there." So on the spur of the moment, I went to the management and said, "I want to resign." They were shocked. They said, "What's wrong? What have we done? You're doing well." I resigned, took a three-month notice period, completed the course, and came to Lucknow. Professionally speaking, that was a bit of a shock to everybody. Who else would be so foolhardy?

But then I came back. Those days, I did apply for places in Lucknow, etc., but didn't get it. Once I went to meet Sushmita; she had stayed with Shri Mataji in London. I just went there because I was confused about what to do. I'm still working, my children need me, and so on and so forth. I was sitting before her, and she was talking to somebody on the phone. She didn't know why I had come; I hadn't uttered my doubts or my queries to her. And whatever she was giving to that person in response to the questions on those landline phones, I was getting my answers, sitting at Mother's altar. When she finished, she said, "Yes Madhu, what can I do for you?" So I told her, "Sushmita Ji, I've got all the answers for which I had come. Thank you very much." I went back, resigned from that job once again, and then paid attention to my children.

Then later on, we were doing Sahaja Yoga work in Lucknow. He was doing it on his own, I was talking about it to the ladies. On a November 27th, I remember specifically, 1995, this letter came from UP Higher Education where they called me for an interview on the 1st or 4th of December. I said, "My God, I have put away my books, I've put away everything. I'm no longer connected with teaching, and here I have to appear before a board again." I went and got an encyclopedia, started reading up, and reached Allahabad for that interview.

When I reached there, before the board of seven—it's a big, prestigious body, and they're all experts—they turned to me and said, "Mrs. Kapoor, why are you here? You were selected the last time." So I said, "I'm here because the commission in its wisdom chose to send me to another city. I had to come to Lucknow because my family is here." They said, "You can't complain about the commission." I said, "Sir, I'm merely answering your question. If I had complained, it would be in writing before you." So they started treating me very nicely. The interview went off very well. On the way back, I met one of our Sahaja Yoginis in Allahabad. She said, "Oh, congratulations!" She said, "No, no, you've been selected in the Higher Education." I had got no letter. I pretended as though I knew everything. So she started telling me, "You are this, your number is there."

After a cup of tea and a nice talk, she went away. I said to Shushmita, "Look at the synchronicity." Mother's behind me. She left it for the Nabhi Chakra. She's orchestrating it all for you. A lot of people in Lucknow had got to know about Sahaja Yoga. A lot of senior IAS officers and their wives were doing Sahaja Yoga. One of them is a good friend of Mrs. Bharti Singh. Then I told her and her husband, so they rang up the people. They ensured that this time I get Lucknow. I was already there on the list. And when I got this college, I was so happy because once I joined, I came to know the college timing was from 7:30 to 11:30. So I have the whole day with my family.

Interviewer: Oh, it's a lovely college.

Madhukar: Lovely college. So we had the whole day to do our Sahaj activities. This was from '96 onwards. That's when the ladies were also in a kind of a separate but parallel group doing Sahaja Yoga. Because both of us were deeply involved, our home became quite the hub, I would say, in those days.

Then Shankarji was invited, you'll be so pleased to know. He came as a musician. He wasn't knowing much Sahaja Yoga.

Interviewer: When was it, Uncle, tell us?

Rajesh: '97.

Madhukar: He was a Sahaja Yogi, but knowing not much. But in Lucknow, giving programs of music, he developed Sahaja Yoga within himself. The work on ragas on chakras, he planned it all—the clearing with the different ragas. He planned it in Lucknow. He got that space to do it, and then he perfected it and went to Ganpatipule and gave a formal presentation also.

Interviewer: So he stayed with you for some time then?

Madhukar: Three months. Shri Mataji gave us a lot of opportunities. Imagine, listening to all the ragas and all the vibrations, and meditating. Live performance. That was very interesting because he was living with us just like a family member. Absolutely normal. And his wife, when she came to live with us, I can't tell you what a lovely person she was. She never made us feel that she is any different to us.

I was always fascinated by the Gruha Lakshmi Tattva, the Nabhi Chakra. The first time we met Shri Mataji was in Kalpana Ji's house. The day after the event, we went with flowers to meet Shri Mataji for the first time personally.

Rajesh: It was such a blessing. I came to meet her and bowed down. I said something in Marathi. We didn't understand. Shri Mataji said, "Just see how his Kundalini is playing before me." And she made us watch through his clothes in the month of November.

Madhukar: I remember her eyes, Sushmita. She kept looking with her eyes on his navel, focusing. And then she said this to us. We were completely nervous. "Look how the Kundalini is working." And you could see the pulsation on his navel. It's like a vein that is visible, but something is deeply pulsing.

Interviewer: Oh, you could see the movement on the sweater as it moved?

Madhukar: Like waves, but visible. She made it visible to us. Yes, of course. It's a miracle. Her love was so enveloping. We were strangers in her home, but her conversation was so enveloping.

Interviewer: This Prabhat Ji, the one you mentioned, Kalpana Ji's husband...

Madhukar: We grew up together. He and his brother and his parents, they were neighbors in Nishadganj. They were neighbors and they played together. He was the only child. Prabhat Bhai Sahib's mother was my mother-in-law's afternoon friend. Later on, I remember meeting her after my marriage also. That time, we didn't know anything about Sahaja Yoga till long, long after. In fact, in 1992 or '93, when Prabhat Bhai Sahib came to Lucknow, he came to our house in Indranagar. He saw Shri Mataji's photo, where she wears the white shawl, everybody's favorite photo. He saw the photo and then we started talking about Sahaja Yoga. Then he invited us to Bombay. That's how we went and had that little half an hour with the family and Shri Mataji.

Interviewer: What is this that Shri Mataji told you about so many things in such beautiful ways that only Shri Mataji does?

Madhukar: Yes, that's true. I feel that we were blessed, but not yet... I think we were too much of... not prepared to really take it in. In hindsight, we realized what we had got, but maybe we didn't suck in enough.

Rajesh: Around 1998, I was transferred to Ludhiana. My brother telephoned me. I told him that I have been transferred and Madhu and the children will remain in Lucknow because of their education. So he said, "Let me try through sources if you can be retained there." He spoke to somebody, but they said, "No, no. Whenever he's transferred, he uses political forces." While during all of my stay, I never used any political forces. Then he told me they are not ready. I said, "There will be something behind this transfer. So you don't worry now, let me go."

And that was the turning point for me in Sahaja Yoga. That I went there. I was alone there. So instead of selecting a separate apartment, I stayed in a men's hostel. It was just behind my office. I need not use any conveyance. I got a lot of opportunity because very few were doing Sahaja Yoga in Ludhiana at that time. There was a leader, Mr. Pathak, he was an advocate. Very few people there then. I used to go Saturday; there was always a collective meditation. But after that, the programs in Punjab started taking place. And nobody else would go there except me.

Madhukar: There was no person for Sahaja Yoga there. There were few people, and he got that chance, and he really loved it. See how it worked out.

Rajesh: And every step I used to feel, it is all Shri Mataji doing it. I went for a public program. Next day, I just got up from my seat, went for a follow-up program, again came back to my office, and did my work. It went on. And what affection and love I got from the collectivity there. In the UK, Navneet is there, she's a singer.

Interviewer: Yes, I know who you're talking about. Very nice.

Rajesh: Her mother first came to Sahaja Yoga. All the Sahaja Yogis used to come in my room. We were discussing about Sahaja Yoga and programs. So her mother used to take a walk. One day she came, she said, "There are a lot of people coming. You are talking very good things. Can I also join?" I said, "Of course." Then she started doing Sahaja Yoga, and Navneet used to go and drop her. One day Navneet came to me. "Uncle, what is there? My mother goes for some meditation. Something inside is attracting me, and I am pulled by some force to go inside." Then I told her about Sahaja Yoga.

Then she started doing shoe beating and all because they were having a case between their family. She used to tell me her experiences, like when she would do shoe beating, Ganesha would come and put a hand on her shoulders. She was teaching music, she wasn't a child, she was grown up. Her experience was so good. In music, one girl was not able to perform a Raga. She was trying and trying. So one day, all the students said, "Miss, why are you not going ahead? Why are you sticking on one?" Then she said, "Uncle, I prayed to Shri Mataji, that she is also your child, and these other students are your child." And that day, she performed that Raga beautifully well. Her experiences were superb.

Interviewer: One thing is, Lucknow is a very, well, not just Lucknow, but north of India, as Shri Mataji has also said, is a very male-dominated society. Still is. How did you, as a lady, as a yogini, as a woman, navigate that culture? Because, even if someone went there, the wife, or daughter, or any woman in the family, without the permission of the man, or the elder, they could not do anything. So, how did that work out?

Madhukar: Look, Sushmita, this is a tradition there in Lucknow. The second thing is that, after marriage, I realized, those days, I was regularly putting sindoor. That helps. And I found it was deeply respected in Bengal also. I got married very early, but in the streets of Lucknow, there was rampant eve-teasing. So, if I am a mother to a growing girl, I won't throw caution to the winds. So there is no harm in being aware and telling our children that this is the way it is. Later on, as Sahaja Yogis, you can differentiate between the bad Agnya and the bad Mooladhara. But that comes with Sahaj. And women have an instinct for this also.

Regarding our collective, our collective also showed that kind of male-dominance bias. But at home, I would have my little attempts at trying to wrest a little space for the women in our Sahaj collective. When Mother gave him the chance to take over the charge of the Lucknow Centre, when it was being constructed, and later on when he was in charge of the state also, I would insist that whenever you have a seminar, give us that half an hour, one hour, for the women's seminar, for a ladies' talk. Because it was important to tell the women. We were having very contradictory messages saying that if your wife doesn't do Sahaj Yoga, leave her. That was a wrong message going around. That was not the answer. You wouldn't say that to a woman, "If your husband is not doing Sahaj Yoga, you leave him." It's just not done in India.

So I was getting the feedback and realizing that's not the way to talk about it. You have to make yourself a part of the family and not be so disruptive. Otherwise, Sahaj will reflect badly on you, and it will cause a lot of reaction in the society that you are hoping to change through Sahaj Yoga. Even in a work environment, you can't enter my college and say, "I will teach only Sahaja Yogis." Sahaj becomes a deeply spiritual and a very personal practice. You have to learn to wade through the muddy waters of whatever your society around you is doing. I have my failings. I didn't carry the magic wand of Sahaj Yoga everywhere, and everybody didn't change immediately. No. But I could hold my own. For me, that was important.

Also, I realized that we cannot be so disruptive. That was through a painful experience of many Sahaj Yogi women who tried to sort of throw it in their faces. You cannot throw Sahaj Yoga in somebody's face. They have to desire it. And also, the Sahaj treatments can be too much for people to stomach initially. For example, if you go to somebody's house and you're a new bride and you insist on putting a matka for the house, you take your time to do it. But in the collective, things are changing. People are telling each other in a more acceptable way how to remould yourself.

Interviewer: This is so interesting. Let me share with you two things that happened to us as a family when we took to Sahaja Yoga.

Madhukar: Vinita came that same year in September and she gave realization to my children. My son was going through a period where his tonsils were always aggravating him, and the coming months would have taken him for a tonsillectomy. But she said very casually, she said, "Oh, Shri Mataji ne kaha hai, ki ghee kapoor laga do, theek ho jayega." So, we started applying ghee and camphor every night. And slowly, slowly... ajwain dhuni he didn't take to because it was very strong, but we applied the ghee and camphor at night. And what happened, Sushmita? His tonsils became okay. And he never needed the operation. And slowly, he took to Sahaj music in a big way. His appreciation of classical music unfolded through Sahaj music. So he's deep into classical music understanding, much more than all of us. And my daughter also took to Sahaj Yoga, as children. Such a blessing. So we all came in it together, and we are just hoping that it will carry forward in the third generation also.

Interviewer: You must hear about how the message of handling the Lucknow Centre came to Rajesh. Please share with us.

Rajesh: Actually, in 2001, I took voluntary retirement. I was in Ludhiana. I was telling them, "Please put me either to Lucknow," because they were all alone and there was a massive theft in our house. They said no. So there was a scheme; I took the retirement and came to Lucknow. I was on my way to Lucknow, so I stopped in Delhi and I was with my brother. That time, the country leader was Mr. Nalgirkar. He telephoned me. "Mr. Kapoor, you go to Lucknow and take over charge from the present coordinator." That was Rajiv Joshi. I said, "Mr. Nalgirkar, I'm just coming in from Ludhiana. I don't know anything about UP and Lucknow." So he said, "I'm not saying this. These are Shri Mataji's orders." Then I had nothing to say.

I came to Lucknow, and at that time, our center was in Chowk, in Nehru Park. We had bought land in Gomti Nagar, so the construction had already started. At that time, when I took over, everybody was shocked because there was a full team working. The ego clash comes. For me, it was Shri Mataji's orders and I followed that. When I saw the accounts, there was only a balance of 4,000 rupees. And there were loans of more than 40 to 50 lakhs from Sahaja Yogis. The leader at that time had said, "You people, please give us the loan. As soon as the money comes, we will give you back." And the construction was going on. For me, the biggest problem was how to work with 4,000 rupees, how to pay the loans.

That was the time when Shri Mataji called me in Pune. I went there and was asked to wait outside. Shri Mataji was talking to somebody. Then I was called. Two people were sitting there. Shri Mataji told those two people, "Please go out." I was all alone. There was, literally, fear inside. Alone with Shri Mataji. I can't tell you, she asked me, "What is happening in Lucknow? What about the loan? What about all things progressing?" Everything she was asking. Then she was talking about what is happening in the country, and in that, she was telling how money is swindled in Sahaja Yoga. I just thought, "Shri Mataji, why is she telling me? Is there any fault in me? She wants to teach me." Then she said, "You don't know. I have given a second life to these people, and they have taken all my money." Then she told me, "Look what is happening in the South," talking about Amma. "All her disciples are working day and night. And here, my disciples, all to whom I have given life, they are doing things against me."

I just sat down. She talked about many people. I was shocked. After that, I did pranam to Shri Mataji and got up. Then she said, "While you are going, meet Mr. Srivastava." I came outside. The dining table was there, all people were sitting there. Sir CP was also sitting there. He asked me, "Have you spoken to Shri Mataji?" I said, "Yes, Papa. I have spoken to her." "What did she say?" I said, "She said, 'I will keep meeting you.'" He said, "Okay." Then he gave me a check of 12 lakhs. "This is for your center, to make a bathroom." And you won't believe, I tell you, I put those 12 lakhs in the center's account. After putting that, that 12 lakhs never went down. Money started pouring in. The center was constructed. All helped me, all whom I never knew. They came out. Still, they are there. That time, I definitely felt, "You are doing nothing. Everything was done by the supreme power."

Interviewer: When was this meeting with Shri Mataji?

Rajesh: 2001. After the birthday puja. And somebody told me Shri Mataji was asking about you in the USA. I just overheard it. So she was knowing everything. And she knows today also, everything about everybody. Then she asked me, "What are you doing?" I said, "Shri Mataji, I was in a bank. I took VRS." In my thoughts, it came, "Shri Mataji knows everything, why is she asking me?" Then she said, "Mr. Kapoor, you must have suffered a loss." So I said, "Shri Mataji, I did calculations. With my pension and my interest on my deposits, it will be equivalent to my salary." She said, "No, you must have suffered a loss." And you won't believe, all of a sudden, the interest on all the deposits fell down. It was 12%, it came to 8% that time. And that was my loss. She told you before you knew. Amazing. That was really putting inside me that you are nothing, but just go on doing Sahaja Yoga work. And today, if I see the records of the center, I don't know who did that work. She's the doer.

I think I went to 45 districts in UP. The best programs were there in Meerut, Jhansi, and Gorakhpur. And for morning meditation, I stayed for five, six days in Vindhyachal. It was a beautiful atmosphere at that time. You have not to think. Only you have to, by heart, go on doing it, and it will work. That is the beauty.

Madhukar: On our 25th wedding anniversary, we got a chance to sit at Shri Mataji's feet. Shri Mataji was very gracious to allow us to visit her. We had sweets. After that, she asked, "Where, what are you doing?" My son was there, my daughter was there. So she said, "Okay, so one in Ludhiana, one in Lucknow, one in Loni." My son was studying in Loni, and my daughter was in LSR. And she laughed. She really laughed. I mean, she always was so human about it also. She enveloped you with her human love. It made you feel that in her presence, you could still feel very nice, but not overwhelmed so that you were totally stunned or rigid. I'm grateful for that.

And a little story about Shri Mataji's house. When that house was sold, it's possible Prabhat Bhai Sahib said to him, "Please open my account," or whatever it is. He's a little shy in telling this, but I like to talk about it.

Rajesh: I got a letter with my name, Rajesh Kapoor, on my desk. And in that, there was a letter for the closure of Shri Mataji's account. And below, whose signature is it? Shri Mataji's signature. I was not attending that department, but it came on my desk. I was very surprised. I said, "This is also a coincidence." It should have gone to the branch where Shri Mataji's account is. Why is it coming to the administrative office? Then it came to me.

Madhukar: And also that here, your heart is all full. "My God, what a signature!" That's a very mundane thing to say, but yet it is.

Interviewer: It's not. It's so special. Shri Mataji's signature. Wow.

Rajesh: At that time, I totally forgot where I am. You do your meditation, take your level to that level, and if your guru is competent, the guru will give you that state. And she has said this thing: you have to reach to that level; your guru will provide you that. That day, it was a lesson. You go on doing your meditation, have those qualities what she is telling you a Sahaja Yogi should have, and then she is there. I mean, you can imagine what Shri Mataji is. It is very difficult to create that sort of thing within your heart.

Interviewer: Absolutely, Uncle. You really summed it up so nicely and beautifully because she is in each particle of earth, air, ether, all the elements. And she is looking after us all the time.

Rajesh: It should come within our heart. Because when we do our Ganesha Atharvashirsha, we say, "Everything is yours." This is it. And it is the reality with us. Everywhere, Shri Mataji is there.

Interviewer: That is beautiful. It is so nice that you took this time out. It's very late where you are in Delhi. This is such a pleasure for us.

Madhukar: Don't, don't. I have great memories of both your father, interacting with him when I reached his home, and your mother for other reasons. Great affection for them.

Interviewer: We realize that things change, but what matters is the heart. The connection is there, and that's where Shri Mataji resides. And that's all that matters, isn't it?

Madhukar: But still we are so close, thanks to Shri Mataji. Say hello to Shankarji also, and tell him that we look forward to going to Banaras with Bholenath.

Interviewer: Thank you so much. Thank you, Shri Mataji, again and again.
