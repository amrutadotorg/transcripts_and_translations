I forgot to mention one cute little moment with Shri Mataji that took place in New York during the 1981 tour. It was after the public program—I'm not sure if it was the first or the second—and we went to dinner at a diner. There were eight of us, including Shri Mataji, at two tables separated by an aisle, with two yogis on each side of each table. I was on one table on the inside, and Shri Mataji was at the other table just to my right, on the outside.

I had been a very staunch vegetarian. When I talked about being so badly damaged, I was damaged in countless ways, and I was fasting a lot. It was like self-deprivation. So the yogis back then in London had been really trying to get me to eat anything, including meat. I was staunch about it, and it became a real ego trip, which I didn't realize at the time. I felt, "Okay, we don't have to kill animals, and I'm a better person for that. I'm better than other people who eat meat." It had become an arrogance, and the yogis had been working so tirelessly to try to get me to just eat meat.

We went to this diner, and I'm looking at the menu. All of a sudden, I had this incredible desire to eat chicken. I hadn't eaten it in at least eight or nine years. There was a battle going on as I'm looking at this menu, trying to find anything vegetarian. There was very little. I'm staring at this menu, and this desire is not going away. I have this battle going on inside, and all of a sudden I look up and look over at Shri Mataji. She gave me this massive smile as if to say, "I'm doing that." I understood. I surrendered and ordered the chicken sandwich.

The next day—so it must have been the night of the first public program—she was speaking about Navi Chakra, Swadhisthana and Navi. I think she might have done both in one day. And she said in the talk, "If you want to please Sri Lakshmi, she's very fond of chicken." And she looked right at me.

I feel every day is a gift. I was on that first tour. I heard Abdul's story about how one day Mother had him put his hand on her liver and he got so sick. Well, I was like that the whole first week of the tour. I was really sick, and I probably spent a good 20 years working on that left Nabhi. Slowly, slowly, slowly, it didn't go away overnight. But there have been incredible miracles that happened... Actually, there was one with Mother, but it didn't involve communicating with her. It was during a puja in Los Angeles in 1983... I think I have to go. I'm not going to tell it.

No worries. But please, please just make a little note of these things as they occur to you, and please do come back again, because it's been an absolutely wonderful evening. Thank you.

Thank you, Caroline. Thank you for your patience.
