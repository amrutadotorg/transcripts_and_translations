 (England)
Well, I got my Realisation in July 1982, but before that time, I'd worked for many years as a journalist on evening and weekly newspapers. I was very professional and dedicated and all of that, and it was all-consuming, reallyâ€”a very heady job, very right-sided. But I was a journalist, and I didn't know who I was. I didn't know myself. So I was seeking, but not really aware I was seeking, I suppose, at the time.

As part of all that, in 1981, I decided to step back from it all, and I went off to Bristol, actually, to do a degree in humanities. At the end of the first year, I went back to Derby to work on my old newspaper, the Derby Evening Telegraph, for the summer. At that point, Shri Mataji was touring part of England, I think, and I was in the newspaper office in July 1982 when two Sahaja Yogis came in. It was actually Hester and David Spiro. I was sent out to the front of the office to meet them because I'd been doing Hatha yoga, and the news editor said, "Oh, yes, she knows about yoga, she can go out to the front."

So they sent me off to meet them, and I couldn't understand a word they were saying. I couldn't understand what they were talking about at all. But I thought, well, they must be okay, because she's a lawyer and he's a doctor, so they can't be mad. So, if I was going to write an article about this Sahaja Yoga and about Shri Mataji coming to Derby, then I was going to have to go to this meeting where Shri Mataji was coming. It was on a Saturday evening, so, very dedicated, I went along with my notebook and my pen.

It was in the Guildhall in Derby, and it was absolutely packed. I was sort of halfway down a row of seats, squashed in the middle. I remember Shri Mataji came on the stage, and at that point, I was aware of a flame rising up in me. Just in my awareness, I was thinking, "This is rather odd," sort of like a warm flame. Shri Mataji gave her talk, and I don't remember much about it other than she said England was the heart of the universe. I thought, "Wow, that sounds really interesting." I had my hand up to ask a question, but she didn't pick me.

Then she said, "And now we'll have the experience of Realisation." I thought, I've come here to report on this sort of thing! I looked to see if I could get out of the room, actually, because I'd never done anything like that before. I wasn't really interested in meditation; I was interested in politics and all that kind of thing. But I couldn't get out. It was so packed, and I was in the middle of this row. I remember thinking to myself, "Well, I've never done anything like this before, but okay, I'll just do it this once." So I put my hands out. I wasn't feeling very much in my hands.

But one of the Sahaja Yogis came behind me, obviously noticed I had a notebook and a pen, realized I was a local reporter, and took me up on the stage to meet Mother. I was kneeling before her.

So you were kneeling before her as a reporter?

Yeah. And she took my right hand, and she was doing the sign of the cross... My right hand... It's very emotional, this part. I didn't think it would be, but it is. Yes, she was doing the sign of the cross on my right hand, and she was saying, "She works so hard, she works so hard." There were these Sahaja Yogis at the back of me, raising my left side like this. I was just completely puzzled. I must have been looking at Mother, but I was just completely confounded by what was going on. I was just thinking, "Well, who is she? Who is she? Who is she?"

Anyway, I then left the building. I remember David Spiro was there, and he said, "So what did you think?" And I just sort of went like this and got in my car and drove off. Everything was very clear; it was like a cinemascope or something. A really wide vision. Everything was just really clear. I drove home, parked the car, pulled the handbrake on, looked around, and I thought, "I don't live in this house anymore." I'd been completely thoughtless, and I'd actually driven to the house where I used to live, just out of habit. I'd actually been staying in a different place with a friend. So I looked around and thought, "No, I don't live here anymore." It was at that point I realised that something had happened. I'd been completely thoughtless.

Then I drove to where I was staying. It was actually Pat Layden's house, and there was a party going on. I remember walking into this party and telling everyone about the evening I'd had. And Pat said, "Oh, I'll do that." She went along to the meeting the next night, actually. And she's a Sahaja Yogi now. So we came together, actually. And then I did write an article for the Derby Evening News about Mother. They published a big picture of Mother in the paper.

Do you have a copy of it?

I probably have, actually. Yes. And just at that point, I had arranged to go abroad. I went and travelled around Europe for a month. I didn't take Mother's photograph, but I thought about it a lot while I was away. Then I came back to England. I got the train to come back to Derby; I had my rucksack on and everything. The train pulled into the station at Derby, and I opened the door. Framed in the doorway was a Sahaja Yogi on the platform. It was Bala Kanesan. He had a beaming white smile and he said, "Oh, fantastic! We had 40 people come to the meeting!"

But it was just amazing because the first person I met when I came back to England was a Sahaja Yogi. I thought, "Well, there's something in this," that I'd met this person straight away. And then I just sort of carried on with it after that. I went back to Bristol and met the Sahaja Yogis there and went on from there.

You met me first, I have to say.

Oh, yeah! He was the first Sahaja Yogi I met in Bristol. Isn't it funny? And we got married. Yeah, it was really funny. I'd been given the address of the Sahaja Yogis in Bristol, and you'd just moved there, hadn't you?

Yeah, we moved from London.

You and Bernard had moved to this little flat. And I turned up there at the flat one Sunday, and he was outside wrestling with the TV aerial in the alleyway, weren't you? Yeah. He was the first Sahaja Yogi I met in Bristol.
