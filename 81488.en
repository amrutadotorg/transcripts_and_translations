You were talking about drugs and things. Do you remember that fellow who came to Shri Mataji—the one who was injecting? I can't remember his name. The one who threw the brick through the window. That's the one.

Yes, what happened was Mother worked on him and cleared him out. He thought, well, he'd just have another, because he'd been injecting for goodness knows how long. But Mother cleared him out, and he was all right. Then he went and had another fix, just to see if he could resist it.

Anyway, he got so angry that he came to where we were having a meeting. We were on the third floor. He threw a stone through the window—not a brick, a rock about that size. We saw it come through the window, and it went towards Mother and then off at an angle. She pointed it out. She said, "Did you see the way that brick went?"

Then I jumped to my feet and went roaring downstairs to beat the hell out of this guy. I was so angry. They told me afterwards that Shri Mataji was putting bandhans on me so that I wouldn't find him.
