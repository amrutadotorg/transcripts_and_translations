Let us start from a long time back, from when I was 16. It was a time when Shri Mataji came to the Rome ashram, so we were hosting her. She was staying in the old Nirmal House in Rome, in a special side of the ashram. She had a beautiful room with windows that opened to the garden, and I had the immense blessing to look after her. I was one of the many that were looking after her, but being a little yuva, I had this great blessing to make sure that Shri Mataji had her breakfast and tea and everything.

Being there these days, I decided, "This is my moment." I was going to be alone with Shri Mataji, and then I could ask her what was in my heart, my greatest desire, which was to be a brahmacharini in my life. Just to be at the service of the collective and never get married, never have a family, because the Sahaja Yogis are my family. After all, I came to Sahaja Yoga when I was 12 and I always lived collectively, so for me, it was clear. This was my mission. I said, "This is a perfect time to ask this to Mother."

So I arrived. I really prepared my sentence to ask her. I thought, "This is the right moment, I'm serving the tea." I looked at Shri Mataji and I just said, "Ma." Not even "Mother," but just "Ma."

Shri Mataji stopped me immediately. Immediately. And she told me, "I have to find a nice boy for you."

And immediately, in two seconds, there was lots of movement around the room and lots of energy going around. Shri Mataji called Uncle Guido immediately into the room, and I don't know what happened. Suddenly, my life changed in one second. I didn't know what was happening. I felt very confused, and Shri Mataji was already talking to Uncle Guido about finding a nice boy for me.

I said, "Now this is all wrong. This is all wrong. This is not what I meant, Mother, not at all." I remember going down the staircase from her room, and already all the ashram was down the stairs. Everybody was sort of cheering, and I was thinking, "What's happening exactly? I don't understand. Things didn't go exactly the way I meant."

Then one day, while I was having my foot soak on the roof of the ashram, Shri Mataji called. My parents were eating in the dining room all together, and there was this phone call that said that Shri Mataji had found someone for me to marry. I just remember getting a very big bump on my head because I stood up from my foot soak very fast and the roof was very low. So this was the first shock. And the second was just to see my parents not getting any food from their plates because they were missing all the pieces of food. They were totally in some sort of strange cloud.

Then came the moment at Guru Puja in Gmundan where I met Victor for the first time, where Shri Mataji announced the engagement. I remember when she announced the engagement, everybody started cheering and going "Ah!" and all that. I became like a red pepper in my face. I was so shy, I couldn't actually reach the place to go near Shri Mataji's feet. She told them off a little bit and said, "You shouldn't do like this because they're very young and they're very shy." She sort of quietened the atmosphere a little bit until I reached Shri Mataji's feet and Victor did. I didn't even look at him. And Shri Mataji asked me if I was happy. "Yes, of course, I don't know, I don't see him, I don't know. Yes, fine, it's good."

This was the first meeting. So at this point, I leave you for the other part.

Victor: Isn't there a little bit of a pre... I mean, just before then, which is the performance?

Purna: Yeah, but this is your part, not mine.

Victor: Your reaction though... her reaction was shock, I think.

Purna: Ah, when I saw you the first time with your leopard leotard...

Victor: I was wearing a leotard, hand-painted, and I just performed some Blake songs for Shri Mataji dressed in this kind of costume. I don't know what she thought.

Purna: I didn't look at you. I just went down. Anyway...

Victor: I've got to sort of rewind a little bit because I think my side happened a little bit earlier. I was in the third year of my university degree in Drama and American Studies. And to be honest, I had been in Sahaja Yoga for about three years. I'd lived a sort of almost monk's life at university, and I was getting a bit lonely. There was the strain of being probably the only student there who didn't have some sort of romantic attachment. It was my final couple of months before the finals, and I had to study. It was all getting too much; I was on my own and it was intense.

One morning, I was sitting in front of the photograph. I had a huge photograph. So many students passed through my room, and I asked them to feel the vibrations. They mostly felt cool. I hardly ever felt cool, I don't know why that was, unfortunately. But there I was that morning, a supplicant for Mother's love and vibrations. I just opened up my heart to the photograph and spoke out loud. I asked Mother, "Please, please can I have a partner in my life? Can I have a wife? Can you please find me someone?" Because the alternative was to find someone who you liked but who wasn't necessarily spiritually dedicated, or somebody who would recognize Mother or want to do Sahaja Yoga. And that would have been a complicated scenario that I wasn't prepared to contemplate.

So there I was, and I prayed to Mother, "Mother, please find me a fiancée or a wife," because that was the alternative in those days. That was it, you know, sister or wife and nothing in between. So I asked her for that, and then I continued studying.

Actually, I got fed up with studying. Sahasrara Puja was coming up, and my finals were on the Monday after the puja. And the puja wasn't in England; it was in Switzerland. So I decided to go to the puja and get back in time for Monday morning to sit my finals. Everybody thought I'd done a runner. They didn't see me for the weekend.

I went to the puja. It was in Italy, but it was kind of in the Alps. And as everybody who went to that puja remembers, it was quite difficult to get up there. It was kind of misty, and there was this golden madonna at the top. I remember that occasionally if the clouds parted, you saw it, and it was very auspicious. And that happened, actually, when Mother was there.

What happened was, basically, that on the Saturday night there was an evening program. There were some attempts at songs; in those days, we were still learning. I think we knew a few bhajans like Hari Bol and other things like that. Then, I remember there was a sudden announcement: "And now, a dance."

The music began—it was Federico Marincola, he was playing keyboards, and Antonio Saracino as well. The music was quite ethereal. And then this apparition comes to the stage. Although the music had begun, she didn't begin dancing. Before she started, she actually went to Shri Mataji's feet and she bowed down. That was the most important thing she was doing there. It wasn't the dance; you felt she was bowing to Mother's feet. And in that moment, I just felt the devotion of an artist's soul dedicating herself to Shri Mataji. I kind of felt, "Oh my gosh, oh my goodness, she's an artist, she's a dancer. Oh, I wish in my life if I could marry someone like that." I felt part of that namaskar. I felt the movement inside myself, the wish to do that.

So she started dancing. It was totally amazing. I was way at the back somewhere, and there was just movement, I remember. My Kundalini just came up very, very strongly, and it was like a very powerful spiritual experience. It was really special.

What happened at the end was nothing. I didn't even go up and congratulate her. I was too shy. I didn't go anywhere near her. But this feeling persisted, that if I should marry someone, it would be someone who had that depth inside and that devotion and dedication that she had manifested in her dance. I remember I met her mother, a very nice lady. I remember her adjusting the sari on the throne with such love and attention. I thought, "Oh my God, this is devotion. This is bhakti." I remember I met her father as well, though I hadn't realized that until a long time later.

Anyway, to cut a long story short, after the puja, Mother called all the children to her feet for names. And amongst the very, very short girls and boys that went to Shri Mataji, there was a much taller one.

Purna: They pushed me. I didn't want to go, they just pushed me there.

Victor: It was Purna. And by the time she got to her, Mother asked her how old she was...

Purna: I don't remember.

Victor: I think she did. And then Purna swears Mother never said this, but I heard she said...

Purna: "Nice boy." No, it's not true! You just had that... there is even the video, you just... alright.

Victor: Maybe it was inside, whatever. That's exactly what I remember. And I felt in that moment, "Oh, I hope it's me." And that thought flashed across my mind. I immediately pulled my ears. "What are you...?" I just couldn't help it. I put a bandhan on it. Look, I mean, is that how it works? Being honest, this is it. This is how it was.

And that's it. I never saw her, never talked to her, and completely forgot. I went back to university, did my finals, thought I'd failed miserably. Then I went to wait for the results in the King's Cross ashram. I don't know if anybody ever went there, but it was dignified by the vibrations that were always there. We could call it an ashram, but otherwise, you would call it a squat. But it was the ashram because there was the altar there, we meditated together, we ate together. I don't know what, I think there was a gas burner.

But what happened next was amazing. I was there, everybody had gone to work. I was a student, I had an excuse; I was waiting for my finals results. The phone rang, and somebody said, "Victor, Shri Mataji is leaving at Gatwick airport, and we should go and see her off." I felt, "Oh gosh, I'm in no condition." I felt completely run down. I felt like an un-ironed shirt, you know? That's how I felt. So I immediately thought I must find an excuse not to go. I had no excuse. And then I suddenly felt, "But she's my Mother. I can't let my Mother leave on her own. I have to go and see her off." In that frame of mind, I was able to gather myself and go and see her off at Gatwick airport.

Looking around, you could always find where Shri Mataji was because there was a huge crowd of yogis, all trying discreetly to be unseen, pretending not to be there. Trying to give Mother her space, but we were there. Mother got up. Time to go. The crowd, everybody stood up. I was at the back somewhere, in a corner where I actually wanted to be. And then suddenly the crowd sort of moved. It's like a hive, you know, with the queen. And then suddenly Mother was in front of me with her back turned. I was in a corner, I had nowhere to go. I pulled my ears because of the sense of unworthiness that I felt at the time.

And then suddenly, Mother turns towards me, beams at me, and says, "Victor, how are you?"

"Very well, thank you."

"Do you want to get married?"

And I said the only thing that I could say, which was, "Yes, of course, please!"

She said, "I found a lovely girl for you. She's very beautiful, she's a dancer, she lives in the Rome ashram, and her name is Purna."

I was just overwhelmed, in a sort of stupor, almost. And then Mother... she decided where she was going. She didn't say, "Where is the terminal?" Incidentally, I'd been asked to go off earlier to find the gate, but something had pulled me and told me, "Don't go, I had to stay there." Anyway, she takes me by the arm like this, and I accompany Shri Mataji to the gate, and everybody else coming around. We were just like a huge family seeing Mother off. She went through the gate, and she turned around and she waved at all of us. And that was it. It was a fairy tale. It was completely a fairy tale.

I promise, when Mother said it to me, I couldn't picture her because I hadn't gone anywhere near her. I was too shy. And it was really a surprise when we actually first met in Gmundan. It really was the first meeting. She'd sent me a present, I think, before. A package full of sweeties and a little mouse with a tail and a heart sewed on the tail.

Purna: Really, really sweet. You don't have to tell these...

Victor: Anyway, we met in Gmundan, and I remember distinctly we were at Mother's feet, where Purna left off. And Mother said to me, "Do you like her?" And like 800 or a thousand people... suddenly, you could hear a pin drop, waiting for the answer. We'd barely seen each other. "Yes, Mother, thank you so much." It was funny. That was the situation.

Purna: Later on, we had to have a meeting to get to know each other. So I was supposed to go and see Victor in England, in London. But Shri Mataji had this amazing program with Romano Battaglia. It was a very special period, and all the yogis from Rome were following Mother. We were with her, and I was supposed to catch this plane from Pisa. Everybody was there and they said to my mom, "Okay, just leave your daughter here and come with us to Volterra, because that's where we're going to meet Shri Mataji."

And my mother said, "You are all completely mad. I'm not going to leave my 16-year-old daughter the first time she takes a plane by herself in the airport. I will wait with her." And everybody, of course, at the time was like, "Oh, you're so attached," blah, blah. Anyway, she stayed there with me. We had to wait quite a long time, so we decided to go to Pisa for a walk. There is a main square which is called Miracle Square in Pisa, where there is the tower. We were reaching the arch to the square when suddenly I see Uncle Guido. As usual, I was like, "Oh, Uncle!" and I was running, and he tells me, "Shri Mataji is here."

So Shri Mataji comes out of the car and she looks at us and she wants to know why I'm there, what's happening. And Uncle Guido tells her that I was supposed to catch a plane to go and see Victor. So she looks at me, she looks at my mom, and she says, "Victor is in my home now. And she can't travel by herself."

Suddenly, another miracle in the middle of Miracle Square. She changed the ticket of the person that was supposed to travel with her to me. And so my mother suddenly started crying, of course, because that's what we do in Italy. It was just all too much. A 16-year-old daughter was going to see her fiancé, and the fiancé was at Mother's house. And I was not traveling anymore by myself, but I was actually traveling with Shri Mataji. So everything was just all too much, and crying, crying, and crying.

So I went back to the collective, and the day after I traveled with Mother. And it was just everything was a dream, basically. I mean, it was a dream not because I was going to see Victor, but because I was traveling with Shri Mataji. So I was there with my little luggage and my little hat, all ready to meet him. I remember Uncle Guido said, "Okay, now you have to remember to do this and to take this document and to take this back..." I was so confused. And then Shri Mataji told him, "Don't worry, I'm going to look after her. It's not the first time I travel."

At that moment, I had Shri Mataji's beauty case in my hands. I was supposed to... I took my hat and gave it to my mommy, and Shri Mataji took my hat and she held it. She wanted me to bring it with me. All these delicate details, you know, it was just unbelievable. And there is this beautiful photo of us walking from the stairs down to the plane, of Shri Mataji holding my hat and me near her holding her beauty case, saying goodbye to all the yogis. It was just incredible.

Then when we got on the plane, Shri Mataji kept talking to me about Victor and what a beautiful person he was, and how precious, and what a very happy life together we would have. And that we had to be friends with Robert and Natalie because Robert was his best friend, so we had to be friends. She was building up a beautiful life that we were going to have together, advertising Victor all the time to me.

And then we arrived in England. Of course, I was behind her, and I didn't know where to go because I knew that Victor was at her house, but me... no. So when we arrived, the car was there. She was behind, and then she called me inside the car. I just went trotting inside, and we arrived in front of Shri Mataji's house in Dulwich.

Shri Mataji went out of the car, and Victor was there ready with a tray to do arti. She looked at Victor and she said, "I have a nice surprise for you." I got out of the car and Victor dropped the whole plate with the arti. And Shri Mataji just started laughing, laughing, laughing. "Look at this man!" And Victor didn't know what to do with himself. He tried... it was a mess. So Shri Mataji told him to give himself a good bandhan and start all over again because it was just not possible otherwise.

And then we went inside the house. And then there were two or three days that were like a fairy tale. It was a fairy tale. Mother actually had to push us to communicate and have any sort of contact because we were really very shy. I remember one of the first things was, she said, "Go and watch television together." And we went into the TV room, and there was a big television and a huge sofa. I'd never seen such a long sofa in my life. And we were at either end, looking at the TV. We really didn't know what to say.

Oh, there were some magical moments, like waking up in the morning and bringing Mother her tea in her room and being able to sit before her and even sing her a song. There were some amazing things. And one day, she actually said to us in the afternoon, "Why don't you go out into the garden? There's a swing." And we went to this swing and it was kind of rusty, you know? But Shri Mataji was looking from the window. She was looking, we realized. And she looked at us like, "So, what are you going to do?" It's like...

Victor: She sat on the swing and I pushed her. It was quaint and almost sort of Victorian and sweet and lovely. I remember then Mother another day said, "I'm going shopping, and you can go out for a walk in the park. And you can hold hands." But also, she wanted to know if my parents were happy. She would make sure that my parents were happy about it, that they would know that I was okay.

Purna: And then the ring, at a certain point...

Victor: Then we moved to Antonio and Caterina's house. And then Shri Mataji said, "Have you bought a ring?" I said, "Well, actually, I've got a ring for her." "No, I haven't, Shri Mataji." And she said, "Well, you must get her a ring."

Purna: So you got me a beautiful ring that she wanted to see on the day of the Raksha Bandhan. Remember? She wanted to make sure that I would show the ring. And there is a beautiful photo where she actually sees the ring. It was a ring with four rubies in the form of petals, so it was like the Mooladhara chakra. And in the middle, there was a little diamante, like a diamond. She was saying that it was the color of the heart but the four petals of the Mooladhara. So she really liked it.

Victor: It was really quite magical because, for me, I had been disowned by my family, by my own mom. And Shri Mataji was saying, "Well, maybe you can take her to meet you... home with you." And I kind of... I didn't want to open that subject with Shri Mataji. I didn't want to... but she immediately knew everything. So she immediately said that Purna could stay with the Shallows because she thought maybe she could have been a guest at my place, but that would have been complicated. So, there was all that. Most of everything is just this constant care for the details and for the human side of things, that was always so full of love, so full of attention for everything.

Purna: And also the care for the emotions, that the emotions should have been there in some ways, and that we should get to know each other.

Victor: Yeah, I think that was the main thing, was to go out and enjoy ourselves. Go out there and see London together. There are so many things to do. Mother was really encouraging us to have that period of getting to know each other.

Purna: She even wanted us to go and do the Kathak classes together.

Victor: This was another very interesting thing. When I went back to Italy, I went on and did various things. I did some work from time to time in theater. And then, two years later, Mother one day said to me, "Are you ready to get married now?" And I said, "Yes, Mother." The real question, which didn't even cross my mind at the time, was what it implied: "Do you have a job? Do you have an income? Can you look after her?" All of these things hadn't occurred to me. So I just said, "Yes, of course." I thought she was saying, "Are you prepared to go ahead with it?" I said, "Yes, of course, Mother," because nothing was set at all. There weren't the conditions for that.

It's quite interesting; in those days, you just got married and then got your act together and became more serious. I think that that was it. It was just very, very beautiful and magical. And Mother's maternal care and love and attention... you wonder how that could even be possible. And then you hear all the other stories, and everybody's stories, thousands of stories, and you wonder how that could have happened in one single lifetime. Mother touched so many lives and sorted so many people out. She had time, without ever making anybody feel that she was in a rush. The attention was entirely on you at that given moment. It's just divine and unbelievable. And a blessing to try and live up to, because it's not like you deserve it. It's an opportunity for growth and development, and you just have to embrace it and count your blessings. And I'm grateful we're here. That's the story.
