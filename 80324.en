Talk Language: English | Transcript (English) - In Progress

Yesterday, I spoke in our national language, but today they have requested Me that I should speak in English. So I hope you'll excuse Me for using this foreign language. It is very difficult to describe the experiences of the Spirit in this language.

You'll be amazed to know that in this country, right from the language, everything has been discovered through meditations. It has been found out by great Rishis and Munis and they have later on prescribed it for the society. This is a very unique country where all that is knowledge comes to us through the people who really know the real knowledge, while from all other countries, most of the philosophical treaties are not through meditation so much, but more from the experiments they used or experiments that they tried on human beings from outside. Knowledge does not come from outside because whatever is outside is already known. Knowledge comes from inside. Every knowledge, every part of knowledge that we see today has come to us from inside.

Inside ourselves, as I told you yesterday, there is a universal being which is now been accepted by many scientists and many psychologists. They call it as an Universal Unconscious Being that resides within us. They accept that all the harmony that we learn, all the balances that we achieve come to us from the instructions that we receive from this universal unconscious.

So far, they have not been able to jump into that Universal Unconscious. Though they have been able to see, perceive, imagine the existence of that, they have not been able, so far, to find out a method by which they could jump or trigger their beings to be in that Universal Unconscious.

The conscious mind that is within us, by which you are listening to Me, has got on the right-hand side, the pre-conscious mind and the left-hand side the subconscious mind. The conscious mind receives every moment to moment the experiences, and the pre-conscious
mind passes it either to the subconscious mind or to the intelligence, whatever may be the case. The Universal Unconscious is beyond the conscious mind. The only way to achieve it is to be in the conscious mind, that is to be in the present. Now at this moment to be where you are, which is an impossibility.

If I give you a big lecture that you try to be on this moment or now at this moment to be here, you cannot do it. You say, "Mother how to do it? It's very difficult". It is, because you are not yet made that way, as I have described yesterday, that there is something that has to be still brought into your being, that will create a new dimension in your awareness, by which you could be in that Universal Unconscious. And that defect - I would not say defect, but I would say in completion in our being that we are not yet evolved to that point, where we could be in our conscious mind and jump into our unconscious, being conscious. And at this moment, I am in the conscious mind, and I am also in the unconscious mind. That is very easily possible if you could somehow or other be triggered into it. That is the job of Sahaja Yoga and Sahaja Yoga is working it out.

In the medical terminology, you can say that you jump into your parasympathetic nervous system. Parasympathetic nervous system is the system by which we supply the energy that we use, by which we balance ourselves, by which harmonize ourselves.
For example, if our heart is beating hard, or we can make it beat hard, we can think about a state of emergency by which the heart can pump faster. But gradually, it slows down by itself. By itself! They say it is ‘autonomous’, that is ‘swayam chalit’. Somebody, ‘swayam’, ‘auto’ is doing it.

Now who is that auto? They have not been able to define, just giving a name. This auto is nothing else but the Spirit that is being described in all the great scriptures of the universe. And this Self once comes into the conscious mind, enlightens your conscious mind, then you get what you call these vibrations known as Chaitanya Lahiri by Adi Shankaracharya. Of course, these days, the Shankaracharya’s are only busy with their pujas and all that. None of these people, none of these people right from the Pope, the Mullahs and the pundits and all these people are at all bothered about the reality of religion, but they are just worried about all kinds of ritualism, what we call as ‘karmakanda’.

And Kabira, Nanaka, so many before that, Tukarama, and earlier also from right from Moses and Abraham from that time, they have been lashing at these people that, "Don't take to these false, hypocritical, absolutely out of any reality these methods of getting money out of you or getting some power out of you".

This Self-realization, as they call it, has also gone into lots of funny human distortions. They have used it in so many ways that it's sometimes shocking the way how human beings have been so arrogant and not afraid of God's own power. The way they have been going and spoiling the reality of Self-realization. But thank God, in this country, we have had many people, great many people who have described it very clearly. For example, let us take Adi Shankaracharya. We are supposed to be Hindus, supposed to be. That doesn't mean ‘Hindu Maha Saba’, in any way. Those great people like Adi Shankaracharya have described that when a person gets connected with the Self, the light of the Self, flows through you as Saundarya Lahari. He calls them as ‘Chaitanya’ [unclear].

At the time of Christ, it is described in the Bible that, when somebody touched his body, a power of love went into the another person, and another person was cured. This is what it is the parasympathetic nervous system within us, which we cannot bring into play ourselves with our efforts. It works automatically, autonomously. That's why it is called an autonomous nervous system.

If you could, by any chance, by any method, by the grace of God, because if you take the name of God, after, doctors don't believe in it. If you could jump into that parasympathetic nervous system, then you become the master of that controlling force. You become the master of that Self, that is yourself. That means you become master of yourself.

Yesterday, as I described that any amount of variations, and any amount of varieties of your institutions, human institutions, of say, law, order, political institutions, your economic institutions, your social institutions, any type and any sorts of these are just experiments in the darkness. And they cannot be complete and integrated and they cannot bring forth any correlation between human relations, and the ideals that they present. There is no relationship between these two things.

For example, people talk of communism. They'll talk of communism and they themselves will be enjoying a very luxurious life. If they cannot by force, then in their hearts, they must be wanting it, they must be feeling tempted. They are not enjoying that giving away or that collective distribution.

Now if you see the capitalist, as you call them, the capitalist also, they cannot enjoy the capital that they have. As soon as they have little more capital than they have, immediately as in Marathi they say that, [Marathi]. The capitalists start flowing in various ways, like they start getting drunk, the money flows to dirty women, goes to all kinds of various self-destroying agents. Knowingly they jump into them. That means even with wealth there is nothing that happens inside. A man, if by money, he could get better, then, I think, most of the affluent countries should have been very happy places. But as I told you yesterday, that the maximum number of suicides in the countries like Sweden which is the most affluent.

So, a person belonging to this wise country of ours, where wisdom has been the basis of all our social and our economic and our political institutions should turn back to that wisdom and find out why. Why is it that all these so-called evolutionary methods that we had, by which we think we have evolved ourselves socially, we have evolved ourselves economically, we are affluent, we have learned to build nice houses and all that, still why are we so barbaric? Why do we get into wars? Why do we have this self-destroying element? Nowhere in the animal kingdom they have such huge great self-destroying institutions, as we have among ourselves thanks to our intelligence and thanks to our wisdom. It's high time that we sit down and think about it.

Perhaps, I was born with this, and I thought of it and I knew the reason was that man has not known the reality, he has not known himself. Because of this single imperfection in him, he is unable to accept, to identify with the ideals that he proclaims. The whole human race, if you find individually, a person is capable of anything: he can kill his conscience, whatever may be his ‘samskaras’[predisposition], he can become anything that he wants to be. Now the question of freedom, as I discussed yesterday, is that, if man is given freedom then how does he behave? You can see all the free countries, God save them, I don't know where they'll be landing themselves. Already they are in the end, already they are in the end.
With all these things in your view, we should stop and think. And then we understand that there is some missing link within us. The evolutionary process is not yet completed. Let us going for that, let us see if it works out, and if I say "Yes, Sahaja Yoga can work it out", please open your hearts to it. It is for your good.

But human beings, I don't understand sometimes, they go after things by which all their powers are reduced. For example they'll go to some gurus who will take away their money, their wives, everything. If anything doesn't materialize, then the gurus will destroy them completely. But still they'll be sticking on to such gurus.

Now take to any other thing. Like, say, for example, economic growth or say any political institutions or any sort of a, I would call it everything is nothing but a kind of a fascist attitude towards oneself. For example, you say that, "I am a democrat" or "I am a socialist", "I am a Hindu", "I am a Muslim". "I am this thing". All these are misidentifications and falsehoods. But you stick on to all of them, and you club together very easily to that. But you are not willing to accept the real being within yourself which is universally one, and by which you become that.

You are not to be told about it. You are one, you are part and parcel of one Being and can be established and you can see for yourself and feel it. Only thing, open your hearts to it. You read some books. I have met some people who have read Gita. They talk Gita as if they are Vyasa muni themselves, or I don't know, they are Krishna themselves. I told them, "Did you write Gita? Did you get any experience of Gita? Why are you giving lectures on Gita? "
They will sit down, give a big lecture, people will go and they’ll say, "Oh what a nice thing he’s now talking". All mental feats going on, helping themselves to destroy their mental activity.
No wonder in the West, most of the people I find them mad and stupid. Too much mental activity like that going on is self-destroying. There is no balance, there is no integration between their various selves that are physical, mental, emotional and spiritual. It’s only possible if you could awaken into your Self. So the question comes in, "How Mother, we have to do it? " And I said, "It's a very easy thing because you are built in for that, it is built into you and is the Kundalini".

In my last lectures, which will be starting I think from the 26th and 27th or 28th, 3 days, I'll be giving you the complete picture of that engineering that is within us all built in. Only thing, the job is to put it to the mains. Once you are put to the mains, how do you know and how do you co-relate with your human element to the rest of the world? For example the vibrations start flowing through you. Then what happens? Now some of you yesterday got Realization, some of them have come back, some of them have not even bothered to come back. Not even understanding that such a great thing has happened to them. Tomorrow if they contact cancer, "Mataji you must cure us, we have got cancer ". Cancer can only be cured if you know your Self. Otherwise, it cannot be cured. Take it from Me. I've been saying this, on this platform, for the last seven years. But nobody has paid any heed to it. But even doctors, when they get cancer, they come to Me for treatment.

Your Self has to be touched by something. All right, then what happens? When the light of that Self, flows through you, the vibrations start flowing through you. You start getting cool vibrations in your hand. Now how are you to know that now these are the vibrations that are from the Self? You put the same hands on somebody else. On these fingers, you start feeling the tingling on various fingers. And you start feeling tingling here, or tingling here, or you may start getting cool breeze from the another person. You'll be amazed that all these fingers here and on this left and right-hand side are denoting, are coded with your sympathetic nervous system, left and right.

Left-side, doctors won't accept it, you see they won't accept. They can't cure, but they won't accept. The left-hand side is connected with your emotional self. And right-hand side is connected with your physical and with your mental self. But also left-hand side, on the upper region, is connected with your spiritual needs.

Now supposing you put your hands on somebody, even a child, I have a grandchild who is now about one year old, but even when she was six months old she could immediately tell Me, "This man is got up here or here or here".
Now this one means on the left-hand side, on this cervical plexus, there is a catch. Even a child! You can put ten children together, tie them up and ask them to feel the vibrations and they will put, all of them will put the same fingers, because this does not need any knowledge. You know this is burning, this is becoming heavy or this is becoming breezy.

For this, you don't have to have any language. Without any language, you can make it up. These are the laws of God's kingdom. These are different types. They have no language as such, but they are definite laws and absolutely scientific. In the sense, that in the science there might be a mistake ,but in Sahaja Yoga there cannot be any mistake whatsoever. Maybe the instrument that is working may not be perfect, so may make a mistake. But if the instrument is all right, you can see that whatever is found out is there. Now among us, we have many people who have experimented, not only experimented, but they have also cured people of mental and physical illness.

But the trouble with human beings today, especially with our country people now, I am dealing with them, that now after becoming the developing countries, I don't know what we mean by that, we start taking to ego orientation. We have to work up our ego, we must work hard, we must do this, we must compete with each other, we must come up.
The ego starts developing and the ego is such a disease that one cannot feel the disease at all. It's such an aggressive disease. I must do better than the other person, I must push him down, I must do somehow. All competitive life is ego-oriented. In the West, of course, the ego orientation has gone into superego, that means they have started taking to drugs and receiving from life, while here now we are going their way. When we'll go headlong into the same ditch, we may start doing the same thing. But why not short circuit the whole process? The ego orientation starts by which we the Indians have started doing things, accepting things which the West has done, as I told you yesterday.

Now these you can feel it on your hands. Diabetes is one of the outcomes of ego orientation. Diabetes we have cured and we can cure. But we are not a curing institution, no. We don't believe in curing. We believe in giving them Self-realization.

Then the people who are ego oriented, they are suffering also from kidney trouble, from liver trouble and you trust them. Diabetes is caused, it’ a simple reason, if I tell you you'll be surprised because if there's a doctor he can’t understand it, because they don't know about it so far.
There is one center which we call as Swadhistan center which is a subtle center in the backbone, which is manifesting through our aortic plexus, in front in the gross way. It converts the fat of the stomach to become the fat cells in the brain. Doctors don't think from where this fat cell comes into the brain, how does it come through, how does it evolve from an ordinary fat cell to the thinking fat cell. This cell is doing this work. But a man who is thinking, planning, ego-oriented sort of a competitive gentleman, he does not understand that he needs a balance for his Swadhistana chakra. The same Swadhistana chakra is supplying the liver, the pancreas, the also the kidneys and the uterus as I told you. When one instrument or say one thing that has to- say you take one dynamo and it is being used only for running the fan. Then there will be no electricity available for other things. In the same way, it happens that people who use this energy too much, they develop a diabetic temperament.

The ego orientation can lead further on. Further on in this way, that supposing you start using your right-side too much. Then the balance has to come to the left-hand side. Most surprising thing is, that when you exert your physical being too much, you get a heart attack. Actually heart has nothing to do with your physical being, if you see that, because heart is more emotional. But if you do too much of emotional exertion, for example somebody cries a lot all the time crying too much, he gets a brain trouble, means he is mentally deranged. The balance comes at a later stage, and that's how these days you will find all these so-called organizers, and the bureaucrats are suffering from this trouble that is known as heart attack.

You have to have balance. You have to balance yourself. If you are a balanced person, if you are in the center, not doing too much extreme of anything, you are the best suited for Sahaja Yoga. But supposing you are not. Still, balance could be given because the Chaitanya that is flowing through all the Sahaja Yogis, they can push the ego on one side and raise the left-hand
side and bring it to the back. You can be given Realization also, because they can raise the Kundalini, the Kundalini rises. It comes out of the Brahmarandhra here, and you become universally unconscious. You jump into that where you become really a universally conscious personality.

All this happens to you no doubt. But whatever happens to you, you must verify and experiment within. With steadiness, if you go about, then you can master the complete thing.
Now we have among ourselves here some people who have cured all kinds of diseases, even
Cancer. But that doesn't mean bring all the diseased people to Me. There are lots of hospitals where I can go and if I enter a hospital you'll be surprised there will be thousands of people coming to Me. But for Realization, there'll be only fifty. Everybody wants to take the benefit of it but the biggest and the greatest benefit of Sahaja Yoga is to know your Self, to know your power. Instead of running after things which do not give you any power, why don't you take to something that gives you your own power?

But the trouble with the people, as I told you, they want to run after things that take away their power. Somebody mesmerizes you? That's the best guru they have got. You must have heard about some gurus who are these days busy sabotaging you. I was amazed, in Bihar, I met a relation of mine. She told Me, "Mataji I pray to you, I fall at your feet". I said, "What do you want?" She said, "You know, my guru is in jail, please see that he's released". I said, "Very good!"
Under their spell they are just moving, "I am in joy, I am in happiness, I am very happy". This is not the sign of Self-realization at all. "I am very peaceful". If, you see, if you take some drink, you'll feel peaceful. In the same way, somebody puts a spirit into your head or if you are under somebody's head, you are going to feel peaceful. That is not the reality. Ask for the reality. If you are the seekers of truth then ask for the truth and the truth is what about your own powers?

Have you felt your own power? Have you tried another's? Have you worked it out? And do you know all the knowledge about it? Why go after something that is falsehood? Now supposing I give you a coin of gold, and that is not, I should say, gold but something else. What will you say? "What Mataji has given me is nothing useless, worthless, I throw it out". But in your spiritual life why do you accept? Why do you go after something that is not reality? Why are you satisfied in such things? It is beyond my understanding.

So before you, as a Mother, I stand with folded hands requesting you to open yourselves to truth and accept it. Because these are the worst times and the best times. We are at the cusp.
At this time if you catch up with the truth, the truth will be shown all over the world. If you do not, of course, there is going to be deluge, no doubt, but you will be held responsible, because at this time you are there.

You are not responsible for anything else today if you think it. See now, you must have seen that people who go to Congress, turn to Janta, from Janta to Congress, from here to there, and they don't know where they are. In the same way, in your everyday working also, you join one job, then you give up, you take up another job, then you give it up, then you take up another job. In your possessions also, you buy something, leave that, take up something, take up another thing. That means you do not feel that it is something good or worth it, or you do not feel much responsible about it. But one thing you must know that there is something eternal within you. You are made for that. You are for that. Only thing, you have to expose yourself to that joy. It is your own right. It is your own asking, and it is the grace of God for which He has created you from amoeba, with his care and gentleness and love to this human level.

We know how every day we are destroying ourselves. Now if I tell you, "Don't drink any alcohol". You won't listen to Me, I know, you cannot. Poor that Mr. Muradji has been criticized by all of you. Everybody has been criticized. But you know that it goes against your awareness. You know all that, but I don't want to tell you because I know you cannot do it. Because you are not yet that powerful to do it. But by Sahaja Yoga, once you become Realized, you just don't do it. And if you do it you know what happens, you get a catch. If you drink even once, you get a catch and you don't want to do it. You cannot smoke, automatically. Because if you smoke your Vishudhi chakra catches and you can see.

Because by Sahaja Yoga, you start seeing all your centres, you start feeling them. You start seeing within yourself what you are, and what mistakes there are and how. Supposing there is a man who is a very, very ugly personality, who is very much against life. We can say some of these horrible gurus or some other. You won't even see their photographs! Because as soon as you see their photographs, you are getting a heat from them, and you say, "Get out, shut it".
Because your body will start discriminating [Marathi]. You start discriminating very easily what is truth, what is not truth.

Now the question is whether there is God or not. "Basically, there is", if I say, and you say "There isn’t", you are correct and I ‘m also correct. The reason is, once you are Realized, you can find out, you can put your hands and try to find out, "Is there God or not?" Just ask this question, and you will be amazed, vibrations will start flowing into you, and your Spirit will be answering to you and you will know that there is God. But you ask about some X, Y, Z, who is claiming to be God, immediately all the vibrations will stop, and you will know it is not.
