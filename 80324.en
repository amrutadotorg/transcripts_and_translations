Yesterday, I spoke in our national language but today they have requested Me that I should speak in English. So I hope you'll excuse Me for using this foreign language. It is very difficult to describe the experiences of the Spirit in this language.

You'll be amazed to know that in this country, right from the language, everything has been discovered through meditations. It has been found out by great Rishis and Munis and they have later on prescribed it for the society. This is a very unique country where all that is knowledge comes to us through the people who really know the real knowledge, while from all other countries, most of the philosophical treaties are not through meditation so much, but more from the experiments they used or experiments that they tried on human beings from outside.

Knowledge does not come from outside because whatever is outside is already known. Knowledge comes from inside. Every knowledge, every part of knowledge that we see today has come to us from inside.

Inside ourselves, as I told you yesterday, there is a universal being which is now been accepted by many scientists and many psychologists. They call it as an Universal Unconscious Being that resides within us. They accept that all the harmony that we learn, all the balances that we achieve come to us from the instructions that we receive from this universal unconscious.

So far, they have not been able to jump into that Universal Unconscious. Though they have been able to see, perceive, imagine the existence of that, they have not been able, so far, to find out a method by which they could jump or trigger their beings to be in that Universal Unconscious.

The conscious mind that is within us, by which you are listening to Me, has got on the right-hand side, the pre-conscious mind and the left-hand side the subconscious mind. The conscious mind receives every moment to moment the experiences, and the pre-conscious
mind passes it either to the subconscious mind or to the intelligence, whatever may be the case. The Universal Unconscious is beyond the conscious mind. The only way to achieve it is to be in the conscious mind, that is to be in the present. Now at this moment to be where you are, which is an impossibility.

If I give you a big lecture that you try to be on this moment or now at this moment to be here, you cannot do it. You say, "Mother how to do it? It's very difficult". It is, because you are not yet made that way, as I have described yesterday, that there is something that has to be still brought into your being, that will create a new dimension in your awareness, by which you could be in that Universal Unconscious. And that defect - I would not say defect, but I would say in completion in our being that we are not yet evolved to that point, where we could be in our conscious mind and jump into our unconscious, being conscious. And at this moment, I am in the conscious mind, and I am also in the unconscious mind. That is very easily possible if you could somehow or other be triggered into it. That is the job of Sahaja Yoga and Sahaja Yoga is working it out.

In the medical terminology, you can say that you jump into your parasympathetic nervous system. Parasympathetic nervous system is the system by which we supply the energy that we use, by which we balance ourselves, by which harmonize ourselves.
For example, if our heart is beating hard, or we can make it beat hard, we can think about a state of emergency by which the heart can pump faster. But gradually, it slows down by itself. By itself! They say it is ‘autonomous’, that is ‘swayam chalit’. Somebody, ‘swayam’, ‘auto’ is doing it.

Now who is that auto? They have not been able to define, just giving a name. This auto is nothing else but the Spirit that is being described in all the great scriptures of the universe. And this Self once comes into the conscious mind, enlightens your conscious mind, then you get what you call these vibrations known as Chaitanya Lahiri by Adi Shankaracharya. Of course, these days, the Shankaracharya’s are only busy with their pujas and all that. None of these people, none of these people right from the Pope, the Mullahs and the pundits and all these people are at all bothered about the reality of religion, but they are just worried about all kinds of ritualism, what we call as ‘karmakanda’.
