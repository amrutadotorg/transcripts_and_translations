Then there's Victoria, Felicity, Inge, and Alan Morrissey. Yes. So, we can start with Mira. She's been on the marriage committee for so long and she has so many experiences with Shri Mataji that she can tell us a lot about.

Can you hear me? Can you hear me well?

Yes.

Okay. First of all, thank you very much for being again in this beautiful group to share with you all our experiences. And first of all, I would like to make a request, because the IMC is collecting stories and happenings about marriages—how it was in earlier times with Shri Mataji. Everyone could perhaps send me their stories because we are going to have a booklet for the 100-year anniversary of Shri Mataji. So this is our plan. We need all your beautiful stories which we can use (of course, not those which are not possible to use). That would be my request, and maybe I will send an email address from the IMC for these collections. If that would be possible, that would be great.

We are very happy to share. We had a great session recently about marriage testimonies; it was a wonderful evening a few months ago.

For what I can say today, I was asked about my experiences with Shri Mataji in preparing for the marriages. I tried to write it down because it was a really very special moment. In the summer of 2000, I was in the castle and worked there as usual; that was my duty. I lived for a time in Cantarana, and it happened a few days before Ganesha Puja. I just went out of the kitchen and suddenly Yogi Mahajan arrived. He was in charge of marriages in India and also in Cabella for a few years, and he just asked me for a cup of tea. So I went and prepared the tea for him, and we were sitting there. He was talking about the work that had to be done for the upcoming marriages, and then he asked me to help him with the work.

Of course, it was an honor for me and also a challenge because I had to work with Shri Mataji in those days. There were also some folders with applications, and we were sitting in a room, in an office in the castle. He asked me to give him an application from a boy or a girl, age-wise. I just remember I went to the folders and picked out a girl and another one, a boy, and then I gave it to him.

It was very interesting for me to see the vibration work that went on. He just went into meditation with both of the forms. Then sometimes he'd ask, "Okay, for another one," and then he went to Shri Mataji. She was just sitting in a room nearby. Everything was very, very quiet, very, very deep. It was a huge vibration work. I don't remember if anyone else was there—only Shri Mataji, Mahajan, and me.

So then he went to Shri Mataji with the applications. Shri Mataji took both of them and she just observed the photos. Mostly she was just watching the yogis; she was not much interested in what they were doing or what their height was. Then sometimes she'd say, "Okay, give me another girl." So I was running back and took another girl's application. And then she would just say, "Okay, it's a match," or she said, "It's done," or "Give me another boy," or "Give me another girl." So the work went on and on for three days long.

I just remember I was not on earth, I think. It was so much work, but I didn't feel tired. Somehow, for three days I didn't sleep, and I don't remember if I ate anything. And she was just sitting there and worked very, very hard. So that was the beginning of the work.

Later on, I helped in general with applications, and then the main work started in 2011 when the IMC was founded by the CC. Actually, Gregoire was very much interested that we have this group all together. These days it's a little bit different because we have so many applications from all over the world. We are around 16 active members, and this year we even managed to take vibrations online for six days long, also from early morning until the night. What is nice is that this time we have a much higher agreement on the matches, so this is also very good, even in India. We have more than 70 percent who agreed with the matches. And of course, we had a tremendous weekend at Krishna Puja with the marriages last week.

So, what more to say? If someone has a question...

It was such a joyful experience watching; we all watched online. Wow. We hope this will continue, this tradition of broadcasting. This is so wonderful, and we all felt so one. The sense of oneness we could feel was amazing.

It was incredible because we have many who were born and grew up in Sahaja Yoga who got married, and that was very, very special. To see them and also to match them—this work was also incredible. We just saw, "Oh, this boy! Oh, this girl!" and the vibrations were just working. It works. So it was actually easy work to do this year.

Perfect, these matches. They were really perfect. I know quite a few of the youngest who I've known since they were babies. Yes, it's just so perfect. I just can't really describe how beautiful it was to see them, actually perfect matches. This year, I guess we had many, many.

And what is most beautiful is when you see marriages from previous years and now we have so many babies walking or just born. It's incredible. We just see babies in Cabella, so this is the other nice part. We hope very much we can continue and that this work will always be very auspicious for the sangha.

It's a beautiful team also. We are friends, sisters, family. We are sometimes talking, meditating. Also, if someone has a problem, we share together. It's an incredible deepness between the members. After 10 years of work, almost all of us have been there for a long time and also worked with Shri Mataji—of course more than me, probably Mr. Nagikar and others. Dania loves it. We missed her this year; she could not come. But she completely loves the group, she's just amazing. We love each other very much, I have to say. This makes it easier because we are one. If you have a work and you have a oneness, then that's the most beautiful. I would say this group is probably the most beautiful in Sahaja Yoga, maybe also others, but this group is excellent.

So that's it for me. And please, please send me the stories what you have, especially from the earlier times. We will try to make it in a chronological way—how the marriages started and how many stories there are, just to share and enjoy. We have some already, and it would be great... maybe I will write the email address in the chat.

Very nice, yes.

Okay, thank you. Thank you for letting me share about the marriage committee and how it came into being.

Very nice. Thank you, Mira. Thank you. Very nice, yes. Thank you and congratulations to you also.

Okay, so next we have... who will go next? Felicity, I think you might be one of the earliest marriages.

Yes, it's interesting you were asking, Mira. I just first wanted to say, because our son got married this weekend at Krishna Puja, and I was just trying to say to Victoria, thank you really so much. We weren't able to be there, any of the family at all. It's Mataji's Maya. And it was so beautiful to see how loved and taken care of he was, and they all were, the couples. We had such a strong sense of the Sahaj family through watching the whole marriages online. I wanted to thank the marriage committee for all the hard work and everything that they've done to bring about such a joyful occasion. I had never seen him so joyful. It was just... and it reminded us, my husband and I, of when we got married. When we got married in 1982, we got married in India and we had no family there. Nobody had a Sahaj family then, so it was a similar experience for him.

So when we got married... I came into Sahaja Yoga in 1979. In '80, Dawn and Tony were the first marriage, and then Maureen. I think Gretchen will remember dates better. But '81 was when Shri Mataji started having more collective weddings, collective marriages. We got married in '82, and it was the first collective marriage in Delhi, in India. There were 12 couples, but it was a very different situation. We were on tour, there were about 84 yogis on tour, a lot of Australians. Suddenly, we were on the tour with Shri Mataji and we were sitting somewhere listening with her, and she suddenly said, "And where is the marriage list? Pull out the marriage list. Please stand up."

There were about 27 people on the marriage list. We had just sent in our names. They all stood up. Mother saw where they were, and we all sat down again. Then she started to proceed to talk about each person, and many of them she'd never physically met before. But for each person, she said some really good quality about them, and if there was some weakness, she also shared that. It was very, very open; everything was up front. She was basically introducing all the people on the marriage list to the collective and to everyone else on the marriage list. We actually have a recording somewhere on tape.

And then, when she'd spoken about everyone, she said, "And now I want you to go away and put down on a piece of paper who you would like to marry." We just went, "What? What?" I was like, "No, no, this is not my... I'm waiting for Mother to tell me who to marry." So she said, "You put down three names and then you bring the pieces of paper." For me, I went away and I thought, "Ah, I can't choose. I know only Mother knows." To this point, I knew that only she could know the right person for me because she knows everything.

Anyway, I sort of went through... I had to sit and think about all the men on the list because Mother said that. I picked out two or three people that I knew didn't quite feel right. When my attention went to my future husband, I just went, "No way, totally unsuited." I didn't even think any more about him. It was just like, "No." I'd had a couple of conversations, I thought we're totally opposite, that's not going to work.

So imagine my shock. I got a little bit nervous. The next day, we didn't hear anything. Then the next day, my husband, Richard, tells the story that Warren was running backwards and forwards from Mother's house to the camp, talking to people. He would be saying, "Will you accept this match that has been made?" I just suddenly got cold feet and I went to him and I said, "I don't... I can't do this. You'll have to take my name off the list. I'm not ready." And he went, "Oh, really? Mother's found a match for you." So I went, "Okay... who is it?" And he said, "Richard."

I was just like, "Richard!" I must have gone away and thought about it, and then I came back to him and I said, "Is Mother happy about the match?" And he said, "Yes, yes, she's very happy about the match." So then I just said, "Okay." If this is the match... and once I accepted and surrendered to it, then it was like she showed me inside myself why this is a good match.

We weren't allowed to talk to each other for more than two minutes. The matches came together very quickly. Six of them were rematches—people who were already married, had come into Sahaja Yoga married, and had asked for a remarriage. There were only six other matches that came together. And it was 10 days from that point of engagement to when we actually went to Delhi and had the marriage ceremonies. She said to us, "You can only speak for two minutes each day," and I'm sure this was just so that our egos and our superegos didn't come up and start judging each other.

I remember standing in the dinner line. I thought, "Okay, we can't talk, but we can be together." So it was very sweet. I can remember standing with him in the dinner line, and you really have a sense of the spirit of the person. You don't have any complications from conversations or talking; you just feel the spirit of the person. I suddenly felt Mother inside me say, "See, you are two halves of the same coin. One is the heads, one is the tail, and together you make one." I felt her say to me inside, "You are very different on the outside, but inside you share the same values. The deep things are the same. And over the years, the outside things will all smooth away and melt away, and gradually you will become more in the center together. And then you will just enjoy." And that is what happened.

It was very sweet. And just one little other thing. For the saris for the marriages, Shri Mataji had arranged for someone to come. We were all invited down to where this table was laid out with wedding saris, and all the brides were invited to come down and choose a sari. My friend Pamela was there; she also got married that year to a Swiss man. She found this amazing sari. It was completely multi-colored, filled with gold and silver and colors of the rainbow. All the other saris were fairly subdued, you know, reds and greens, some pinks. She came and she said to me, "Oh, what do you think?" I went, "Oh, Pamela, I think this is a bit much. It's a bit loud." She said, "I really like it." So she held on to this sari. I couldn't choose, and people said to me, "Oh, you should take this pink one," so I picked up a pink one.

Then we were standing in a line, and Shri Mataji was there. Each bride came up to her holding the sari they had chosen. My friend Pamela was in front of me. She got to Shri Mataji and Mother went, "No, no, no, not this sari," and put it down. My ego must have thought, "Oh, yeah, right." And she picked out a different one, a very lovely green one for her. Then it was my turn, and I went up. I felt this pink one was too much associated with the left side and stuff. And she said, "No, no, not this one," and she picked up the multi-colored one and she gave it to me. She said, "Do you like it?" And I just kind of went, "Yes, Mother, yes." I went, "Gulp," of course. You're just sort of reprocessing and adjusting. It was Mother's a wonderful joke, and how she breaks down your conditionings and ideas. It was an amazing sari for me because there was nothing from my past or my being that could identify in any way with this sari. It was like being given a completely new, joyful skin. Just an incredible sari. So those experiences of being with her... her attention to the detail, to the smallest things, how she knew us through and through. She knows all of us through and through.

That was part of our experience. We got married in Delhi. We did have the Gauri Puja. I remember coming out; we didn't have the big sheet like you have now. We were given the garlands as we came out of the room where we'd been having the puja with Shri Mataji. She gave the brides the garlands, and we then came out and met our future husbands and garlanded them and started the ceremony. Meanwhile, I shouldn't forget to say, the grooms arrived on horses, as is traditional in India. They could only find 11 horses for 12 grooms! My husband should tell that story. But you can see there is a video where you see them arriving. Shri Mataji came by and blessed us all and congratulated us and gave us some gifts, each couple.

I just add one little thing. Before that, in '79, '80, we were again with Shri Mataji in her flat in Victoria Gardens. She'd been talking about everyday, sort of more mundane things, maybe programs. And then suddenly the atmosphere changed, and she started to talk to us about marriage, about how important it was. At that time, the only married couples were Jim and Hilary, and Gavin and Jane who'd come into Sahaja Yoga married. None of the rest of us were married, and we were all fairly young, in our mid-20s, some early 30s.

She really stressed the importance that we all had to get married. She actually said, "Anybody who doesn't want to get married in Sahaja Yoga can just get out. Just get out. That's it." And I could feel... I just remember it as being so historic to me. I remember her sitting on her chair, framed with the window and the light was coming in, and she seemed so large. We were all at her feet on the ground. She said, "You are the foundation stones I'm building Sahaja Yoga upon. But I'm sending you the children, and they are the ones that are going to change the world." She also talked about the schools.

I never forgot that. This weekend at Krishna Puja, when we saw these amazing children, so many of them who've grown up in Sahaja Yoga and are just so joyful, so many of them who'd been to the school at ISPS... at that same time, she said to us, "I am building you a school, and you will send your children there." And these are the children that came through from there. It's such a thing to see so many things she promised us in those early years of what would happen and how things would change. And I have to say that two-thirds have already come true. To see these generations now getting married and, as you said, having their own children, and us being grandparents, which is amazing. And even for those children who have gone out of the collective, you still see how shining they are in their lives, however they've chosen to lead them. I feel as if wherever they are, whether they're in the Sahaj collective or they're outside, these are Mother's children. And they are just shining and leading the life and giving the vibrations that she bestowed upon all of them.

Very nice. Thank you, Felicity. Yes, these are indeed very precious stories from the earliest weddings. Very nice. So now we have two more, Inge and Victoria. Should we start with Inge? And Alan Morrissey and Felicity, I hope one day Richard...
