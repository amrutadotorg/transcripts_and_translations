Yes, Shri Mataji stayed with us in Bristol for the night, and then we went on to Exeter. In one day, Shri Mataji held a little puja with about 12 people, did a television interview, and then in the evening did a public program. After that, she decided she wanted to go back to Bristol again. So I set out with Mother; she said, "Come with me."

Just after we set out, I realised that Chris, my husband, had the key to our house. So I said, "Mother, my husband's got the key." She said, "Let's go back." So we went back. We hadn't been gone long, but he'd already left with Linda Pearce and, I think, her son, Datta.

Meanwhile, we went back to Bristol and arrived at the old vicarage. This was a big house where we had a flat. We couldn't get in because Chris hadn't turned up with the key. So we waited for a while. He didn't turn up. This went on for some time, and various things happened. Mother got me to try her keys in the door.

Time passed, and I was thinking, "Gosh, what are we going to do?" Mother went to sleep in the front seat. All sorts of things were going through my mind. Eventually, she woke up again and said, "Why don't we go and get a drink?" So we drove around Bristol for a while, but we couldn't find anywhere to get a drink. Everywhere was shut by that time. But we found a little street vendor in one of these little vans, and we had hot chocolate. I remember that. It was just very nice.

We talked about hot chocolate and whether it was good for your liver. I think it was Nick Kershaw who said, "But what if we've got a bad liver, Mother?" And she said, "Oh, just have it with less milk." She said it's a very good drink to have before you go to bed at night. "But don't have tea after six o'clock," she said. "Don't have tea after six o'clock."

Then we drove around and came back to the house, but they still weren't there. By now it was really, really late; it was like two o'clock in the morning or something. We just didn't know what had happened to Chris and Linda. So I was thinking, "Oh, gosh, what are we going to do?"

Then I remembered another flat in Bristol where my brother was living, where I'd previously lived, which was a very, very humble place. And I was thinking... no, I was living there at the time. Yes. It was very humble. Very humble indeed. There were four of us living in a one-bedroom flat.

So in the end, I said, "Mother, there is another flat we could go to," because I just thought we had to go somewhere for the night. "And Alan lives there." She said, "Oh, let's go there." So we went there. Alan Richards had gone to bed, and he woke up when he heard the front door. He came to the door, and there was Shri Mataji at the front door. It was such a humble place. I mean, in the main bedroom, there was just a mattress on the floor, not even a proper bed.

(The narrative is briefly interrupted by others clarifying details.)

That must have been their first house. This was Hampton Road. No, because I was living there... What happened was the Exeter yogis had put on a meal for everyone after the public program. Most of the yogis went back to this place for a meal, and Ruth had gone off with Mother. This is how I remember it. It would be better if one person tells the story, because I'm going to lose the thread. Okay?

(The interviewer speaks.)

Remind us of the time you're talking about.

(The speaker resumes.)

Yes, this was in... It was before I had my daughter, so it was 1982. In about November, I think. So, we went to this flat, and Mother slept in the bedroom on the mattress on the floor. It was Janet, Ridley, me, and Pam. We all slept in the hall outside Mother's room. And there were a few men, I think—I can't remember who they were—but they were in the sitting room.

In the morning, Mother said, "Oh, where did you sleep?" We said, "In the hall, Mother." And she said, "Oh, you should have slept in here with me."

She had told us to wake her up at 8:30 in the morning, I think it was. So Janet and I went in at 8:30. We hadn't gotten much sleep that night, and we didn't want to wake Mother up. We didn't know how to wake Mother up. We just went in and we bowed down, and we both fell asleep. So we were—bowed down on the floor, fast asleep. Eventually, Mother woke up.

Mother said, "Go and find out what's happened. Where was Chris and everything?" So I went to the phone box, because we didn't have any mobile phones or anything then, and we didn't even have a phone in the flat. I went and phoned Chris, and what had happened was they'd broken down on the motorway. It was Linda Pierce and him and Datta. So by the time they got back, obviously, all this had happened.

And meanwhile, Alan, my brother, had come back to the old vicarage and laid down in his car, sleeping, to wait for someone to turn up. He must have come after Mother had left. Then Chris and Linda came back and went into the flat, not seeing Alan. So Alan spent the night outside the old vicarage, asleep, when he actually lived in the flat that Shri Mataji was sleeping in. And he'd had the desire for her to come to the flat. So it was just so funny, the whole thing. It was a whole comedy of errors. He was sleeping outside the old vicarage, unaware of any of this going on.

(Another person begins to speak.)

The old flat. Where Mother was supposed to be staying with us, where she'd stayed the previous night before we went to Exeter. Well, my version...
