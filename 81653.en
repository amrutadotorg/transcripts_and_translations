 (England)
Okay. We were doing a Havan and a Pooja on the patio outside Shri Mataji's house. Although we had Satpal there, Shri Mataji was leading the whole Pooja and telling us what to do because we didn't have a clue. This is a bit further on in months, and we're all looking a little bit better, a little bit clearer, and wearing more proper clothes. There's Jamal there up in the top right, beside Douglas. Pat is hidden behind Marie, the lady in the red sari. And sitting on the floor with his arm casually on Shri Mataji's knee is Pat's son, Kevin, who was seven at the time and wrote a very beautiful memory of Douglas, if anyone saw it online.

This one was in Acton. We were only there for a very short time, but we were here for—do you know, Pat, was it a year or two years? Something like that. About a year. So you can see Pat and you can see Douglas there quite clearly, and Gregoire and Tony and myself and Christine, and Bogdan on the top left. This was in the meditation room.

It looks like Shri Mataji must have cooked that, because I don't know... it looks like dal to me. Shri Mataji often cooked for us and showed us how to cook. So this must have been 1977 or '78. And this, I believe this is outside Charleston Road or somewhere like that.

"So it could have been one of the seminars, Pat?" "No, I think it is. Isn't it the East Hampstead seminar?" "Yeah, probably East Hampstead, yes. I think you're right. On the steps afterwards."

Yes, I reckon. And Bala's there, and Patricia. And there's Douglas in the green suit. When he went to India, he got suits made for himself in a sort of safari style. He was always very, very well done out, matched in his suits.

"Who's the person in that gorgeous fur coat?" "That's Tony. You know, Tony Cooley, Tony Paniotto. He is still around somewhere."

This looks like it's from the same time because there's Douglas there. It's funny, since Douglas passed away, I get a shock every time I see one of the pictures of him as he was just before he went, because I just keep remembering how he looks there. And his dark hair. And there's Pat in the background, and a little girl called Nonny.

This was on our first trip to India in January 1977. It's Gregoire, of course, and Pat and Tony, myself, Jane, and Douglas. Douglas is slightly in the shade there. This is when we went and visited Gregoire in Kathmandu, where he was working at the time. This was in his garden. We had an amazing time because when we went to India, we were there for three months and we were taken all around by the Sahaja Yogis. And there were always a lot of Sahaja Yogis and a lot of people, which we hadn't come across because in England, there were just the seven of us.

But when we flew to Kathmandu from India, it was just who you see there. We were staying in Gregoire's bungalow with Shri Mataji, and she worked on us. She first showed us how to do Ajwan. Oh, my God. That's right. She got her shawl and she did the Ajwan, and we all had to go underneath her shawl to inhale it with Shri Mataji. She said you must never do this and go out at night; you always had to cover your head and stay indoors because it opened everything out. So that was our first experience of Ajwan. And also, Shri Mataji caught nits from us because we got them from going on the trains.

"Is Gavin taking the photograph?" "Well, Jane usually took the photograph. So in that case, who was it?" "No, Gavin's in the back there. So I think it was his servant that took it, because we're all there, aren't we? What was his name? Tej or something." "Tej, something like that. Yes. Because Marie didn't join us until we went back to Mumbai. It was Marie, the French Sahaja Yogini who brought Pat and I, actually. So I think it must have been his servant."

This was at Bordi, the first time we went there in 1977 for the seminar. We went down to the beach with Shri Mataji and worked things out. I think we stood in the sea, didn't we, Pat? We did all sorts of things. You got very ill because it was so hot.

"Yeah, I did. I went back to our hut, and a couple of hours later, there was a knock on the door and Shri Mataji had come to see how I was. So I had to hop to a chair in my sleeping bag, and my mother came and gave me some vibrations."

We had that havan where they did the thousand names, and they sat us right in front of the fire. As the fruit was going black and melting, I felt like my face was going black and melting. They did the string all the way around Shri Mataji's head and all the way around each of her toes, and she sat there for the whole time as close to the fire as we were.

This is when we went to Varanasi. Everybody was going off the steps and going in the Holy River, but we didn't want to join them. So we hired a boat and went out in the river and then jumped in. I was in there as well in my sari. There's Douglas and Pat and Gavin.

This is actually Shri Mataji's birthday in 1977. We did a puja, do you remember, Pat? And then we went to the cafe afterwards. So we were all blasted. This was when Marie joined us. Yes, that's Marie there in the sari next to me. She was from Paris. We went to Paris in 1980, just before we got married, and stayed in Marie's flat and did the meetings from there.

And this is us waiting on the railway station for a train to come. Douglas is unperturbed as always. I think I was reading something... I was trying to learn Sanskrit. I always remember him with these neckties like he's got there. Yes, the high kerchief. He always did. Very dashing.

This is after an Ajwan session. We had to cover our heads. I think it must have been in Gregoire's place, or else that flat we stayed in in Mumbai. This was in India, definitely. I think this was in Mumbai towards the end, obviously, because Marie's there again. So this is around Mother's birthday puja time.

That's when we went around various sites, wasn't it? Is that Farmer Rowell there on the left, Pat? With the big moustache. We went to the farm in Dhulia and stayed there with Shri Mataji. We did go to Fatehpur Sikri, but before that, we went to Ellora and Ajanta, I think, on this trip. I was ill that time, missed it. We went everywhere in our saris on these beautiful steam trains.

So that was the Red Fort, I think, isn't it, Pat? The one near Agra. You could see the Taj Mahal from there. I thought the Red Fort was in Delhi. Anyway, Shri Mataji made sure that we got to see some amazing things because we were there for three months. A lot of the time she just sent us off. I think now maybe it was to give the poor Sahaja Yogis a break. We just traveled by ourselves. The guy who built the Taj Mahal was imprisoned there, wasn't he, by his son? It was all amazing anyway. Absolutely incredible. This was January to March 1977. We were there from January to Mother's birthday.

This is jumping forward a few years. This will be in Switzerland, June 1984. You can see Douglas there with Diviani. This is in 1984 in Zermatt. This puja, yes. We were all there. And this is at the farm. This is Douglas and Diviani having their lunch. We can share these pictures with you, of course. We can put all the dates on them later on.

Okay, next one. So this is Douglas in India. I think this was their wedding anniversary, with all the Indian yogis. Or Douglas's birthday. When did they go to India? They went to India four years ago, so it would be January 2018. That's the family. One of the people, Deepak, and his wife looked after Douglas in their place. And some Indian yogis. This is Deepak, his son, and his wife, and a friend. That's probably quite recent, a year ago or so. There were lots of people always coming and seeing Douglas because he was a great celebrity in Noida, you see. So they were all coming to see him and they looked after him really well.

Okay, this is a birthday cake in '81. When he was 81. So when he passed away, he was 83. He's just talking about his time with Shri Mataji, and everybody's listening to him. He was really very happy there, always well respected.

And here is his photograph. The last rites will be tomorrow. And after that, he will be cremated, not buried in the ground. This was his wish, so it's going to happen tomorrow. So now, if we can share some memories of Douglas, little things that we remember. We can talk a little bit about when we first met him. Pat first met him before he met Shri Mataji, so he knew him before his realisation.

"Yeah, he used to go to these yoga lessons in Euston, and that's where I got to know him. I'd seen him around, but I didn't know him very well. After the Hatha yoga lessons, we used to go to his flat for tea. There were other people there who became yogis: Jane, Gavin's wife; Christine was around; and Marie and Gus. So quite a few of us knew each other. Douglas had his flat, and he was already a great personality in the area, very gregarious and friendly with everyone. There was a whole community there of new age people who were all eating what Shri Mataji described as concrete or something—their muesli, brown rice. And he used to go around and get all this food and do all kinds of stuff.

When I first met Shri Mataji, the first person I saw was Douglas. And I thought, 'What's he doing here?' It was quite funny, really. I had actually moved away for a few weeks to another part of London, over to Baker Street. During that time, the guy doing the Hatha yoga lessons had met Shri Mataji at the Indian Cultural Centre, and several of the people doing the lessons with him had gone to see her as well. They started having meetings at his house, the Hatha yoga teacher, Mukund Shah. Then they moved to Gavin Brown's place. Maureen and I came to the second or third meeting at Mukund Shah's place, and then they moved to Gavin's. That was September 1975. So we knew Douglas a bit, not that well, but he was quite similar in many ways."

It was interesting because out of those hippies that Mother was meeting with at the yoga classes, it boiled down to the six or seven of us, counting Gregoire as well. Thinking about it, we were all very different, even though some of us had been hippies. Each one of us seemed to epitomize a different sort of person. You can see how Shri Mataji, as she told us later, brought out different aspects of mankind to bring them to Sahaja Yoga.

Douglas was totally unique, I would say. But he represented a certain sort of person who had been through a very hard time. He had such a hard time as a child. He told us some stories but was completely detached about it; he never used to get upset. I believe, Pat, is it correct that he lost his mother in some way and his father was so harsh that he ran away at the age of five?

"Yeah, it was all pretty grim. He lived quite a lonely life, really, although he got involved in things. He belonged to a motorcycle club and drove around on the continent and over around Algeria or somewhere. He said he went right across the Sahara on a motorbike. And he worked in a factory for a long time. When we knew him, he was living in this area where a lot of hippies were squatting. But in the block where he lived, which used to be a council place, he was the only one who kept paying his rent. And eventually, he got rehoused. It was quite smart of him, really, I think.

He had this amazing basement flat, which was like a cross between a flat and a workshop with all kinds of gadgets around. He had his sound system rigged up all around it so he could listen to Capital Radio all the time. He was always fixing things and fiddling with things. He just recognized Mother, and that was it. He latched on to Mother, and that's all he was interested in. He wasn't like a great seeker in an intellectual way at all. But he just had a big heart and he wanted to be happy in life. And when he saw Mother, that was it. He was always there."

He was born in England, in answer to Roslyn. He actually looks quite Indian, but he was born in England. As you all know, he was instrumental in recording. Shri Mataji got us to start the first meetings at Caxton Hall, and it was him that organized all the recordings. He bought his own machines to do it. Then eventually, he spent £600 on a duplicating machine, which was a lot of money at that time—a huge amount. And he just worked all the time, copying tapes for everyone in his flat. There was just this endless whirring noise of this huge contraption and racks of audio tapes all over the walls. That was his mission in life, really.

He was very fastidious about keeping the tapes. He had all these racks, and he was really spot on with them, in good order, date order. He was able to extract the essence of one of Mother's talks and label it like that. And those labels, those names, have continued down the years. You look at it and you go, "Oh yes, I want to hear that one."

I remember him turning up at Caxton Hall not only with the recording equipment but also with boxes of cassettes that we could buy. Later on, when Shri Mataji wasn't always there, he would come and be the one choosing the talk to play. I remember asking him, "Well, how do you know which one to choose?" And he just looked at them and felt vibrationally, "Oh, it's this one," and he just put that one on.

That's an important point, Felicity, because he was the first one to just follow what Mother said and feel vibrations while we were all trying to figure out complicated things about how it all fitted into the history of mankind's seeking and the incarnations and all that. All he would do is just feel the vibrations of anything. He didn't think about things much. He would just come out with what vibrations he felt to deal with any situation.

For me, that was his incredibly unique quality: he just didn't think about things. He was just in the vibrations. The vibrations directed him and dictated. He was surrendered to that, and he was an example in our collective at that time as someone who didn't intellectualize. It's not possible to underestimate the importance of having somebody in the collective who is literally just being that instrument for Mother. You see him and you look at him, and there's that wonderful example, which we used to talk about all the time, about receiving the phone call from David from Time Out magazine.

So, we had advertised in Time Out magazine, which was a kind of seeking magazine. This fellow rang up and started asking Douglas about it. The gist of the story was that I think he was asking what this was all about, and Douglas told us afterwards that he just started raising his Kundalini on the phone. Through the phone, he could feel the vibrations of this person on the other end, and he started raising his Kundalini. Then he said to him, "Oh, have you been doing TM?" And the fellow said, "Oh yeah, yeah, I have. How do you know that?" Douglas knew because Shri Mataji had told us that TM people always caught on the same three chakras: left Swadishthana, left Vishuddhi, and I think it was left Nabhi. Douglas could feel this. He didn't try to engage him in an intellectual conversation; he just showed him, "Oh, well, look, this is what this is. Kundalini comes up and you can feel it."

I got realization in India, in Delhi. It was the tour of 1979 in March, and there were about a dozen Western yogis there. Mother was giving programs every evening in this little tent in the garden of a bungalow in Delhi. I got realization, but I didn't really understand what it was all about. I kept going back each night to the programs. Finally, Douglas said to me, "Oh, we're all going to Bordi for a seminar. Why don't you come too?" And I thought, "Okay, I'll come." Apparently, other people had said, "Oh no, Mother, she's catching everywhere," and Mother said, "No, no, she'll be all right." I heard this later.

Douglas just kind of took me under his wing. On the train, he was the one that talked to me. I hadn't talked in English at all, so I really didn't know what was going on. I just knew that I felt nice and I felt good with these people. He gave me my first photo—he obviously had photos on him to be used whenever necessary—and was just such a comforting, normal person who took an interest. He just took an interest in people and helped those who needed help.

Later, when I came back to England, I went to stay with him. He must have invited me to stay overnight. I was really impressed because at that time, Mother told us all to get up and meditate at four in the morning. As you said, Pat, he was very good with gadgets, and he'd set up this amazing light-show alarm system that went off at four in the morning with bells and neon lights, so you couldn't possibly sleep through this 4 a.m. alarm.

He could see that I worried a lot and had a lot of left-side stuff. He said to me, "Do you believe in the power of God?" And I said, "Yes, of course, of course I do." He said, "Well, don't you think that God has all the power to correct any mistakes you might make?" Just the way he said it, it was just like, "Oh yes, that's it." It made such a huge difference to me and just changed something in my mind, so I could just go above all this.

A few years back, I had been trying to verify the date of a talk I was at in London with Shri Mataji. I felt the date on it was not correct, so I contacted him, and he replied to me through Skype from India. I was so amazed. Suddenly I got this call from Douglas coming from India. I'd always wanted to say thank you from my heart that he had taken care of this damaged person and helped me so much. His eyes sort of twinkled and he said, "Oh, I see. So I must have a special place in your heart then." And I thought, "Yes, that's absolutely true. Yes, you do, Douglas." It was very nice.

He helped you to come to see Mother, Krishna, didn't he? From Caxton Hall.

"Yes, of course. Now it's my turn. With his gadgets and tapes... I went to the first meeting with Shri Mataji, and when I went for the second time, Shri Mataji wasn't there, but Douglas was, putting on the tape to play. I really wanted to find out how to meet Shri Mataji, so I asked him if I could help with the tapes and equipment. He said okay. Then after a while, I asked him, 'By the way, could you give me the address of the ashram?' He looked at me and became quite suspicious, but he checked my Kundalini. He put his hands above my head and then he said, 'All right then.'

So the next Sunday, the same week, I went to the ashram and there was Sahasrara Puja. Shri Mataji asked me to wash her feet and to decorate her feet. Then she asked me to participate in the havan with the 1000 names with translations. By the end of the day—and then there was a music program in the evening—I was so cleared out. I was just walking on air when I left the ashram. And this was thanks to Douglas checking my Kundalini."

This was again in the fall of '79, I think. We got this message that we were all to go to Douglas's flat. I think the message was he was cooking us all dinner. So we were there, most of the small collective, in his flat. Suddenly the door opened and Shri Mataji arrived. And she arrived with a birthday cake. Douglas hadn't told anyone. It was a complete surprise to everyone. And he said, "Oh Mother, how did you know?" And she said, "Of course you're my son. I know these things." For me, I felt Mother had come especially to show people that Douglas was special, was important. Sometimes I felt this attitude that Douglas was a bit... you know, he wasn't intellectual, so people didn't always respect him very well. And yet Shri Mataji came and I just felt, now she's saying, "This is Douglas, my son. He is worthy of respect." It was very significant for me.

Greshner sent me this little bit from Mother's talk, which was very sweet. This is Mother's words: "Like we had one Douglas Fry with us. And I suddenly asked him, what about your birthday? He was taken aback. He didn't know—he's sitting here—he didn't know how I knew that his birthday was there. And he really had a rebirth from the life he had. And when I said, he said, 'How do you know, Mother?' I said, 'I know about your birthday.' And I went to his house and I saw him and I was so overjoyed to see him settle down. It is amazing how your seed grows and how fragrant you become."

I want to talk about seeing Douglas's halo. On that first seminar, I was very shy, and I just used to watch him. We were all sitting out on the lawn, and Mother had said that as yogis, we can actually stare straight at the sun. I knew I couldn't because I couldn't really cope with the sun in my face. So everyone started to look at the sun, but I was looking at everybody else. I looked over at the guy in the green suit, Douglas. And there was the sun... there was like a golden globe all around his head as he was watching the sun. It wasn't anything on my retina because I looked away, I looked here, I looked there, and there was a golden globe around Douglas's head.

In the end, I said to Bart, who was near me, "Bart, look, the guy in the green suit. There's a golden halo all around him." And Bart was saying, "I can't see anything." It was there for so long. All the time that Douglas was looking at the sun, there was this big golden globe. I was thinking, "Is that his halo? Or did Victoria come down to greet him?" About seven years later, he was sitting around the table at Hounslow, and I told Douglas what I'd seen. In his most sweet, humble way, he said, "Oh yeah, that would have been my ego. I was a lot in my ego in those days." Don't try to make me look special, you know. He was very, very lovely, Douglas.

My first time in Dollis Hill, I discovered that Douglas was the one you could get tapes from. I said, "Oh, can I have a tape for each chakra?" He was very quick and efficient. He gave me all the tapes, one for each chakra. What people don't realize is that even just to do the recordings, you have to maintain the equipment, clean the heads. People doing all that type of stuff used to be copying tapes with the high-speed copier and sending them all around the world. So he made sure of that. Also, people don't know that he made a list, which we can post out later, of all the tapes he made and copied. I've been trying to continue his legacy. Shri Mataji gave over 500 talks in England, and we have like a hundred missing of those early talks. Because Douglas named them all, we've got a good starting point.

When we went on one of the first tours I went on, Douglas bought lots of equipment to donate to the Indian Sahaja Yogis so that they could also carry on the same thing. He had that forward vision. This was in the early '80s, '82, '83, something like that. To have somebody with that foresight was just amazing.

I remember being in Exeter. We were waiting for Shri Mataji to appear on the TV. Some hot tea got spilled on Douglas, and he didn't react at all. Anyone else would be like, "Ah, what's going on?" He was just completely unfazed by anything. And nothing was ever too much trouble.

At the end, I can read the tribute from the family of Deepak, whose family looked after Douglas for the last four years. It's very much from the heart and very much like Douglas really. Okay, I'll start reading the tribute.

"Even before we were told that we had been chosen to take care of Mr. Douglas Fry and his wife, Diviani Fry, who are shifting to India from the UK, my wife had started getting an inner voice: 'Be prepared. A very big responsibility is coming to you.' I also had a dream in which Shri Ganesha came on a white horse and ordered me to do some work for him. I went to do the work without thinking, and when I came back, he had left a message of love for us.

When we got to know that Douglas and his wife wanted to come to India and stay with us, we felt tremendous vibrations. Even without knowing much about them, we sent a message that they were most welcome to come and stay with us for as long as they wished.

On the day of their arrival in India, on the 18th of January, 2018, I was in my office and my wife called me to tell me that Douglas Uncle and Diviani Auntie had just arrived at home. I immediately left my office. Throughout my journey back home, I had been getting tremendous vibrations. When I met them at the house, we felt as if all Ganas had arrived with them in the form of vibrations. Diviani Auntie brought a teddy with her from the UK to India, and when I asked her the teddy's name, she replied, 'This is my Deepak.' Of course, this man's name is also Deepak, which she didn't actually know.

Since that moment, by the grace of Shri Mataji, I felt a strong bonding in my soul with both of them. Through these divine vibrations, Shri Mataji had already made a connection between them and us, a connection that we have always felt since then.

Staying with them for more than four years, we really thank our Holy Mother forever that she chose us to look after them. Douglas Papa and Diviani Auntie are not only Sahaja Yogis, but we can say for sure that they are the Ganas of Shri Adi Shakti. They were sent here by Shri Mataji just for some work to be done as per her will. Through them, Shri Mataji taught us small things and helped us grow deeper and deeper in Sahaja Yoga meditation. For example, whenever we or anybody talked to them, they answered through vibrations only, and it always worked out. We saw their intense love for us and also the power of detachment. They always enjoy the company of Sahaja Yogis and like to give joy to everyone. They were always demonstrating by personal example that a Yogi should be like that.

I was amazed to find that through the divine attention and guidance of Shri Mataji, all the kind of official work relating to obtaining visas, etc., for Uncle and Auntie from the government departments were completed without any hassle. Shri Mataji had always been guiding me with proper directions.

It was teamwork. Since the year 2019 onwards, Shri Mataji involved Mona Baya from the UK, and together we have been working day and night to take care of Douglas and Diviani. The joint work has been going on amazingly. Without Shri Mataji's guidance and blessings of strength, patience, and of course, vibrations, it could not have been possible.

Interestingly, everything has been working out as per the wishes of Douglas Papa. We have been witnessing for more than four years that whatever he wished for, Shri Mataji has worked out perfectly. That shows that he was always in the attention of Shri Adi Shakti. Thanks to Shri Mataji again and again. Also thanks to our loving Douglas and Diviani for everything." This is from Deepak.

It's fantastic that they managed to end their days there, instead of in a home in London, separated. And what courage, what an adventurous nature of Douglas, to run away from England in a wheelchair to India to stay with somebody he didn't know. We English yogis are very grateful to all the yogis in Noida for giving love and care to Douglas and Diviani. It's just unbelievable what they have done for them.

It's actually kind of interesting because Douglas introduced me to snooker, watching snooker on the TV. We both enjoyed watching Ronnie O'Sullivan. He was explaining to me what had happened with Mother when McEnroe was doing Wimbledon. Mother told us to watch events that were watched by millions of people because we could send our vibrations back through the TV. So Douglas was carrying on this tradition with the snooker. The day before I heard that he'd passed, I just had a really strong desire to watch some snooker, like we used to. It was kind of like he was just sort of saying, "Bye-bye, and don't forget the snooker."

I took him to India with Barry. I was Diviani's assistant and Barry was Douglas's assistant. We only found one airline that would take them without a doctor's certificate because they were both so very poorly and frail. Steve managed to find somewhere that would take them without any kind of doctor's approval. We were all quite apprehensive about what would happen when we got to India. We made Steve promise not to tell the social services until we landed in India. Steve did, and they were very shocked. It's like we were in the bubble of vibrations and we were just watching it, but it was rather fun.

When we landed, we had two big jeeps. My Rakhi brother in Delhi, Yogesh, had already been down to Noida to meet Deepak and Paru. He rang up and he said, "Oh, vibrations were really good for this couple to look after Douglas and Diviani. They want to take them in; they're making room in their house." It just all felt so wonderful and so easy flowing that we just went. With all the dramas going on outside the bubble, it was really quite plain sailing. We were in Deepak's house within a couple of hours of landing.

One thing that always struck me about Douglas was that he never shied away from so-called danger. I think he came down to Brighton, and somebody had said to him, "Oh, you don't want to go up on that hill. That's where all the witches have their things." So of course, we got the Land Rover out, and everybody had to go up there, and we did a puja on top of this hill.

Another thing that happened was that Mother had said to us to go to all these other religious places and talk to the people because they are seeking, they're just not looking in the right place. He took us around to the Buddhist ashram and talked to them about Shri Mataji and how she had told us about Buddha. They were rather taken aback and they sort of said, "Thank you very much, and goodbye." But Douglas used to remember the little details. He said, "I'm just going to go and put a daffodil on Buddha's feet." And he did just that. He was very brave. He never let any negative thoughts in himself and never let them affect anything around at all.

Douglas always used to, when people were seriously ill, he would just go and work on them. He could go to hospitals because he felt that he had these vibrations and he has to share them. It was quite remarkable. I was always amazed by him because he was not afraid of anything. He was never not afraid of catching. He just wanted to give. As she said, "If you give with love, you will never get affected by anything."

I think we can just conclude for tonight. I'm really pleased that we have gathered together to remember Douglas. I think he would be overjoyed. He would like this. And he is overjoyed. He would have a good laugh.

I had an email from Sia in America about this, and she said she had been reading the lovely comments people made. But she said it would be nice if people said things like that when people are still alive. So it was an interesting thing. If we had all sent Douglas these messages before... I was very happy I had that. That's why I really wanted to talk to him. I am very conscious of that nowadays, and I really make an effort to say these things that are in my heart so that when people go... you... yeah.
