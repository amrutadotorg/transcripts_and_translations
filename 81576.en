 (England)
I came to Sahaja Yoga in November 1980. Before that, I was living in Sicily, Italy. I had been brought up as a Catholic, but I had thrown that away a long time before. Living in Italy brought me some kind of answer about myself. What was quite amazing throughout my life before Sahaja was that I was very lucky; I had a lot of luck. My father was not so lucky, and I thought, "Why am I so lucky?" There's something behind my head. To make it short, I came to the conclusion that there was some kind of special hand doing things for me without me asking. Things would just come to me. I was so lucky it was not normal. Gradually—I can't give all the details—I came to the conclusion that I had to go to London.

I felt something great was going to happen there. I didn't know what, but I felt I would meet something or someone that would give me a big answer to my questions. So I arrived very excited and got a teaching job. I wasn't supposed to get that teaching job because I had studied Italian. I wanted a French assistant job in England, but as a French person, you had to have a degree in English to be admitted in London, and I had an Italian degree. So I thought they wouldn't give it to me. But as a matter of fact, I got the job, and I was so shocked. I said, "I shouldn't have gotten that job."

I talked to one of my students in Italy. His name was Giovanni, and he was already a seeker. I was not seeking; actually, I didn't know I was a seeker. And I said, "Look at that, isn't it amazing? I shouldn't have had this job. I was not on the priority list, but I got it. I'm too lucky. This is even frightening." And he said, "You're not aware of it, but you deserve it." I said, "Why should I deserve it? I did nothing." He said, "Yes, but there are vibrations which circulate between people, and your desire can be heard at the other end of the planet." I thought, "Okay. From Palermo to London, it's a long way."

But since that day, I started thinking, "Maybe he's right." Gradually, I had the feeling I had to go to London to discover yoga, because he gave me a book to read called Twelve Lessons on the Philosophy of Yoga. It talked about Kundalini and the Spirit. That was my first book about yoga, and I thought, "Whoa, that makes sense." So I had the strong feeling that I was going to London to get an answer about that. I thought, okay, I got this job, but it's just a facade. In fact, I knew I was going there to find someone, and I thought it was going to be about yoga. And this yoga would have to give me some answers about the mystery of vibrations. But I didn't want to do Hatha Yoga, because it's too slow for me. I'm an Aries; I like things to be quick. I didn't want to be breathing slowly or making knots with my hair or my nose. No, no, no. I wanted something more.

I knew I was going to meet something and someone. Three weeks after I arrived in London, I said, "Okay, I have to find a yoga." But how could I find one? So I bought Time Out in Victoria Station. Actually, I will confess, I stole it. I stole it because I was not a thief as such, but in those days, we had these communist ideas in our heads. We felt we had to be against the rich people, and I was thinking, "I don't have enough money, so if I steal from a big company, it won't do them any harm." Of course, I wouldn't steal from my neighbor.

Later, they explained to me that stealing is bad for your left Nabhi. I said, "Okay, I want the answer. Why is it bad for the left Nabhi to steal?" So I stole another Time Out. That was after Realization. The same day I stole that Time Out, I left my bag on a big red double-decker bus. I never found the bag again. And I thought, "Okay, I understand now."

Anyway, to come back to meeting Shri Mataji. I saw a very, very tiny advert for Shri Mataji with that traditional photograph of her. A very small text said, "Before going back to India, Shri Mataji is giving Realization." I didn't know what Self-Realization was; I didn't know all this terminology. Then I saw "Free Entrance," and I thought, "Wow, this is for me! I have no money. Very good." So I went to see this lecture.

I remember it was on the 6th of November, 1980. It was in a place we never went to again, because after that, it was at Caxton Hall. When I got there, there were about 50 people, maybe, and they were all doing strange gestures. I thought, "What is this? Where am I?" Then Shri Mataji came and she gave a talk. I remember I drank all her words. I thought, "Wow, this is what I really feel. She's putting words to what I am living and what I am thinking." I can't remember if she spoke about vibrations that first evening, but at one stage when I was looking at her, it was as if she had a light within her face and she was radiating. I thought it was very strange because she wasn't white and she wasn't dark; it was just like light coming from her, but I could still see her face very clearly.

At one stage, she stood up, because as John was saying, she would come to see all the new people. When she stood up, I felt this big rush of energy coming up. I thought, "What was that?" But I didn't pay attention. Then she passed next to me. I had a little fringe, and she touched it and said, "Oh, she's sparkling." And I thought, "Wow, she doesn't know me. How kind. She's so kind." She said, "Oh, you are lucky," because she hadn't felt anything. Someone said to me, "Are you going to come back?" I said, "I don't think so," because I thought it was just a one-off lecture. He said that because of the rush of energy, I should come back.

I forgot to say that Douglas was there, and he worked on me with an Australian lady, I remember. They were doing things behind me, and I thought, "What are they doing?" Then I turned to Douglas and said, "You know what? I've come to London to meet a yoga. Do you know a good yoga for me?" He said, "Well, the yoga of Shri Mataji." And I said, "Oh, okay."

The second time I came back is when I really started feeling the vibrations. And Maureen was there. Well, that is it. That's the beginning.
