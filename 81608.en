Yes, it was like that. We didn't quite know what was going on on the subtle level, and it was often very, very intense. Sometimes Mother used to say what the deities were happy about and what they were not, and the Ganas as well. You didn't know from one moment to the next where the fun stopped and the serious things started, because they were just together. It was so intense on a very deep level. So it was fun, but it was hard.

When her aspect of the Goddess was fighting, the negativity would manifest. Because the negativity was also connected with us, inside us, it had to be fought. We had to witness it, really, because we couldn't do it. Mother had to do it, and the battle was in one room. It wasn't anywhere else.

She would often, as I was saying, completely spoil us, but there'd be the other extreme where we'd be completely blasted. The negativity would try to act through us because we were around Shri Mataji all the time. And seeing Shri Mataji in a furyâ€”I think that's the strongest I've ever felt the vibrations. The vibrations were so incredibly powerful. I've never felt vibrations like it when Shri Mataji has been angry. Even when she was angry with someone else, just being in the room was so powerful.

But she was actually giving her blessings, really, because she was just driving a thing out. Sometimes she'd have you on the run for days or weeks, and it would lead up to one almighty big blasting. But it was all her compassion, a compassion that I don't think we as human beings could ever understand.

On the subject of building, once we were at Brompton Square. It was virtually finished by then, in '83, looking absolutely beautiful, all golden and wonderful. We noticed there was just one wall that had not been wallpapered. So Antonio, another guy, and I had this idea: let's wallpaper this wall as a surprise for Mother. Mother said she was going to an international conference and would leave at about 3 o'clock. She said she would come back the next day in the early morning. That gave us plenty of hours.

We waited for Mother to go. She was looking beautiful, so beautifully dressed when she went to the conference. Mother knew what we were thinking; we were just waiting for her to leave so we could do the surprise. At last, Mother left with Sir C.P. Now we could decorate that wall. We started, and ten minutes later, Mother was back. Sir C.P. would often forget some important documentation; this was quite common. Mother caught us in the act.

"So, what are you up to?"

"Oh, well, we are decorating this wall."

"Oh, I see. Well, remember this: when you start something, it's not auspicious to leave it half done. So make sure you finish it. If you must, take plenty of coffee. Drink as much coffee as you want, but finish that. And there's one more thing. Sir C.P. does not like a gap in between the wallpaper. That looks very unprofessional. I'm sure you agree with that. When you put wallpaper up, you mustn't leave a gap. So, not because of me, but because of Sir C.P., make sure it looks professional."

"Of course, of course. Antonio is a professional; he's an artist. He would never leave a gap on the papers." No gaps, guaranteed.

We finished the whole job by about 5 a.m. We double-checked and double-checked: no gaps whatsoever. We went to sleep. At about 9 a.m., there's a ring on the bell. We were all exhausted. I went and answered the door. Shri Mataji was at the door, ringing the bell. She said, "I wasn't sure whether to ring or not in case you were resting, but I checked the vibrations. And on vibrations, I felt that one of you at least must be awake." Yes, Mother was right. I was awake.

So Mother came in. She didn't look very pleased; we could feel there was something wrong. She didn't say anything about the wallpapering, and she went to bed. She got up at about midday. We went to see her, and she was a bit gloomy. We said, "My goodness, Mother should be very pleased with this beautiful wallpapering we did." She's really gloomy and sad. So we said, "Mother, didn't you like the wallpapering?"

"Of course I did, very much."

"So what's the problem?"

"Well, there's a very big gap on the wall."

"That's not possible! We checked it three times. There's no gap whatsoever."

Mother said, "Yes, I'm sorry. There's a gap on the wallpaper."

"Impossible. We checked it. Absolutely not there."

"Shall I show you?" Mother stood up and went and showed us the gap. We looked at it. Oh my God, what a gap on the wallpaper! I think it's called shrinkage; it shrank during the night or something. Really, we could have died that moment, all of us. She said, "Don't worry about it. Let's fix it with vibrations. Just push it." We didn't have faith for that.

So Mother started pushing the wallpaper. We were looking at her and she said, "Don't you help me, please? Don't just stand there watching me push the paper. You push it, too." So we all started pushing the wallpaper from all directions. The paper didn't budge a millimeter. I said, "Mother, it's too late. It's totally dry now. There's nothing you can do. We'll strip it off and start again."

"No, no, no. You don't get the point. It's not you who pushes it; it's the vibrations that actually do it. Just push it. Have some faith."

We pushed a bit more with Mother. We felt sorry for her, pushing the paper, but nothing happened. We knew we'd have to strip the paper. So we had a big meal and big cups of tea and thought, "Well, let's do it." We arrived there to strip the whole thing off and start again. "Okay, where is the gap?" "Oh, it's here." "No, no, not there. There." "Where?" We started looking. We couldn't find the gap. The gap was gone while we had lunch and a cup of tea. The vibrations did it in the end, but not in front of our eyes.

It was quite chaotic in Chelsham Road, and to cut a long story short, I was literally running late. Shri Mataji was there with Pamela at the station. I just ran into the station, bought the ticket, ran to the train, and I could see Pamela and Shri Mataji in first class. I thought, "God, I should have gotten a first-class ticket." So I went in and said, "I'm just going to go and change my ticket, Shri Mataji."

She said, "Why?"

I said, "Well, I just didn't think, Shri Mataji, I bought a second-class ticket."

She said, "Pamela, go and change our tickets."

I said, "No, no, it's okay," and pleaded with her, but she wouldn't have it. She made Pamela go and change their tickets to second class. So Pamela arrived back, and I thought, "Oh my God, not only am I late, but Shri Mataji's changing her tickets to second class." Shri Mataji was in the lead, and the three of us walked from carriage to carriage, and it was completely packed. I thought, "Oh no," and started feeling really guilty. We went into the next carriage, and again, it was completely packed. I think it wasn't until the fourth carriage that we found one that was completely empty. Pamela sat down opposite Shri Mataji, and I sort of gingerly sat opposite her, still feeling quite bad about it all.

The train pulled away, and I felt something in my lap. It was Shri Mataji's foot. She said, "Rub my feet." I thought, "Wow." So I started to rub her feet. It was always different when you rubbed Shri Mataji's feet. Sometimes you felt quite hot or uncomfortable; other times you'd go into complete joy and bliss, and that was one of those times. I just went into this complete joy. The vibrations would go right into your center heart, you'd have a big whoosh of energy, and you'd just feel lots of love. The only way I can explain it is that I just wanted to go into her feet in those moments. I just wanted to hug her, kiss her, and it was like uncontrollable ecstasy, bliss, and joy.

That went on for three hours. All that guilt in my center heart just completely disappeared, and that particular weekend in Sheffield, Shri Mataji just completely spoiled me. She was always giving me her food.
