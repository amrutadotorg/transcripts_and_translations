Mother said on a number of occasions, "Someone unauthorized trying to raise a Kundalini will have you jumping like frogs." And everyone thinks it's just Mother saying something to get the point across that you shouldn't do this. But people were literally jumping like frogs. I won't name him, but someone who was really naughty would flick a vibrating walnut at them. He knows who he is.

They were really, really down. And as Maude said, Mother would put her foot on their neck and work on them. They were very, very poorly. But it was bizarre because they would roar and scream like banshees, and a second later, once the bhoot had let go for a while, they would be very polite, saying, "I'm very sorry about that. I don't know what came over me." And then it would start all over again, poor things. But we were all involved in working on these people.

Mother would work on them individually for so long. I remember her sitting in the chair just in front of the window for ages and ages. And sometimes she would have someone down there with her foot on their back. Absolutely.

Great. Thanks. That's incredible, isn't it? Amazing.

Dania, you were 13 years old when you first met Shri Mataji. Would you like to tell us about your experience at Brompton Square when you were still a student?
