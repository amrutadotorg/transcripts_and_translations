 (England)
I'd done a lot of seeking—pretty terrible things like theosophy and all these sorts of intellectual seeking—and had gotten completely lost and very damaged. I'd come back to London after being away for a few years. I was feeling very unhappy, very depressed, and quite unwell. I even took a day off work because I was feeling so depressed; I'd never done that before in my life.

I was sharing a house with two or three other people, and one of them said, "I've seen this advertisement in the newspaper, Time Out, for this Indian lady who's giving a talk at Caxton Hall." I said, "Well, I'm not going to anything like that. I've just been so damaged. No way." And she went.

That night when she came back, I noticed she looked different. There was a little bit of color in her face, and she just looked more alive. Still, I thought, "I'm not going."

She went again, and by then I was very unwell. I said, "Oh, would you buy me some fruit on your way back from work?" She said, "Okay, I'll do that, but I'm going to Caxton Hall, so I'll be back a bit later." I said that was fine.

She came in late in the evening and gave me some grapes. I ate one, and it was so alive, so sparkling; I began to feel better. It was tingling with life and vitality, and I just thought, "This is just what I need." I called to her, "Where did you get these grapes?" She said, "Well, I bought them in the market, but this Indian lady at Caxton Hall gave me a lemon, and I put it in the same bag as the grapes." Obviously, they were vibrated.

So, the next visit, I went with her. I objected, but she just said, "I know I have to take you to see this lady. You'd just better come." So I did.

In those days, she would work on us individually; she'd come down from the stage and see each person. When she came to me, my flatmate was also there and said, "Oh, could you help my friend? She has some problems." Shri Mataji looked straight into me and said, "Where is your father? Where is your mother?" I explained that my father had died some years before for various reasons. Then she worked on me, and I just felt the most amazing upward rush, followed by total silence and stillness.

I can only say that I felt the weight of the whole world had been lifted from my shoulders. I couldn't even speak until the next day. I had to go home in silence, filled with such inner excitement and this new state of awareness. A few days later, she invited me to her house and said to me, "You must write to your mother." I said, "I've written to my mother, but she didn't answer." She said, "Just write to your mother." So I did, and my mother answered by return of post. She said, "Come and see me." From there on, our relationship healed.
