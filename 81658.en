Jai Shri Mataji to everyone. Welcome to our today's session. This is the third session in the series that we are doing with Avdut Uncle to understand his experiences, the time that he spent with Mother, and his understanding of Sahaja Yoga.

In today's session, we will talk about his experiences after 2011, post the time when Mother left her physical body. We will talk about those experiences. Apart from that, we will understand what exactly meditation is and how you get into meditation. We will understand certain points. So, we will start the session from here. Mayank, if you can put Shri Mataji's photo.

Uncle, let's start with a small meditation session.

Thank you very much. Put both hands on the ground. Ask the Mother Earth to absorb all the blockages on our chakras. At the same time, thank her for her generosity, for her abundance. Abundantly, she has given us a lot of things: fruits, flowers, nature. And kindly, pray at her feet to absorb all which is disturbing us. Certainly, we can pray whatever we want, with the main intention and attention on the hands.

Thank you very much.

Now we can put the left hand on the left thigh and keep the right hand towards the Mother Earth. As Sahaja Yogis, we know what to pray. Just keep our attention on vibrations coming in from the left hand and going out from the right hand. It's just like when we start a car, we try to see the tire pressures.

Now we can put the right hand on the right thigh, left hand towards the sky. Again, we observe what's happening within us. A small prayer to Shri Mataji to allow us to evacuate everything on the right side: thinking, planning, tiredness.

Now we can put the left hand on the left thigh. Pray to Shri Mother Kundalini: please be kind enough. With whatever defects we have, we pray at your lotus feet. We pray to you to rise and take us into the fourth dimension. Let us remain in the fourth dimension.

With all the devotion, with all the bhakti, we'll raise the Kundalini with our right hand. Pray very, very slowly. Then we put a bandhan, slightly on the Vishuddhi, two or three bandhans. And Agnya, some bandhans. Then on the Sahasrara. And we take it out, as if you are taking out some things from our Sahasrara. Let them go away.

So we do it two more times. Very slowly, raise our Kundalini. On our Vishuddhi, we put some bandhans. The thoughts rise from Vishuddhi—super ego, ego. Then we put some bandhans on the Agnya Chakra. We put some bandhans on Sahasrara. Full devotion. Try to take out everything which is blocking our central channel. Leave it above our head.

Do it the third time, the same thing. And put the palm of our right hand on the Sahasrara. Bend our head slightly in the front. Move the scalp in the clockwise direction. Mother, please establish the state of Nirvikalpa.

You can raise our hand. Try to feel the cool breeze coming out of the Sahasrara. Take down our hand. We try to keep our attention on Sahasrara where we had our hand just now. Remain in this state for some time, fully remembering who Shri Mataji is and who we are.

Now to end this small meditation, just say once the third mantra of Sahasrara. Now we can slowly open the eyes. Get the kumkum of Shri Mataji. Feel the thoughtlessness on our Agnya, the vibrations on the Sahasrara. No thoughts. Just being in the present. Thank you, Shri Mataji. We can start the session.

Thank you so much, Uncle. This was a very nice session. We will start today's session, Uncle. So, we have been doing sessions wherein we are sharing your experiences with Mother while she was there in physical form. Today, I wanted to talk to you about your experiences once Mother had left her physical body. What exactly did you feel? And what exactly were your observations? How were the vibrations like after that? If you can just take us through a little bit on that. And then if I have questions, I will keep asking in between.

Yes. Now, before we go into this post-2011 era, there are two or three things which escaped my attention last time, which I will just quickly tell. In the 1973 Navratri, we had a nine-day puja on the terrace of Shri Mataji's house building. It was called Jivanjot. And to answer a question, Shri Mataji once said that for even a leaf on the earth to move, the order has to come from here. And she pointed at her Kundalini. So this is something which I wanted to share with you.

Secondly, there was a birthday puja and a yogi went to offer Shri Mataji a present. And Shri Mataji said, "No, no, I will not take it." Suddenly, the yogi closed his eyes. And within a few seconds, Shri Mataji said, "Okay, I will take the present." And she took the present. Then I asked the yogi, "What did you say, if you can share it with me?" And he said, "Shri Mataji, let my desire be so pure that you accept my small little present." And as he just said that in his heart, Shri Mataji immediately accepted the present. So whatever is our pure desire, our pure intentions, Shri Mataji accepts. She does that.

And last time we had seen another incident where Shri Mataji was talking about this vortex. When people are very close to one person and when that person goes out, what happens? The others also go down in that vortex. In that respect, I would like to narrate another thing about one Mr. 'But'—obviously, the name is different. When he came to Sahaja Yoga, he was a chain smoker of Charminar. Indians must be knowing it's a very, very strong cigarette. And he just left smoking within a day. He was so happy and everything was in such... Then there was another Sahaja Yogi who had come to Sahaja Yoga and he did some things which were not correct. He was put out of Sahaja Yoga. Now this fellow who had been put out of Sahaja Yoga had brought this Mr. But into Sahaja Yoga. So this Mr. But had a little bit of a soft corner for him.

And then once, while coming from the office, he said, "Let me go and meet this yogi who has gone out of Sahaja Yoga." When he went in, he talked, and when he came out, he said, "Let me just see if I can smoke again." And he smoked once. He started liking it, and he smoked more and more. When Shri Mataji used to come, this Mr. But was very close to us, so he told me, "Please ask Shri Mataji to work on my Vishuddhi so that I will be cleaned." So I used to tell Shri Mataji, and Shri Mataji used to clean him. And then he stopped smoking. This happened for two years. When Shri Mataji would go back, he would again start smoking. Then the frequency increased.

The third year, I told Shri Mataji, "He has again started smoking. He has asked me to convey this to you." Then Shri Mataji worked on him for one to one and a half hours. I still remember it was in Nilambar. This fellow was sitting at the feet of Shri Mataji, with his back towards her, and Shri Mataji was working on his Vishuddhi. And when she worked on anybody's chakras, she used to say, "Aham Shri Krishna. Aham Shri Krishna." I don't know the exact wording, but "Aham Shri Krishna." And she used to put this Sudarshan Chakra on his Vishuddhi several times and massaged it and really worked very hard on him. And then he was cleansed forever. He did not get this feeling to go and smoke again.

Then I went to him and I said, "What happened to you? Why do you smoke? What was the feeling?" He said, "I feel some sort of a catch in my Vishuddhi and it's strangling me. So when I smoke, I feel good that time." This incident is just to tell you what Shri Mataji has said in "How to Meditate," 1976, Mumbai. People who are out of Sahaja Yoga, do not have any connection with them. I leave it to you to go through this talk. This is a very, very good talk. There are some talks later on I can tell you which are really very, very good, like this one. Then there is "The Necessity of Meditation," 1975, Mumbai. Then there is one for Shri Ganesha also, a Hindi talk, 1988, Ganesh Puja, Mumbai. Later on, we can talk about it. So in that, Shri Mataji says that. I leave it to you, go through the talk. It's in Hindi and the translation is available.

So coming to your question, Dushyant, about after 2011.

"Not a leaf moves without my permission." So I just wanted to understand, Uncle, we as youngsters, we work, we go to school, colleges, offices. So out there, we feel as if we are doing it. So what is the correct emotion? How should we interpret this? As yogis, what should be our disposition towards our daily routine, our daily work? What should be the thought process, or how should we integrate Mother's thought process with our daily lives? What would be your advice on that?

I wouldn't give any advice. I can just share my experience. I've gone through all those things you are talking about in our daily life, things not happening in the right way. So when you meditate deeply, we are feeling that Sahasrara, and we feel the vibrations on the Sahasrara. In one of the talks, they asked Shri Mataji, "How can we feel the vibrations when we keep the attention on Sahasrara all the time?" And Shri Mataji replied, "We have to just keep our attention... chitta. Where is our attention going?"

So if we are able to do that in our day-to-day life, like at this moment, at this present moment, where is my attention? My attention is everywhere, but it is fixed here, the Sahasrara. Shri Mataji gives that example of the boy flying the kite, or the lady carrying water on her head. All those things, we can put into practice. Because what happens is, if you have a really good meditation, that meditation stays for quite some time. It's like a fan; when you put off the current, it still goes on moving. So in those situations, we can always see, "Now, where is my attention? This fellow is making me angry. Now, where is my attention?" This is called abhyas in Marathi. It's a study of your attention.

And slowly and gradually, you can really be detached from what you are doing and from others. They will also feel that you are something different. First, they will feel that it is different. Then they will know that you are having something which they do not have. They might oppose you. They might even make fun of you.

I'll tell you one example. France is, from a Mooladhara point of view, a very, very bad place. They used to make all sorts of dirty jokes, not only that but even in the company where I was working. And I was just laughing; I mean, I couldn't make a face, but they knew that I did not sort of like it. And once, our technical director, we were out for lunch, and he said, "If there is one person in this company—we are not many, we are 15—who is a saint, it's Avdut." I said, "Why?" I asked, "Did you drink too much last night? Or did you just drink and come and you don't remember?" He said, "No, no, I'm very serious." And this was a fellow who used to crack all sorts of dirty jokes on everything, right from persons to gods and everything. You name it, and he has got a dirty joke on that. But he felt that there is something different. The main thing is, we should not get involved. And that happens when you are in that meditative state. You do everything, but your attention can be on the Sahasrara. This is again a study, it's an abhyas. I don't know if I replied to your question, Dushyant.

Yes, yes, Uncle, I got the gist of it. Thank you so much. This is just an experience I'm sharing.

Sure, sure, Uncle. Moving ahead, I was just wondering if you can talk a little bit about your experiences on the vibratory front, on certain problems, certain experiences post-2011, after Mother left her physical body. Any experiences that you would like to share?

Yes. With the awakening of the Kundalini, Shri Mataji has awakened in us what we can call detection instruments. I've always given it an image: detection instruments. Like we have fire detectors, we have thief detectors, all those detectors are there. So, these three detectors are within us. First is the Kundalini. Second are the vibrations. And third is the Sahasrara. Out of these three, the Sahasrara is the best. We'll see later on, but if you are feeling the vibrations on the Sahasrara, you can be sure that things will move in the right direction.

Now, for these experiences after 2011, when Shri Mataji told us Sahaja Yogis that we should be together... we are some Sahaja Yogis who share our experiences. Some of them I can share with you. One of these Sahaja Yogis, his son wanted to get admission into his second year of a master's program. He had done the first year, and for the second year, he had applied but was waiting. He sent all his papers with the documents, but he was not called. It was on a Monday, and he came and told his parents, "Today they are calling others for the interview, and I was not called." The parents said, "Okay, at least go tomorrow with the documents," because he had very good results in the last semester. He had good marks. He could not sleep, and the parents did not sleep either.

In the morning when this fellow went, the father was very, very much disturbed, which is rather obvious because he thought that if he is not getting admission, his whole career will be spoiled. So, he just went in front of Shri Mataji. He told me later on, he said, "I did not put a bandhan. I did not pray to Shri Mataji. I did not ask anything of Shri Mataji. I just went in front of the photo and put my hands like this." And he said, "I just felt very strong vibrations coming from the photo, like a whirlwind, a hurricane. It came and it settled on my Sahasrara like a crown, a cold crown." He went into meditation for quite some time, and he realized that if he feels the vibrations on the Sahasrara, there will be no problem. And in a few hours, he got an SMS from his son saying that he had been allowed to go inside for the interview. The interview went on quite well, and he finally got the admission. It is just to tell you that when we are feeling anything on the Sahasrara, we can be 100% sure that things will move in the right direction.

A second example was another fellow, a Sahaja Yogi. His son was very, very good. He had a good degree, like from IIT in India, and he was working in a bank, and then he lost his job. He was searching for something that matched his qualifications. For one year, he did not get anything. Then one day, his son was saying, "Worst comes to worst, I will come home," and all that. The father felt a bit worried about what was happening. And when he was just inside, he immediately felt the Sahasrara, vibrations on the Sahasrara. He said, "Ah, now it's good. I don't have to worry." This gave him the confirmation that things will be going in the right direction. Within about 15 days, he got a very good job at another bank, and everything went on very well. This happened several times. So, when you are feeling vibrations on the Sahasrara, it's a 100% definite guarantee.

We can also awaken our Kundalini with our attention. This again requires some abhyas. Many people must have felt the Kundalini coming up when we do mantras or when we are in meditation. But this, we can even do at all times. Shri Mataji has shown this in different public programs. If you see, at the end of public programs, at least in the West, she always does this. She raises her Kundalini. And as she has also told, she takes all of us in her Kundalini and raises us above. If we are able, by some practice, to do that, we can do it in any circumstance.

One of our friends in this group was put out of his job. The company was about to close, and they said, "Now in 15 days, we'll be out of a job." He had known that he could raise his Kundalini. He went to his desk and just closed his eyes, put his hand on the desk, and he raised his Kundalini several times, several times. And suddenly all those depressive thoughts about how he would get a job, everything went. When he came out of his office, the other fellow said, "You don't look very unhappy. Did you understand what's going to happen?" He said, "Yes, yes. In 15 days, we won't have a job." He said, "But how is it that you are not feeling any unhappiness? You don't look unhappy." So, this is what happens if you are able to raise the Kundalini with your attention.

Another thing was, these are real experiences which have been felt by Sahaja Yogis. He had to go for some public program where he had to talk. And he had a very, very hard day; very, very insulting things happened to him. He was quite depressed. He said, "Okay, now I have to go and talk to people. If I am like this in front of them, people will not understand." He did not even have time to go home or foot soak or do anything. So, he was in the metro train, fully packed. He said, "Okay, now let me just raise my Kundalini." And he raised it again and again and again and again with his attention, with his eyes open. So, once he went there, all his fatigue, everything went away. He spoke very well and people were so happy. The newcomers were very enamored, and this fellow who was feeling just some hours before what will happen...

So, these are the things we can do with awakening the Kundalini with attention. And now, this question you are talking about, Dushyant, what we can do in our day-to-day life. Another thing which we can do is to put a bandhan. All of us know that we put a bandhan. We can put a bandhan on the hand, but when we put this bandhan, we should try to do it in a way that we get proof of what's going to happen. It's like sending a letter by recorded delivery. I'm giving some images, "recorded delivery." So, when you put a bandhan, how do you feel inside?

I remember a very, very strong case when I was with Shri Mataji in Nilambar in '78. There was Mr. N.P. Godrej, who was my father's big boss. He was stabbed something like 16 times in his stomach. And his photo was there on the main page of the Times of India. When Shri Mataji saw it, she put a bandhan, just put a bandhan like this. Her bandhan is very, very different than ours. And in some days, Mr. Godrej recovered. They were quite surprised how it happened. But Shri Mataji had put a bandhan.

Another thing is, we should not put it mechanically, like some people do while talking to others. No. For example, when I have to put a bandhan for anybody, I go in front of Shri Mataji. If there's no light, I put on a light. "Shri Mataji, this Mr. So-and-so is having some problem. Can you please look after it?" We don't put any condition again. You should tell Shri Mataji, "He's in distress. He has got some problems, and I'm putting these problems at your lotus feet. If you think it correct, you can solve it." And when you put a bandhan very slowly, sometimes you can feel the vibrations on the Sahasrara. It's like a watch; you move the small ring, and the clocks move. The same way you can feel. When you put a bandhan, sometimes you can immediately feel the Kundalini coming up. That's it. No problem. You feel it on the Sahasrara, that's the best. If you feel the vibrations on the Sahasrara, things can never go wrong.

Sometime before, one of us had an email from some lady. She said, "My father is in the hospital, aged. Can you put a bandhan for him?" He just said, "Oh, don't worry, I'll put a bandhan, everything will be alright." But when he put a bandhan, no vibrations. He put it again and again, no vibrations. So, he immediately told her, "Just put it on Shri Mataji's feet, be detached. She knows what's best for your father." And in about an hour, he expired. But then this yogi put a bandhan for her, so that she would get over the shock.

And avoid as far as possible putting bandhan for your own personal use, unless, of course, it's very, very disturbing and very much serious. Then just tell Shri Mataji, and you can feel the reply in your hands without putting a bandhan. Because a bandhan is something which is very holy. As Shri Mataji said, these are very primordial movements. And we should not use them for small things, especially not very personal things. She knows what is troubling. So, we can put a bandhan for collective things, yes. For other people, yes. But not every time putting a bandhan. And once you put your bandhan, try to forget about it. Put a nice bandhan and then leave it to Shri Mataji.

In the Mahakali Puja in '82 in Lonavala, Shri Mataji said, "If it's not in your attention, it is in my attention. If it deserves my attention, I will definitely look after it." This is an assurance, not a guarantee. These are almost the same words. So, this is about putting a bandhan.

Uncle, can you show how to put a bandhan properly once?

No, no, you see, as Shri Mataji has shown it in the Christmas Puja '84 in the UK. She shows, just put a bandhan like this. Just put a bandhan like this. Okay? Our bandhan is the same. It's your attitude, your detachment. Very recently, a very good friend of ours, not a Sahaja Yogi, but she had her realization, was in the ICU. They said, "Okay, we'll put a bandhan." No vibrations. Then I told Shri Mataji, "Please, let me be detached from this problem." When I was putting it, slowly and gradually, the vibrations started coming in. The Kundalini rose and then settled on the Sahasrara. Then I wrote to them, "It's all right. It'll be all right." And in maybe a week or something, she was out of the ICU. Tomorrow she's going home. So, this can happen. There is no hard and fast rule. It's more what you feel inside, what your feelings are. That detachment should be there. Did I answer your question?

Yes, yes, uncle. Thank you so much. There is no hard and fast rule.

Correct. Uncle, you were talking about feeling inside and feeling from your Sahasrara what kind of vibrations you are getting. Any experience that you would like to share where the Kundalini actually gives you an indication of what is happening or how things are going to pan out?

If I start speaking, maybe we will pass the whole night like this. But it doesn't matter. I'll give you a couple of experiences from our group. One fellow was meditating, and at that time there was a Sahaja Yogi, a leader of that country. This yogi was meditating, but he was always thinking something about this leader, not in good terms. For half an hour, 35 minutes, maybe 40 minutes, he said, "I have no vibrations. I cannot be thoughtless." Then as they say, he decided to close the shop, just put a bandhan and get up.

And then he just had a thought: "If this fellow comes now knocking on the door, what will be your reaction?" As soon as he had this thought, he said, "Oh, I will open the door and I'll hug him as a brother." And as soon as he thought of this, at the same time, the Kundalini shot up like anything. He had vibrations on the Sahasrara and on his hands. When he looked at Shri Mataji's photo, it was as if Shri Mataji was telling him, "You see, love is the only way." Shri Mataji has told in many talks of love. I remember Sahasrara Day 2002, she said, "Love is the most powerful thing, most powerful thing."

A second experience is one of the Sahaja Yogis wanted to go to a seminar and he had to give a little talk on some subject. It was a three-hour drive and he had vertigo problems. The Yogis said, "No, we'll put a bandhan," and all. It was less, but still there. And he said, "Okay, at least my wife can drive." But then at the last minute, his wife had a very strong throat infection and she could not come. But he told me that every time he thought of the seminar, his Kundalini rose up. He thought, "I have to talk," and the Kundalini rose up. He was very confident from inside and very calm, peaceful from inside, that things will go in the right direction. And it did. It was very, very good. Shri Mataji did it, I must say. Because what happens is when the Kundalini rises and settles in the Sahasrara, we are sort of taken care of by the vibrations. And when that happens, we feel that whatever is happening to me, it's Shri Mataji who wants it to happen.

Even if it feels bad, I'll give you a small example, quickly. One Sahaja Yogi was having a rather serious lung infection. And he called Shri Mataji. She said, "Don't worry, I will send some kerosene from Australia." Yeah. And she said, "But you take care of everything. Do what is necessary." Then it went off rather quickly, quicker than normal. And Shri Mataji told him, "Because your father was very strict during your young age, and that was pressing on your heart. Because of this, it has gone out." So what I'm trying to say is even if something bad happens, there is always something good. Because in October '85, Shri Mataji said that your life is chiseled. All the Sahaja Yogis, their life is chiseled. So whatever happens to me is because Shri Mataji wants it to happen. And whatever she wants to happen for me is for my spiritual good, not for my money or other things. No, spiritual good.

Once that is there, we feel completely detached. We are in a witness state. We say, "Okay, let's see what's happening. Let's see what's happening." We are like in a cinema drama going on in our real life, because we know that it's Shri Mataji who is doing it. I'm not doing anything. And once that happens, we feel peaceful. We are not worried. We are not perturbed. Shri Mataji talks about it in a Sahasrara talk in 1999. We feel peaceful. This is something which we can feel in our Sahasrara when the Kundalini comes up.

Uncle, we spoke about a lot of things: the Kundalini giving indications, putting a bandhan, awakening Kundalini with attention. Would you like to discuss certain things that Sahaja Yogis should always take care of while going out or while meeting with someone or going to work?

Yes, again in this talk, "How to Meditate," '76 Mumbai, Shri Mataji has told a lot, a lot of things. One of them was, before we go out, we should put a bandhan. And Dushyant, your brother Aninya Shiv told that when you put this bandhan, you should take out your shoes. I remember that. So, when we put a bandhan, we put it very slowly. During COVID, I also put a double bandhan. You put a bandhan like this, seven times, raise the Kundalini, and again put a bandhan. When you do it slowly, you can even sometimes feel the Sahasrara.

When you are putting this bandhan, try to feel it on your hands. The left hand is free, you can feel it also on the Sahasrara. Yesterday, I had something very important when going out, and I put a bandhan and I felt it on the Sahasrara. I just went in front of Shri Mataji and I immediately felt the vibration of the Sahasrara. So, if you are feeling this on the Sahasrara, things will move in the right direction.

Now, many people put a bandhan like this, like a wiper or if there are lots of mosquitoes you are taking them out. No. You have to put it very, very slowly. And if you are doing that, many times it happened to many of us that you will suddenly remember something which you have forgotten. "I don't know, car keys or this document I have not taken." Very slowly.

Secondly, which I would like to share, which happened with us, is that after putting a bandhan, just put your hands like this. If the vibrations are correct in both hands, fantastic. But sometimes you can feel some catches. I would not like to go into all the catches, but especially if you are having a right Agnya catch, you can be quite sure that there will be some Agnya problems at work. Also, for example, if you feel a left Nabhi catch, you can be sure that it is going to be a quite hectic day. And sometimes you feel a lot of vibrations, means your boss is going to give you a promotion! So this, putting a bandhan while going out, we can really, literally know how the day is going to be.

There are also some other things which I would like to just share quickly. If we are putting a little bit of camphor and also ajwain, that helps a lot for improving the vibrations. Also, putting ice on the liver, we know all this. Also, when you are doing the meditation, see that your head does not fall down. If you are feeling sleepy, it's better to wash your face. These are very small things, but sometimes people can miss it. I remember an aged Sahaja Yogi, he was with me and his head had fallen down. After the meditation, he said, "Such a lovely meditation." I said, "Excuse me, but your head had fallen down." So it was a little bit sleepy, maybe. And during the meditation, we don't do a lot of movements.

Regularly, try to clean the photo with rose water and wipe the photos. I still remember once, this locket, I had it on my finger and I used to feel the Agnya Chakra. So I went to Shri Mataji and I said, "I feel the Agnya Chakra." She said, "What is this ring?" I said, "Shri Mataji, it's your ring." She told him, "You put it here, but do you worship it every day? Do you put kumkum? Do you wipe it? Or are you just putting it for show, for decoration?" So if you are not able to do that, it's better not to put it. Recently, we had a seminar in Cabella called "Nirmal Dhyana." It's an e-booklet. I can give you the link later on. In that, there are a lot of talks from Shri Mataji where she also talks about the lockets and the photos which you put.

Moving ahead, you spoke about your past experiences, we have spoken about your current experiences. So now, uncle, I just wanted to understand how exactly should we interpret meditation? How to understand meditation?

I do not know if I told you last time or even before. Adi Shakti came on the earth to uplift human beings, to give them a higher status. And this incarnation, which physically had come, is very difficult to realize. Those beautiful moments which we spent with her, I would use the word realize. We should realize Shri Mataji. The only way we can realize Shri Mataji is through our bhakti, our devotion, and our complete surrender. Shri Mataji had told us time and again, "Be careful, I am Mahamaya." She had given us the rules of the game, but still, many of us slipped out, unfortunately.

Now, why should you meditate? Because in the meditative state itself, we can feel her presence. Not by reading or by doing anything else. So, why you should meditate, how you should meditate, what are the effects, what happens inside physically, and then what are the after-effects of meditation? Just very quickly, with Shri Mataji's permission, I am sharing some points of view, which I do not want to impose on anybody, just sharing them. Next time, the fourth session will be more only on meditation. And we will first see, why should we meditate? What is the reason to meditate?

About how to meditate... basically, in Sahaja Yoga, there is no hard and fast rule. The main thing, as I told you just now, is our whole attire, our whole feeling in this meditation. And when we are doing this meditation, there are some aspects, some parameters, we can say, which we have to take into account before we meditate. So, there is no hard and fast rule. But when we meditate, we say the prayers, we say the mantras, we sing the bhajans. Let me just tell you some definitions which Shri Mataji has given which are very important. It really marked me very much.

First is bhakti, devotion. On the 30th of March, 1990, Shri Mataji gave a very good talk, "Tin Yuktya," meaning three tricks to progress in Sahaja Yoga. It is in Delhi, a public program after the birthday puja celebrations. And Shri Mataji gives a definition of what is ananya bhakti. As you all know, ananya is "not the other," no duality. That we are one with her. We are one with her cosmic body. Then she says that when you are in ananya bhakti, you should see what I see, you should work as I work. And then she says that you should love others as you love me. That's ananya bhakti. I think this is the only time when she has talked of ananya bhakti.

Another aspect is a broad definition of bhakti. It's prayers, singing, bhajans. But we can go ahead with this in our day-to-day life, in our attire, in our behavior. We always have to remember that I am the son, I am the daughter of Adi Shakti. And how should I behave? How should I behave in such a way that my mother will not be unhappy with me? She will not be displeased with me. I have to keep her pleased. Somebody once said jokingly, "You keep Mother pleased and she will keep you pleased." You keep her pleased in all your day-to-day activities.

Have you ever experienced this, uncle? You please mother and mother took care of you?

Yes, very much. I don't know how to start and where to end. But really, I am telling you all those things from my own experience.

Now, about mantras. It's September 1983, Vienna. I quote Shri Mataji. She says, "Mantra, it is that power of the word that expresses the spirit. A mantra is nothing but a thought which is vibrated." For the definition of prayers, she has given it in Navratri Puja '89 in the UK. And she says, "It is not how many words you use for a prayer, but it is how deeply you have touched the feet of the divine that is important."

And also, she gives us the importance of dharma. December '79, Mumbai. She says, "It is not how many times you meditate, how many times you sit in water, use my photograph, or what you do, all these rituals. It is not that. It is how much dharma is within your heart." It's a very big thing which we have to really understand. We know what dharma is in Sahaja Yoga. We are members of Vishwa Nirmala Dharma. So, that purity and that holiness, that saintliness, should be imbibed in our day-to-day life.

You just mentioned that holiness should be imbibed into our daily life. How does this happen? During day-to-day life, it so happens that we get engrossed in so many things. So, how do you maintain that holiness all across the day?

There is a birthday puja program, it's in Hindi. I don't know why it is always in Delhi, but on 29th March 1986, Shri Mataji gives a very, very beautiful talk in Hindi. The translation is available. In that, Shri Mataji gives a lot of hints, a lot of things which help us to understand what she wants us to be. Shri Mataji says, "Tomorrow, such people will be in Sahaja Yoga who have kindness, forgiveness and peacefulness."

Also, she gives a very important indication of the importance of thoughtlessness. I would like to quote her. She says, "Entertainment is not forbidden in Sahaja Yoga. But the entertainment should be such that it establishes thoughtless awareness. Lectures should be such that they establish thoughtless awareness in you. Mantras should be recited in a way so that thoughtless awareness establishes within you."

And in another talk, Shri Mataji says you have to learn to love yourself. 16th February 1986, New Delhi again. Hindi. She says, "You are not only in my heart, but you are the blood cells flowing in my veins. You should always remember, I am moving in the entire body. So, how should I be so that my mother is not troubled?" And she says that if I do not have any problems, then the problems of the entire universe also go away. Such a big thing.

And then she says, but we should not only believe that we touched mother's feet, we gave her offerings. "We gave offerings to Mother. We gave flowers to Mother." No. "You should become the garland around my neck. You become my garland. Then I will accept that you believe in me." It's so much. I leave you to listen to it or go through the translation. It really moved me so much that any thought, anything that happens with me, Shri Mataji is aware of it. Even before I know what's going to happen, she knows why it's happening and she knows what's going to happen later on. If she is the Adi Shakti, she can do anything, everything. Our only thing is we have to try to become good instruments.

I think we should end here. We should do a small meditation session and end here and then continue in the next session, uncle. So the next session will be fully focused on the questions pertaining to meditation.

Okay. I think the best way for us is to just put our attention on the Sahasrara, and we'll feel her presence.

Shri Mataji, with your infinite love, you have come on this earth. You have chosen me as your child. With all my drawbacks and all my limitations, I just humbly surrender myself to your lotus feet. And I earnestly ask you to allow me to be in your company forever and ever, so that I am continuously nourished by you through my Sahasrara.

So we can just keep in silent meditation for some time.

Thank you, Shri Mataji.

Can we sing the three Maha Mantras, please?

Jai Shri Mataji. It was a wonderful session, Uncle, today. Lots and lots of vibrations. And it was great listening to your experiences and anecdotes that you shared on various things.

To everyone who is listening today, this is a series of sessions which is going on. We have done two sessions before this, session one and two. Links for the same are available in the description in case you would like to listen to them. We will have another session, the fourth session. That particular session will primarily focus on what meditation is, how one should do meditation, what are the key things that as a yogi we should take care of, and what exactly is expected out of us. We would be circulating the link for the same shortly.

Uncle, with this, we would like to end today's session. We would like to thank Mother for making this session possible. We want to thank you for being a part of this. So with this, Uncle, we will end today's session. Jai Shri Mataji, Uncle. Thank you so much.

Jai Shri Mataji. We can end the session today. Jai Shri Mataji.
