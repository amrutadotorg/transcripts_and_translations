Jai Shri Mataji. Jai Shri Mataji to all our viewers.

To everyone who is joining us for the first time, this is the fourth session in a series we're doing with Avdhoot Uncle. We are essentially covering his experiences of the time that he has spent with Mother, what he has felt, what exactly is the interpretation of those experiences, and how can we connect in a better manner with Mother and become better yogis. That has been the whole point of creating this series of videos.

If you have not watched the other three sessions, you can go into the description of this particular video, and you'll find the links to those videos as well. In today's session, we'll be talking about the importance and the understanding of how to go deeper in meditation.

So with Mother's permission and blessings, I would like to start this session. We would like to start off with a small, silent meditation. We will just slowly raise the Kundalini and put ourselves in bandhan.

(Put your right hand on the heart.)

Mother, please come in my heart. Let my heart be so clean that I can see your feet in my heart. Let me see your feet in my heart. Let me worship your feet in my heart. Let me always worship your feet in my heart. Mother, please come in my heart.

(Take down the hand and put your attention on the Sahasrara.)

Let me just be a beautiful instrument in your hands, Mother. Let my surrender be total. Let me go above the shackles of ego and superego. If necessary, you can just massage your Sahasrara with your hand. The attention remains there. Just for some time, let's feel Mother's silent presence in our Sahasrara.

We can finish the meditation with the third of the three Maha Mantras. Jai Shri Mataji.

After that session, full of vibrations, we'd like to move on to the next phase. So, we've spoken about your experiences with Mother and the time you spent with her. I'm sure in your experience with Sahaja Yoga, you would have encountered multiple levels of meditation as well, Uncle. We just wanted to translate your experience for the people who are listening.

To move forward from here, Uncle, I just wanted to ask a very simple question: What is meditation? What is it all about? And if somebody wants to go deeper into meditation, what would be your advice? What would be the direction from your side, based on what you would have learned from Mother and other yogis?

Last time we had talked about the question of how to meditate. We had said that there is no method in Sahaja Yoga; you cannot say you do A, B, C, D, and you reach the Sahasrara. It's not like this. But there are some parameters you have to take into consideration. Those parameters are to be imbibed in our personal lives whenever possible.

An important parameter is that of Shri Ganesha. Shri Mataji, as we know, has created us. She has given us birth exactly as Shri Ganesha, without the father. He knows only his mother; he does not know anybody else. If anybody wants to go deep into this Ganesha principle, there are three talks which really impressed me. Of course, all the talks on Shri Ganesha are very, very good, but these three particularly I heard quite a number of times. First is the "Mooladhara and Mahamaya" from April '85 in Birmingham. Then, the fourth of August '85 in Brighton. And the third is the Shri Ganesha Puja from September 1986 in San Diego, USA. There is also, for those who can understand Hindi, a beautiful talk from the 1988 Mumbai Shri Ganesh Puja. The talk is in Hindi, but the translation is available on Amruta.

If you are able to somehow get the blessings of Shri Ganesha, it's much easier. I always feel that we are surrendered to Shri Mataji, but still, we do not really know her or how she works. Shri Ganesha knows her very well, and if you surrender to him, he can take you to our dear Mother. Shri Mataji says just catch hold of his two little feet, and he will take you to a very high level of spirituality. Shri Ganesha is always in Nirvikalpa, as Shri Mataji talks about in Shere, 1991. So he's the one who can take us to Nirvikalpa. And one more thing Shri Mataji has mentioned is, unless and until our Ganesha principle is settled, our realization has no meaning.

So this is the very first deity, the first chakra, whom we have to really try to nourish. He is present on all the chakras. He acts as a Vice-Chancellor—again, this is from the Shri Ganesh Puja in San Diego, a very, very good talk—to pass through every chakra. He also reminds us in all circumstances. Whenever we hear the talks of Shri Mataji—I am sure everybody hears them—we meditate, we hear the talk, and then we forget about it. No. Shri Ganesha is the one who reminds us in every situation. There are lots and lots of talks of Shri Mataji.

In 1996, Shri Mataji says that you ask your questions: "What will happen to my family? What will happen to my country? What will happen to Shri Mataji? What will happen to Sahaja Yoga?" Then you can also ask, "What will happen to the world?" And then she says that Mother not only believes in giving you problems, but she believes in giving you solutions. And the solution is that you have to be very strong, very, very strong. For that, meditation is very important. So in all situations, Shri Ganesha reminds us. And Shri Ganesha also helps us to forgive easily. The more we are innocent, the easier it is for us to forgive.

Now, what happens exactly inside when we meditate is that these three channels we have within us—the left side, right side, and the center—we are always using them. What happens is the Kundalini goes up through the central channel, which is called the Brahma Nadi; it's very, very thin. Now, if the left side or right side is stronger, then it presses the middle channel, and the Kundalini cannot go up. When we meditate more and more, this channel opens out. First, it is closed because of the left or right side, then it opens out more and more, and that tube is there so the Kundalini can go up very easily. Shri Mataji talks about it very beautifully in the Sankranti Puja, '88, in Mumbai.

So this is what exactly happens when we meditate. Now, what are the effects of meditation? All these qualities of Shri Mataji, which are mentioned as qualities of the spirit—that we have compassion, we have love, we have forgiveness, witnessing power—all those things start manifesting through our spirit. You can say the spirit starts manifesting in our attention. So the more we meditate, the more it expresses.

I always give an image: it's like you have got a bulb, you have got the wire, and you have got the electricity. The more there is current, the more there is voltage, the more there is light in the bulb. So we can say, the more the Kundalini goes up, the more it gives brightness to our spirit. The spirit shines more brightly and brighter.

What happens is when we are in thoughtlessness... last time we spoke about it when Dushyant had asked me a question about how to keep our attention normal in all circumstances during the daytime. It is that in thoughtlessness—once we meditate deeply—that thoughtlessness can remain. Let's see what happens exactly when we are thoughtless. She talks about it in Gudi Padwa, '76. When you are in thoughtless awareness, you must know that you are in the kingdom of God. And his people, his arrangements, his consciousness is going to look after you. You have to understand that. When we say mantras, we say prayers. In all the other religions, everywhere, we say prayers. But the difference here is we get the acknowledgment. You get the realization that yes, whatever I do, I can feel it. It has worked, it has happened. It's just not thoughts, it's just not words.

When we get our realization, there are three detection instruments which happen within us: the Kundalini, the Sahasrara, and the vibrations. We have talked about this in the last session. Now let's see what happens at the Sahasrara. The Sahasrara is the Satyakhand. Shri Mataji talks about it in a talk about the Sahasrara in 1983, Delhi. So she says it's the Satyakhand. Whatever we feel on the Sahasrara has to be the truth. You might remember the promise which Shri Mataji gave in "How to Meditate," Mumbai, 1976. She says, "I am with you all the time, everywhere. You just close your eyes, and I am there with you." You just have to see it, and she is there. I always give an image: it's like when you see your computer screen, you don't want a program, so you just put it on the bottom of the screen. When you click on that, the whole thing comes out. The same thing happens when you put your attention on the Sahasrara and feel it; you can feel her presence.

And we know she has redeemed us, and she comforts us. We have seen it last time. She comforts us. So all these things happen, and she also helps us out in all situations. Shri Mataji says that the Sahasrara is the only instrument which will work out Sahaja Yoga in the modern times. It's in the Sahasrara Puja, 1991. Because what happens is, when your Sahasrara is open, all illusions, all misunderstandings, all the false ideas, all self-imposed ignorance drops out. Shri Mataji talks about it in 1998.

All these are the effects of meditation. And this depth of meditation gives us enlightened faith. Shri Mataji talks about it in 1993. What also happens is that it gives us surrendering powers. And the most important thing is, it gives us the power to change our surroundings. How do we change our surroundings? The more we go deeper within ourselves, the more our antennas grow outside. And those antennas, as we know with mobiles, send the waves, and that helps. The more we go deep, the more the antenna goes up. Shri Mataji talks about it in May '87, Sydney.

How does this happen? It is because of the vibrations. Now, these vibrations are not something dead. These vibrations are not dead stuff; it's something which is living. In December '78, somebody asked a question to Shri Mataji—it's a seven-minute talk—"What are vibrations?" And in that, Shri Mataji says that these vibrations, they have their communication centers. They do everything; you don't do anything. And she repeats, "They do everything; you don't do anything."

So if that is the case, we should try to emit those vibrations, and that comes also with meditation. There was one Sahaja Yogi in Mumbai, Mr. Phadke, who did a lot of experiments on vibrations. He told Shri Mataji, and Shri Mataji also would help him out with some replies. He insisted that he should write a book of all these experiences about vibrations. This book was written in Marathi, "On the Divine Cool Breeze," and it was also translated into English. You can see how the vibrations have helped in so many ways. I had the honor of knowing him; he was like a family member who would come to our house, so humble and so deep.

So these are the things which we can feel on our Sahasrara. I think now it's high time we go into meditation. It's very important to meditate because I feel without meditation, all words remain just words. It's the depth of the meditation which really helps us every time, every moment of our life. So we can just bow down to Shri Mataji and put on a bandhan. We can go into meditation afterwards.

We can all do it together. We can slowly raise our Kundalini and put ourselves into meditation, and we can just keep meditating.

Mataji, we, all the Sahaja Yogis of the world, those who are watching this video, humbly pray at your lotus feet and take your permission to enter the state of meditation. Please give us the permission to enter the state of meditation.

You can say the three Maha Mantras.

Now we can see an extract of Shri Mataji in which she explains the importance of meditation. This is an extract of two talks: Kundalini Puja 1993 and Diwali 2002. You can hear the amrut vani of Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji's Talk on Meditation

Shri Mataji is, of course, very intimate, that you should be in my body. But if you people are not meditating—it's a very mundane thing I must tell you—I have no relationship with you. You are not my relation. You have no right on me. You have no question to be asked, why this is happening, why that is happening. So if you do not meditate—I always say meditate, meditate—I have nothing to do with you. You are no more there for me. It has no connection with me.

Then you are like all other people. You may be Sahaja Yogis, you might have got your Sahaja Yoga degree from your leaders maybe, I don't know. And maybe that you are regarded as something very great. But if you do not do your meditation every day, evening or morning, you will be really not anymore in the realm of Shri Mataji. Because the connection is only through dhyana, through meditation.

I have known people who do not do meditation. Then they suffer, their children suffer, then something happens, then they start coming and telling me. But I see clearly that the person is not meditating. I have no relationship with him. He has no right to ask me anything. In the beginning, of course, the meditation takes some time. But once you will know what meditation is, how you enjoy my company, how you are one with me, how we can have a rapport with each other... There's no need to have anything else in between, like writing letters or maybe some sort of a special connection, nothing of that. The only thing that is needed is the meditation. In meditation you grow. In that, spiritually you become higher. And when that happens, you start, in a way, I would say, that when you reach a state of maturity in Sahaja Yoga, then you don't want to give up your meditation.

You are one with me. That doesn't mean for three hours, four hours you should do meditation. But it is how much intensely you are with me that is important. It is not how much time you are with me. Then I am responsible for you, for your children, for everyone. I am responsible for your ascent, for your protection, to save you from all your negativity.

So it's not like a father who will directly punish you. It's not that. But it's just, "All right, you are not my relation, I am out." That's the only thing that can happen. If you are not meditating, all right, I cannot force you. I have nothing to do with you. You may have other relationships, outside, outward. But this inner relationship by which you get your benevolence, you cannot have without meditation. I've been telling all of you, please meditate, please meditate every day. But I think people are also not understanding the importance of what I am saying. Because they tell me, "Mother, we don't meditate." Why? "Now we are realized, so why should we meditate?" Now this instrument is fully made. What's the use of having it?

In that meditation you will feel the love, the divine love, the beauty of that divine love. A complete panorama changes. A meditative person has a very different attitude, a very different temperament, a very different life, and he lives always in complete satisfaction with himself.

So today, being the first day of the Advent, we can say that if that is true, if it has happened and it has been a great blessing to you, then you must know how to preserve it, must know how to enhance it, must know how to enjoy it. You should not just get satisfied with one dance drama or one this thing or that. But you should have a full oneness with the Divine, full oneness, and that is possible only if you really meditate, which is quite an easy thing to do.

To meditate is... some people say, "Mother, we cannot get over time, we are all the time thinking something, or at that time we want to see the watch." In the beginning, you may have a little problem. I am not saying you may not have; you may have. But that's only in the beginning. But gradually you will be all right. Gradually you will master it. Gradually you will know it so well that you would not like to have anything else of a cheaper type. You wouldn't care for such a thing. So to get to your beauty, to get to your glory, to get to your own great personality which is now exposed to you, the only thing you have to do really, religiously, is to meditate.

Every day you should do meditation. Those who do not do meditation are capable of falling down, because meditation is like putting oil into the lamp. Those who do not meditate, and think they can do without it, are sadly mistaken. They have to meditate morning and evening. The problem is, everything comes so handy, so simple, that they don't understand that meditation is very important.

Not you, but there are many I know who get realization and don't meditate. And their style is different. Their nature is different. Meditation is such a soothing thing, such a beautiful way of connection with the Divine, that all your problems get solved in that meditative mood. If you are not meditating, you are not following meditation, then maybe your light will go down. It won't give sufficient clarity. It's important, very important, to find out about yourself, about others, in the meditation.

How to do meditation, many people ask. Don't do anything. Just go into thoughtless awareness. Try to go to thoughtless awareness. If you can get into that condition of thoughtless awareness, you've done your job. Because that's the point where you are with the truth, with the reality, with the joy, with everything that is so fundamental.

When you meditate, try not to make some sort of a function out of it. No. Meditation is something silencing yourself, silencing your thoughts, and going to that deep ocean which is within you itself. But supposing you don't do that, if you don't meditate... I can make out immediately those who are meditating and those who are not. It's not difficult for me. Those who do not meditate are always hesitating. They are confused. They can't understand. And that's why meditation is the most important thing in Sahaja Yoga.

Just like a light burns because of the electricity flowing in it, or because of the candles, in the same way, meditation is a continuous availability of the Divine Force. That will reduce all your apprehensions. Not only that, but it takes out all the negative thoughts. It takes out all the discouraging things. And when you are meditating like that, in thoughtless awareness, then you'll be amazed how you are helped from within and without. It's a terrible power that works, this thoughtless awareness. So those who do not meditate cannot go very much far with the advantage of Sahaja Yoga.

Once you try to meditate and go up to the point of thoughtless awareness... what happens to you? If you are in thoughtless awareness, what happens to you is that you get the confidence, complete confidence of Divinity. It's only possible when you meditate and become thoughtlessly aware. That's the point where the Divine works. It helps. It comes to your help in such a way that you don't know how you have achieved it.

That's the point all of you should achieve. Very important. After that, we can achieve something else. But the first step is thoughtless awareness. It's very important to become thoughtlessly aware because then there are no thoughts coming from the left or right, from the past or the future. Just in the present, you are there. It's something you all have. It's not that I'm saying that to you, but all of you have this. But you have to steady yourself at thoughtless awareness. For how long? That's not the point. The point is once you've touched it, you'll go on touching it.

Many people meditate, but their thought process is going on. They are not thoughtlessly silent. Now, this is the one point which is very important. If you have to grow, you should be absolutely in connection with the Divine through thoughtless awareness. You don't have to pray. You don't have to call anyone. Nothing. It just works because it is within you.

All these thoughts are bombarding your mind from both sides. These thoughts that are coming to you have no meaning within you. They do not substantiate you. Yourself, you are an ocean. And you have to get into that state of thoughtless awareness. It is always described: while meditating, go into thoughtless awareness. No thought is important because it's your own creation. But if you have to become one with the Divine creation, you have to get to that state of thoughtless awareness, minimum of minimum. Once that comes to you, gradually it will grow, and you'll be amazed how you will be able to grow into Sahaja Yoga in a very big way. Thank you very much.

Thank you, Shri Mataji, for these beautiful words of wisdom. These explanations, as only a mother can explain. As we said earlier, the deity who can really take us to the Nirvikalpa state is Shri Ganesha. Just pray, "Shri Ganesha, please forgive me if I have done anything wrong against your principles. I am completely surrendered to our mother, to your mother. But I don't know her. Please take me to her." With full devotion, we can say the mantra of Shri Ganesha four times, with the right hand on the Mother Earth, as if you are doing an aarti to Shri Ganesha who is in your Mooladhara Chakra.

Om Twameva Sākshāt Shrī Ganesha Sākshāt Shrī Ādi Shakti Mātājī Shrī Nirmalā Devyai Namo Namah. (x4)

You can feel a lightness. You can feel coolness. You can feel something moving. Maybe we do not feel anything. Just now, Shri Mataji talked a lot about thoughtlessness. In our meditation, we should try to reach that state of thoughtlessness. Our attention has to be thoughtless, because our attention always moves everywhere. It does not allow us to be in the thoughtless state. That state of thoughtless attention—then it is easier to go into the Sahasrara. So we can all listen to the amrut vani of Shri Mataji, where she talks about the importance of having a thoughtless attention.

Shri Mataji's Talk on Thoughtless Attention

So, the best thing for all of you is to become thoughtless. That's the blessing of Christ. That's what He worked out for you. He worked it out that you don't pay attention to others. Don't react. Just don't react. They will see everything, and they'll react. What is the need? What is the use? What are you going to do with that reaction? This reaction creates nothing but a ripple of thoughts in your mind. I have told you hundreds of times. And now you have to become absolutely thoughtless after this puja. If that happens, I think we have achieved a lot. That's the biggest blessing that Christ has given you, which you should really enjoy.

Then only this Akash Tattwa in you will work. And how it works? Through your attention. It works with me, as you know. With my attention, I work out many things. How? My attention has become thoughtless. Just thoughtless. It goes wherever it goes, it works. But if you put your attention to thought all the time, for thinking, then it doesn't do the work that it is supposed to do. Attention works marvelously if you are thoughtless, otherwise it doesn't.

So it has to rise from your own self, then from others, to the higher level of humanity, where you are in communication with the sky, which we can call it as the tanmatra or the essence of ether. With ether, you can have television, you can have a telephone. It's a miracle otherwise. But with this tanmatra, sitting down here, you can do the job. It works. Just attention works. I know that. You also know very well. You don't have to ask Me to put the attention. You just put the attention and it will work.

It's a very important thing that you have got. We get this thoughtless awareness by which our attention is absolutely free to do something. But if you are all the time thinking, then this poor attention is so busy. You don't have to ask Me then, "Mother, please pay attention." You can pay attention and you can work it out. In this attention, you don't feel what you've got, what you are standing on, what you are wearing, what others are doing. No, nothing. You are one with yourself.

You can keep our eyes open. These are the photos of Shri Mahashivaratri Puja, '76 or '77. Let me put all my thoughts and all my worries at your lotus feet. Please give me the blessings of thoughtless attention.

Thoughtlessness is called nirvichara. Attention is called chitta. The one who bestows upon us is called pradayini, like moksha pradayini. We will all just say once the mantra of Shri Nirvichara Chitta Pradayini.

Om Twameva Sākshāt Shrī Nirvichāra Chitta Pradāyinī Sākshāt Shrī Ādi Shakti Mātājī Shrī Nirmalā Devyai Namo Namah.

Try to see, you can close our eyes... if you can attain this state of thoughtlessness inside.

As we know, Shri Ganesha is present on all the chakras. So on the Agnya Chakra, we can awaken his qualities by saying the Shri Ganesha Atharvashirsha, with the right hand on the Agnya Chakra, crosswise. Put it on the forehead. Press it. Bend our head slightly in the front.

(Shri Ganesha Atharvashirsha is recited.)

We can take down our hand. No thoughts. Literally see the thoughtlessness, like a blank screen on the television. And also hear the silence within us. Absolute silence. We can feel the vibrations in our hands. Let us remain in this state for some time, so that this state is more established before we go and meet Shri Mataji in the Sahasrara.

Now we can put the palm of our right hand on the Sahasrara. Bend our head in the front. With full humility, ask Shri Mataji for her permission to come in her domain, to come in her kingdom, to be in her company. "Shri Mataji, please accept me as your child, whatever limitations, whatever drawbacks I have. Let me feel the joy of Sahasrara. Let me feel the Nirananda. Please give me the blessings of Nirvikalpa in my Sahasrara."

You can just say once the mantra of Shri Nirvikalpa Sthiti Pradayini.

You can raise your hand a little bit. Try to feel the vibrations coming out of your Sahasrara. Raise your hand more and more. Still feel the cool breeze coming out. Then you can put down the hand.

Now starts the second and the most important stage of meditation, where we do not do anything. Here, you just be. The first stage is called Nyasa. It's the preparation where we say the mantras, we say the affirmations, we listen to the talk. We do everything. Here, we don't do anything. Just be in the presence of Shri Mataji. Suck her vibrations through our Sahasrara. That's all. Let's be in this state for some time. This is when Shri Mataji nourishes us.

Thank you, Shri Mataji. Thank you very much for giving us this opportunity to be in your company, to allow us to feel the Sahasrara, to take us into the state of Nirvikalpa. Thank you again and again.

Jai Shri Mataji.

We can sing the three Mahamantras. Jai Shri Mataji.

So, we can end this small session with a prayer to Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji, in these four sessions, I have tried to share the blissful moments I had the opportunity to be with you, to share the miracles, to share the experiences. If during this sharing I have done any mistakes in the protocol, or if anywhere my ego was interfering, I ask for your forgiveness. From my heart, my only desire is that my brothers and sisters should all go into the Nirvikalpa state before 21st March 2023. And if these sessions help them to realize Shri Mataji, who is Adi Shakti, it will be a very humble offering. Jai Shri Mataji.

Jai Shri Mataji, Uncle. A wonderful meditation session. I don't think there is anything left to say. The experience was truly wonderful, to say the least. With a prayer to Mother, Uncle, we'll end today's session.

To everyone who's listening to these sessions, as mentioned earlier, links to the earlier sessions can be found in the description of this particular one. Please do go through those sessions as well. There are some beautiful experiences that were shared.

We would like to thank Mother for blessing us with this wonderful session and this series of sessions. With today's session, we'll end this series. We'll try and formulate some other series as well shortly. But this is the last session in the series that we are doing with you. Jai Shri Mataji to everyone. With Mother's blessing, we'll end today's session.

Jai Shri Mataji. My love to all.
