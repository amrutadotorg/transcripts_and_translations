So, should I just start with the questions? I'll just tell a few words and then the questions.

First of all, I thank Shri Mataji for giving me this opportunity to talk before my brothers and sisters. And thank you, Caroline, for inviting me. It's my pleasure to share some beautiful moments with Shri Mataji.

The fact that we came earlier does not, I always felt, mean that we are more progressed or anything like that. It's only that somehow it was our good fortune that Shri Mataji brought us into Sahaja Yoga earlier. I always feel it's like a lift which goes from the ground floor to the seventh floor. We came on the first floor, the lift comes on the fourth or fifth floor, and everybody is at the same level. It's a collective consciousness. And secondly, when I see some of these young ones so dynamic, so deep, it gives me a lot of hope for Sahaja Yoga for the future. The only thing is, if I may say, we saw Sahaja Yoga right from a few droplets. Now it's become a big river. I'm sure it will become the sea and then the ocean. So that's the advantage you can see.

This is for all the Sahaja Yogis, what I'm sharing. And these experiences I have just selected are more collective. Whatever Shri Mataji has told us, very personal things or very personal matters which are not very much useful for the collective, I have not included in this. Same with the photos. Okay, so you can start the questions.

How and when did you get your realization?

It was on the 14th of April, 1972, that I got my realization, along with my sister Meenakshi. We were in a place called Jivanjot. I’m telling these places in case somebody wants to go when you're in Mumbai; you can visit these places. There was a big road called Napean Sea Road, and there was a crossroad, Setalvad Crossroad. It is a dead-end road, sort of; you cannot go to the other side. So at the end, there was a sea, and on the left-hand side, there's a building called Jivanjot. Shri Mataji was staying on the second floor. Sir CP had a flat there, and Shri Mataji used to invite all of us about 10 o'clock in the morning and give us realization. We were maybe 30 or 40 people.

Then we had to go on her feet or on her hands. When my turn came, it was in the hand, left hand. She put that oil on my head, Ramtirth Brahmi oil. She asked me, "How do you feel?" I said, "Fine." Then she asked my name, and she liked my name. That was it. This was the beginning of the journey.

Wow. And that's 50 years ago now?

Yes.

So the next question is if you can tell me something about the early days. You want me to share the photos straight away?

Yes, please. I will tell you about the early days along with the photos, and for each photo, there is some story behind it. That's why I've selected them. You'll have to excuse any mistakes on my part because some of the photos are in a different medium.

This is fine. So these are my parents. The story behind it is that it was in 1973. I remember these years because we were in school, so it was the last year in school. My sister and myself, we could not go, but my parents went. It is a place called Vasai, which is rather far from Bombay, and you go by suburban train on the western line. My father said, "How can Shri Mataji come in the second class or third class?" and he took first-class tickets. But Shri Mataji came with all the Sahaja Yogis in the third class and they went to this place called Vasai, and the photo was taken there.

Shri Mataji moved to the UK in December 1973. Each time when she used to come, and while going back, it was always a very emotional moment. She used to hug all the women, but not all of them, and then she used to go. This is one of the photos from Santa Cruz International Airport.

And whenever we used to meet, Shri Mataji used to sit and eat with us. So you see Shri Mataji sitting and eating with us. On the side also, there are yogis sitting. She used to sit on the ground and eat with us.

The next photograph, my father is holding this mic for Shri Mataji, and on the right-hand side, you can see a small tape recorder. The story goes that this was the tape recorder which taped all the talks from right from 1972, when we got our realization, till about 1980. It was the only one. We had these six-inch spools with four tracks, 3.5 hours each track, so it's 14 hours each spool. We used to take that tape recorder everywhere. It was the only tape recorder from Bombay. Everywhere we used to go, we used to take that, and all those old talks are from this machine.

The story is that my father, when he saw it the first time—he got his realization in January 1972 and he took us in April 1972—when he heard Shri Mataji talking, he felt it was so deep and so powerful. He said, "Really, somebody should tape it." A few days later, his friend said, "I want to sell one tape recorder," and he said, "I would like to take it." And we bought it. Even once when it was not working, Shri Mataji put kumkum on it.

The story goes that in 1984, Shri Mataji sent a word with somebody saying, "This man who's going to come, you give all the spools to him." We had 36 spools because all those talks, Jitendra Abhisheki or Ajit Kadkade, all that music, everything was in those spools. Shri Mataji said, "You give these 36 spools to him," and I think they went to the UK. So they're in the UK. This is the story of this tape recorder.

Now, this photo was taken in January or February 1977. It was in Bordi. You can see some yogis whom you can recognize. That's Pat right in the middle at the end. Then there is Maureen on his left. There is Kevin in front of him, and this is Jane. And on his left is Maureen. And there were some Raul boys on the left of Shri Mataji. I was sitting behind on the right. Then there is Chavan uncle in the front on the left, and Dumal uncle is also there. This was in Bordi.

This is in Bordi before Ganpati Pule. Ganpati Pule started in December '85. From '73 till February '85, we used to go to Bordi for the seminar. I got married in February '85 in Bordi; that was the last Bordi seminar. This was a small group, maybe 15 or 20 more. And this is this place called Devanji; his bungalow is too high. Meenakshi is sitting in the front, you can see her. This is the same photo which we saw just now in Bordi. It should be in '77, January or February. Same photo, but it's not that clear.

This photo, I don't know the year, should be from '73, '74 till about '76. This was sort of the whole group. Shri Mataji is in the middle, looking downwards.

We used to have pujas in Bordi. This was the puja to put water on Shri Mataji's feet. My father used to chant mantras. This was, we can say, the first puja in Sahaja Yoga. He's on the left. This was in the India tour of 1979-80, I think. We were in Bordi, I think. And before the Havan, she used to give instructions, and I was writing down all the instructions. Then she used to put kumkum for people who were sitting for the Havan. All these photos are basically from Western Sahaja Yogis who gave me photos later on. So, fortunately, I'm there in some of them.

Here we are preparing for the Havan. The small girl standing on the right-hand side is Aradhana, the eldest granddaughter of Shri Mataji. On her right is Anupama, to whom Shri Mataji is putting kumkum. You can just see my head on the right. She's putting kumkum on everybody.

This is also a photo where in the front, the boy on the left is Sandeep Garkari. And behind him, his name is Bankim. He was staying in Borivali, now he's I think still in Dubai.

This is the place called Nilambar. It was on the 13th floor in the building called Nilambar on Pedder Road in Mumbai. In '78, I got my B.Sc. and was trying for my M.Sc., and I did not get it very easily. So my father said, "You be with Shri Mataji since she's here." The first marriage took place here, and Shri Mataji was staying with us. She was having a room, then another room for the ladies, and we were sleeping in the living room. This is that photo.

Once Shri Mataji told us to go on the beach. And when she used to come, she used to always crack jokes, always in a very jovial mood. And she was cracking some joke.

This is in '83 in Rahuri. She had allowed us to take some photos with her. This is Mr. Dhumal, Dhumal uncle, whom you know. He's sitting with Shri Mataji.

This is a group photo. In the extreme right is Sandeep's mother. In the extreme left is Karaka uncle. Shri Mataji allowed us to take a photo with her.

Now, when I came to France, this photo was given to me as a present by one Mr. Warik, Warik uncle. This was the photo which was on the passport of Shri Mataji when she first moved to the UK in December '73. There were just three original ones, and he gave me his own photo, one of them. At that time, we could not make copies or anything, so it was quite a good present, which I digitized for everybody.

This was in 1990 in Montferrand, in my ashram in Paris. Shri Mataji was giving Indian names to Westerners. The person on the left you will see is Richard from Holland, and I was writing them down with the meaning of the names.

In '78, '79, I told you I was with Shri Mataji almost for a year. This was in February '79, from the 10th to the 16th. It was a place called 10 Ashoka Road in New Delhi. We were there with Shri Mataji. There was a pandal, and we used to have a public program every evening in this garden. Here were all these other men. You must be knowing some of them. I'm sure everybody's changed a lot since this photograph was taken.

On the right, you can see who's sitting. That's Uncle Gregory, second on the right. Then there was Lindsay, who was the first person to get married, on his right. There's Douglas, and there's Gavin. On the right, in front of Gregory is Tony. And behind Gregory is Rustam. By the tree, you have Don Divine. On my left is Mr. Venugopalan. On the left-hand side of Shri Mataji, on the ground, is Mr. Subramaniam, also one of the old Sahaja Yogis in Delhi. Then, on the right of Shri Mataji, sitting on the ground, is Mr. Verma. He was always there with Shri Mataji for shopping and everything.

These were the Yoginis with Shri Mataji. On the left, there was Philippa, she was a journalist. Sandy. Then, there was Ellen on her left. Sitting second from the left is Chaya. And on the extreme right, sitting, is Mari. On her right is Jane. And then there are the Raul sisters behind, standing.

The photos are finished. Just to tell you how it happened in the early days, sometimes when my father was coming home late—he used to come at five, but in case he was late—we knew that he had gone to Shri Mataji's house. He used to call her and ask if he could come and meet, so he used to go.

For example, the 1973 Navaratri Puja, we had a nine-day puja on her terrace at Jivanjot. Once, while answering one question, she said that even one leaf cannot move in the world without the orders coming from her Kundalini. She showed like this, from her Kundalini. We used to massage her head with Silvikrin, and in one of the talks in Marathi, she said even Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh cannot touch her head, but she has allowed Sahaja Yogis to touch her head. So she had given us a lot of rights. For example, she came to our house three times and we had done puja.

In Gita Mandir Hall and Bharti Vidyabhavan in Mumbai in '73, '74, we used to have public programs morning and evening. After the public program, every time, we used to go on her feet to do our prayers. All those memories.

The bandhans for your exams?

Yes. She had corrected my covering letter for a job. And sometimes, some of us used to tell her, "Shri Mataji, please put bandhan, I'm going to give my exams." She used to put bandhans.

Also, there was an instance at the '85 birthday puja. One of us gave her a ring, and she said no. Then, this person who was giving the ring just closed his eyes, and immediately, Shri Mataji put her finger in the front, and he put the ring on her finger. Then I asked him, "What did you say when you closed your eyes, so that Shri Mataji offered her finger?" He said, "Mother, let my desire be so pure that you accept this small ring from me." And Shri Mataji immediately put her finger in the front.

And many things... like once in Bombay, we used to get milk from Aarey Milk Colony. It was the only source of getting milk in Bombay, and they were on strike. There was not a drop of milk, but somehow, they got some milk at 10 o'clock in the morning. I was with Shri Mataji, and it was the first cup of tea. She poured half of that small cup in a saucer and gave it to me. I said, "No, no, I don't want." She said, "No, no, no, you take." I don't know how, maybe she drank just a few drops. So, all these small, lots of small memories.

Did you say about coming to your house three times? Yes. And the kerosene from abroad, you haven't mentioned.

Yeah, because I had a lung infection. And when I called Shri Mataji, she was in Australia. She said, "No, no, take everything what is necessary for your lung infection." And she sent some kerosene. It was really very helpful to cure the lung problem. Then she said, "Your father was very sick, and that's why you got this lung problem. But now it's much clearer because of this." So, just to tell you that even if something bad happens, there's certainly something good going to happen. This is the story I wanted to convey.

Can you tell me something about her availability for her children?

Yeah. In '73, '74, '75—I don't know the years exactly—in a place called Prabhadevi, there's one of these Ganesha temples. Beside it, there is a garden, and in front, there was this old building where we used to have the meditation right in the beginning. We were just a few. And every year, on the terrace, we used to have a pandal. Shri Mataji used to come for the birthday puja. She would come in the morning, we used to have puja, havan, we used to sing songs. And that time, we could not take vibrations, so we had to put our hand on her back, on her head, like this.

In the evening, about 9 or 10 o'clock, she used to go home. Once, I had this opportunity to go with her to her house because a lot of flowers were there, and they said, "Do you want to come to bring the flowers?" She was staying in Kalpana Devi's house. And when I went, I saw that so many people had come, about 30 or 40—Sir CP's colleagues, family, friends, everybody—to wish Shri Mataji. And Shri Mataji was with us for the whole day. So, I really felt how much time she had given to us, especially people from Bombay.

Can I ask a question about that? You mentioned Shri Mataji sent some kerosene. I believe we call it Vaseline. Am I correct?

No. Kerosene is what you put for the aeroplanes, that kerosene. It's liquid, it's a fuel.

Really? So that's like petrol, then?

Yes, for burning, for cooking, for heating.

And Mother was giving actual kerosene? Because in Portugal, Mother told us Vaseline instead of kerosene.

No, she said you mix it with olive oil because it smells quite strong. So, mix it with that, and then put it on your chest.

Right. So, mixed with oil. Yes, I understand. Because in Portugal, we did not have kerosene; it's not available.

Yeah, I know in France, it's difficult to get. So Mother told us we could use Vaseline. And basically, probably a similar treatment.

No, because she had it sent from Australia. Patrick Lantois was there, so she sent it.

I believe Vaseline is made out of petrol. This is why she suggested Vaseline.

Yes, Vaseline is also a by-product from petrol. So they are related, but different. Thank you for that.

And so now, I have how she calmed us.

Basically, I used to smoke, even after realization. I used to smoke two or three cigarettes per year when I used to go out with friends for a weekend. We used to drink, smoke, so I used to smoke also, just to give them company. You know how friends are, they force you and all that. So, once I was in Goa with another friend and I smoked. A week later, on the 5th of February, '76, there was a puja. After the puja, we used to go on her feet. And when I went on her feet, Shri Mataji suddenly said, "Did you smoke?" My heart really, literally stopped, and I didn't say anything.

Then again, I used to go with friends and again I used to smoke. And then in '79, when I was in Dhulia, in Raul Bai's house, they had a havan. There, Shri Mataji said, "I want somebody, a man, who has never smoked in his life." All the Westerners said, "No, they have smoked." Even the Indians, they smoked bidis. So I pulled my ears and looked down. I said, "No, not the second time."

In the evening, I started having a very strong smell from my Vishuddhi fingers. They were so strong. We were in a small village for the public program, and I came home, washed my hands properly, but still, it did not go away. I was getting worried now because we were all with Sahaja Yogis and it was rather strong. At that time, I used to go to Shri Mataji's room and say, "Shri Mataji, there is a problem." So she said, "Okay, come here." She took my fingers like this in her hands, and in about two or three minutes, she said, "Okay, now smell." And the smell was gone completely.

She said, "Because you have accepted this morning that you smoked, I am taking out all your smoke, all your cigarettes, from your body. Your karma. It means, in your life, if you tell somebody now, 'I've never smoked in my life,' that is true, that is not false. That part I have taken it out. So, now, you promise that you will not smoke." Of course, I promised, and I did not smoke.

Later, in the West, I once had a brain scan, and for a carotid artery check, two different doctors said, "Yes, the brain is so clear that you can see you have never smoked in your life, because any smoke gives a stain." I said, "Yeah, I never smoked in my life." So, this is how she cleaned our karmas.

Wow. And then, how does she clean us physically?

Now, I always have been very sensitive to the sun. If I go a lot in the sun, I have a headache. When we were in Nilambar, every evening, Shri Mataji used to make us laugh with lots of jokes and things like this. I was sitting with a very bad headache. So she said, "What's happening?" I said, "Really, I've got a very bad headache." She said, "Come on, you put your hand on my liver." So I put my hand on her liver, and in about five or ten minutes, I had to go for diarrhea and vomiting. Really, literally, I was completely vacuumed from inside. I came back, and the headache was completely gone.

Also, on this day called Akshaya Tritiya in our Indian tradition, it's a very auspicious day during the year. We used to have a puja in this place, Marve, and the whole day we used to be there with Shri Mataji. In the evening, once I remember, she told us to stand in her circle. We were something like 15 or 20. And she worked on us individually, like this, while we were standing on the wet sand. She worked on everybody. I remember she said that wet sand is the best element to take everything that is blocking in your body. It can really clean you very well. It's a very good element, wet sand, but on the seashore. I don't think if you do it at home it will work.

Also, we used to go to Ganpati Pule and do this three-point treatment for the Mooladhara. You sit on the ground with your feet, with the heels in the ground, the knees bent, and your hands you can put behind. So basically, you touch with your Mooladhara physically, you touch with the heels, which is the Mooladhara, and with your hands. This three-point treatment can really help, because Ganpati Pule is the best place to clear our Mooladhara. So we ask Mother Earth to suck in all these Mooladhara problems.

And it says also, sitting in the sea with her feet towards the sea?

Yeah, because when we were small, I don't know where it was, but I still remember these small incidents where she used to sit in the sea with her feet in the sea like this, and the waves used to come. We, like small children, used to go and put our head against her feet. Imagine, our nose was in the water when the waves were coming. We used to do some sort of a competition, who will stay more in the water. These small little incidents. I did not realize that she was really vibrating the Arabian Sea.

So you have some instances of how she knows what's going on in our mind?

Yes. I had always this ear problem. My ear was weak and all that. So we put some drops, this, that, but nothing happened. Nothing worked out. Then I went to Shri Mataji and said, "Please, can you just see, there's some problem." She took my left ear with her right hand, like this, and she started blowing. Immediately, a thought came in my head: "All these medicines did not work. What will this blowing do?" And Shri Mataji immediately left my hand. She said, "Why are you thinking like this? You know what I am putting? I am putting the real on your ear." Obviously, because I doubted, it never worked.

Also, we were in Rahuri, and after the food, we used to say couplets, like after marriages. In the afternoon, people used to ask Shri Mataji to ask some people to say the couplets. I immediately made a couplet, but Shri Mataji didn't ask, so I did not say it. In the evening, the same program happened, and then Shri Mataji said, "Okay, now you say the couplet." So I said the couplet. She said immediately, "But this couplet, you had made in the morning." And I said, "Yes, yes, yes." Then she said, "How did I know? You know, how did I know?" These are the small, little incidences.

And once we went to Shri Mataji early in the morning and did not have time to take our bath. Immediately, she was telling the others, "Ah, these people, when they come in the morning, they always have their bath." My sister was there with me. So, she knows exactly, but she's so diplomatic. We had to meet Adi Shakti; we had to take our bath, and we had not done it.

And Shri Mataji's reply concerning the fourth dimension?

Yeah. So, in '77, we had been to Jaipur. In Jaipur, you get very good pearls. They are imitation pearls, but they are very, very good quality. So we had taken some pearls and a very special sari, a Bandhani sari, from Jaipur. I was the postman, and my father said, "Now, did you take these for Shri Mataji?" So I took all of them to Shri Mataji, and she said, "Why are you bringing all these?" I tried to be smart. I said, "Shri Mataji, what you have given us is in the fourth dimension, this is just three dimensions." Immediately, she replied, "So, give me the fourth dimension."

How she protects her children?

Basically, there are two real miracles in my life with Shri Mataji. One of them was about my karma, how she took it out, and this is the second one which I'm going to tell. We used to have these public programs I told you about, in Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan Hall, on the third floor, at Chowpatty. Once, for the taping, I was sitting in the front, and Shri Mataji just looked somewhere. In Marathi, we call it kataksha. Kataksha means it's a stern glance. We say Devi gives that kataksha, and she just looks at something and she knows what it is. Slowly, I saw whom did she give this kataksha to, and I saw a man with a beard, like a sadhu, with long hair and all that.

I was quite curious and wanted to know why he had come. When I went to ask him if he wanted his realization, he just told me like this, "Leave me alone," sort of. So I said okay. Then, while Shri Mataji got up and was about to go, he came from the opposite direction towards Shri Mataji. We were ready to intervene in case he did something to Shri Mataji. But when he came in front of Shri Mataji, he fell down like a coconut tree on her feet. Before he could fall down, Shri Mataji just touched his Agnya Chakra, I don't know, with her Agnya Chakra or with her thumb. He gave a big sigh of relief, like this, and he went away. Shri Mataji also went.

Then we asked, "Who was this man? What happened exactly?" She said that these are the Hatha Yogis who are coming from the jungles, from the Himalayas. We all know only Adi Shakti can give realization, nobody else. She said that he came here to get his realization, and they know me much better than you know me. When I put my hand on his Agnya Chakra, he got his realization. But for these people, when their Kundalini gets stuck in the Agnya Chakra, it pains like a thousand bees stinging at the same time. It's very, very painful. When I put my finger, his Kundalini rose up, and the pain was gone. So he felt relieved, and he went.

Then she said that you Sahaja Yogis, you sometimes feel just some pressure, some tingling, some burning sensation because my protection is always there on your head. She said that. And that's why you don't feel that much.

How she fulfills our desires?

Small desires, like when we were in Rahuri, I was young and we were about to eat at a sort of an oval table. I was doing many things and was the last to come. Everybody had sat down, and on the left-hand side only, there was one chair left. They used to give chapatis, and I like chapatis very much. They used to give chapatis with butter to Shri Mataji, and for us, without butter. And I like them with butter. So they brought four very hot chapatis to Shri Mataji, and she just took out one chapati and put it in my plate. I said, "No, Shri Mataji," and she said, "I know you like them." I did not really desire it, but when she puts it, you just eat.

The second thing happened in Solapur. We were in a small room, about 10-15 people. Shri Mataji said, "Okay, we go to bed now." While going out, I just had the thought, because the vibrations were so much in this room, "The person who is going to sleep in this room is such a lucky person." I knew somebody was sleeping there, but I didn't know who. Then we were in another room, about to go to bed, and that person came—Dhumal uncle was going to sleep there—and he said, "Do you have space? If you don't, you can come to our room." I really jumped, literally jumped, and went to sleep in their room.

It was a rectangular room. On the two sides, Shri Mataji and Uncle Dhumal were sleeping on beds parallel at the edge. I was sleeping in the middle on the ground. Shri Mataji had already slept. Suddenly, at I don't know what time, I thought that somebody had touched me and stumbled over me. I just got up and saw that I was in Shri Mataji's room. My sleep went off. Dhumal uncle said Shri Mataji was vomiting the whole night because she was cleaning Solapur. When she came back, she sat down, and that time we used to massage her feet very often. I told Shri Mataji of my thought the night before, saying that there were such good vibrations and the person sleeping there was so lucky. She said, "Yes, because of this thought, I brought you here to sleep."

There was also the story about the sweater in Dhulia. My mother had lost her sweater, and we were to go to Delhi. My mother said, "You buy a sweater from Delhi for me." So this Verma uncle, whom I had mentioned, used to go with Shri Mataji for the shopping. I told him, "Can you buy one sweater for my mother?" He said, "Okay." When he came back in the evening, he said, "Ah, Mother liked you very much." I said, "What is he talking about?" I had told him "my mother" and he thought "our Mother, Shri Mataji." So he bought a sweater for Shri Mataji. It was a very Kashmiri one, just one piece left and all that.

Basically, what had happened was, when I was in Delhi, I was a student. Others used to give presents to Shri Mataji, like a purse and a sari, and I thought, "Ah, I don't even know how to buy a handkerchief." I was a student, and I said, "I don't know how I can give anything to Shri Mataji." Suddenly, my desire, Shri Mataji took it over. It was a lovely Kashmiri sweater. He put it through a ring, you know, that light but very strong. It was just a desire which Shri Mataji fulfilled.

And then, instances of how she knows without being told?

When I was with Shri Mataji in Nilambar, I was taking care of the money for day-to-day activities, like shopping for flowers, vegetables, rice, newspapers for Shri Mataji. We had some Western people with us, and Shri Mataji was telling me to take them to different places like Elephanta Caves or Marve, Mud Island, to the cinema, to entertain them in Bombay. It was rather hot, and they used to feel thirsty, and we used to go and have some Limca. One or two of them never had the habit of paying, so my restaurant fellow used to ask me, and I used to pay for them always. My father said, "Don't take money from them because the guests are like gods." Okay, but it was quite a lot of money for me. Every time I used to go, I used to pay.

The next year, '79, when the Westerners came, they did not give me any work. I was quite surprised because when the Westerners come to Bombay, everybody has a particular job to do. Then I heard that the leader at that time had passed a rumor that when I was in Nilambar, I stole Sahaja Yoga money. I felt like laughing; it was just the opposite.

Then we were in Borivali, and there was a public program. Shri Mataji said, "All these foreigners, you take them to this island," which you saw in that photo. Then she said to me, "Don't spend money on them." And she told everybody, "Abhijit spent a lot of money for you people. Don't allow him to spend money on you." So, literally, she gave me a clean sheet without me telling her anything.

Another thing about money is, at the '82 Mahakali Puja, my father was taking care of all the organization, and at that time we used to have cash. He told me, "Abhijit, why don't you just go and count how much we have." I was counting and there was nobody in the room. I counted and kept it. After the puja, when he came back, the money was gone. All the money was gone. We were all Sahaja Yogis there. We said, "Okay, we will go and tell Shri Mataji," who was in another bungalow. We went there, and Shri Mataji was sleeping. We just prayed to her in front of her door; we did not disturb her. When we came back, everybody was asking what happened. We said, "We have told Shri Mataji." She said, "Don't worry, I will take care of it." The next morning, the money came back.

In fact, a Sahaja Yogi had seen me counting and knew where the money was. He had a very weak moment, took the money, and then he felt repentant and gave back the money. In another village, Shri Mataji told something about this very indirectly to him. Just two or three of us could understand that Shri Mataji really knew what she was saying and she knew that he had taken the money.

Small instances of her love for her children?

So, I told you about the tea when she gave me a little bit. Secondly, once I was in the lift in Satyam Apartments. I used to always go for taking the big tapes and we used to put them on small cassettes. I used to take it to her so that Shri Mataji would take it to the UK to listen to Bhimsen Joshi and things like that. Once, I met Shri Mataji in the lift. I don't know if she put her hand on my head or something, but anyway, she told me, "Touch your head." I touched it and she said, "Oh, is it hot?" I said, "Yeah, very hot." She asked me from where I was coming and then she said, "You should always cover your head. In the sun, you should never go out without covering your head." I had come about 20 or 30 minutes walking in the sun.

Also, once I wanted to go—I had joined judo. I was with Shri Mataji, and I said, "I want to go." She said, "Where do you want to go?" I said, "I'm doing judo." She said, "Judo? No, no, no. Sahaja Yogis should never do judo." I said, "But I had bought this special dress, kimono or whatever you call it." She said, "No, no, no." Her special phrase was "throw them in the sea" (samudraat phekून de). I said I would stop doing judo. So, she was sometimes quite stern with us, but we could really realize her love for us. She gave us warnings directly, indirectly, so many things.

So, this carries on to how she corrects her children.

Yes. There was Warren, you must be knowing, who had started Sahaja Yoga in Australia. The first year when he came, he did not get along with anybody. Shri Mataji told me to sit with him in the car to give him mantras. I still remember in the villages, I wrote all the mantras for him and everything. He went and came back with 35 or 40 Australian Sahaja Yogis, which we had never seen before. He had a sort of a liking for our family. When he came back, he brought a flash for the camera, which was separate at that time, and cassettes. Our tape recorder needed a new head because the head used to get worn out from taping, and we did not get that head in Bombay or in India. So we told him to bring one, and he brought it.

I told Shri Mataji that he did not want to take any money for that. I told Shri Mataji, "Just ask him to take money." She was very, very angry with me. She took my ear in her hand, she pulled my ear and said, "Are you doing business? Sahaja Yoga is not for business. Throw everything in the sea." That time, I pulled my ears. We used to not answer back, but argue. I said, "We can throw everything, but the head we don't get in India." She said, "Okay, the head you can keep, but the rest of the things you give back or throw away. You should not make any money out of Sahaja Yoga." It was a big lesson for me.

So, how she taught not to pay attention to one yogi?

Yes. What happened was, there was one Mr. Devle, who used to sort of cure people and all that. Shri Mataji told him not to do that. She wrote a very beautiful small letter, but he took it so badly and he went out of Sahaja Yoga. That was in May. Then, in August, I had to go for my postgraduate studies in Nagpur. She had come the earlier day and told me, "You come next day and take a tape recorder for her family." So I went rather early because I was staying quite far and I had a train at 12:30. We had to sort of wake her up once or even twice. That time she got up and looked very, very disturbed. I said, "Shri Mataji, I'm really sorry to have woken you up." She said, "No, no, you did not disturb me. But when these people like Devle go out of Sahaja Yoga, there is a vortex in the air. People who are close to him, they get caught up in that vortex and they also go down."

For me, it was a big lesson that, however close the Sahaja yogis, we should not have too much attachment because we are our own gurus. Then she said that he was a very ardent disciple of Shirdi Sai Baba. She gave me an example: "Now, Shirdi Sai Baba is not there. I am there. So if there is an inspector and then the inspector becomes a commissioner, you should go to the commissioner, not to the inspector." She said, "Shirdi Sai Baba is not happy with him and he has to take him down." This is something which I wanted to share with you.

We've seen other instances of that vortex as well.

In 1976, Shri Mataji tells it very, very clearly how to meditate in Mumbai. It's in Hindi, but the translation is available in Amruta. She tells about this, that those people who have gone out of Sahaja Yoga, we should not have any relations with them.

And so, yes, examples of what happens when we have attachments for ex-yogis.

There was a Sahaja Yogi, Mr. Bhatt, and he used to be a chain smoker. Immediately, he stopped smoking. Then, there was Mr. Kamath, through whom he had come to Sahaja Yoga. This Kamath, for some reason, got out of Sahaja Yoga. Once, Mr. Bhatt wanted to go and just visit him. When he came out, he started smoking. Again, he became a chain smoker. Shri Mataji worked on him for two or three years. I remember in Nilambar, for one and a half hours she worked on him. When she used to work, she used to put the Sudarshan Chakra on his Vishuddhi, and she used to say, "Aham Sakshat Shri Krishna, Aham Sakshat Shri Krishna."

Of course, he was cured. Then I asked Mr. Bhatt what happened. He said in the beginning, it was quite good, but later on, he had such a strong sort of possession on his Vishuddhi which wanted him to smoke. This is just what happens. He just made one visit to this ex-yogi.

How the deities work for Shri Mataji?

There was one Mr. Iyengar, who was a civil engineer in the US. He got his realization. When he came to Bombay, he gave his cards to everybody with his telephone number, everything. On them was written, "To give realization: one dollar. To give vibrations: two dollars," something like that. Shri Mataji wanted him to come to Delhi. We were in Kalpana Devi's place on the fourth floor, and they were talking. Suddenly, he said to Shri Mataji, "It's so difficult to contact you. It's easier to contact the Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi, than to contact you." We were all rather angry with him. This Modi uncle who was the leader at that time, he just got up. He was six feet tall. He just got up and said, "One more word, Mr. Iyengar, and I'll throw you out of the window." He was really threatening.

Then this Iyengar got up and said, "Bye-bye, Madam," to Shri Mataji and went away. He went to the jungles and found a real guru somewhere in Orissa. This guru said, "Do you know whom you've insulted? You've insulted Adi Shakti. Now you go and ask for her forgiveness." In his repentance, he made a bald head, cut all his hair, and came to ask for forgiveness from Shri Mataji. On the airport, the first time he came, the taxis were on strike, so he could not come on time and Shri Mataji left. The second time, Shri Mataji left just five minutes early and he came. Shri Mataji said, "Because he has insulted me, Hanumana will see that he will never come in front of me."

But on the other hand, when she wants to meet someone, how the deities work?

It happened in Greece in 1999. We had Diwali Puja, and I had a dance in front. I cannot dance, but really, I wanted to dance. Shri Mataji went to the toilet, and everyone used to put their shawls down for her to walk on. I was thinking, "Should I put mine? I should not put it." In the meantime, everybody put their shawl down, and Shri Mataji was in the toilet. I put my shawl last, right in front of the toilet. So when Shri Mataji came out, my shawl was the first one.

The person attending to Shri Mataji was right in front of me, and she said, "Shri Mataji wants to see you tomorrow morning." I said, "Okay." I thought, "If I would not have put the shawl, I would never have come here, and it would not be possible to give me this message." But she said, "No. When Shri Mataji wants to see anybody, it somehow happens. You don't have to do anything."

This was the first incident. In Cabella also, once at night Shri Mataji said, "Call Abhijit," and somehow they could not contact me. So, a weekend afterwards, when I went there, I heard about it. We had gone out, and when I came back, it was very dark. I was coming up to open the big door from inside because there was an aged lady with me. There's a big staircase in front of Shri Mataji's kitchen, if you remember. When you come up, you can open the door from inside. When I came up, I saw on the right-hand side in the living room Shri Mataji was sitting along with Sir CP and listening to Bhimsen Joshi. I did not know she was there. I just did namaskar like this. When she saw me, she said, "Come here, come." I went, and she asked about my wife and all that.

Then, you know, it was June 2003, during the so-called sickness of Shri Mataji. So I suddenly said, "Mother, please get well," in Marathi. She said, "Oh, I am well." I said, "Then it's all right for me." Then she said a word in the kitchen. She said, "Tell yogis not to worry about my health. I'm working on something." This is a lesson which I learned, that whatever happens, as I told you, everything is planned. Every single thing is planned. If a president from a small country is going to another country, his bodyguards, his spies, everybody goes there to do the preparation work. So if Adi Shakti is coming on the earth, everything is taken care of.

How her chakras worked during a public program?

In Bombay, when we had these public programs, once she told me, "Just come and put your hand on my back." There was a public program going on. When I put my hand on her back, it was moving like a generator. At times, it was so difficult to put my hand because it was throwing it outside. I could feel her Agnya working so strongly. At that time we were not taking vibrations so much, so she wanted me to put my hand just to show that this is how Shri Mataji works during all public programs. All her chakras work. A lot of things are going on inside.

We were in this place in Delhi, and she had an earache. It was quite painful, and Shri Mataji was literally suffering. Rahul Bhai called me and another yogi in the afternoon. We used to put oil and fingers in the ears, but still, it was not working out. I was rather worried. At 6:30 we used to have a public program, and at 6:25 somebody said, "There are a lot of people coming." Shri Mataji, in five minutes, she just dressed up and came out. From 6:30 to 11:30, she gave the talk, everything, and not a single sign of pain. I was really surprised. I wondered if the pain went away, which I doubt, as it was rather heavy.

After a year or two, I had the opportunity to ask Shri Mataji. She said, "I remember that pain. It was there. But when I put my attention on Sahaja Yogis, when I don't put my attention on the pain, the pain does not exist for me." So when her attention is not on something, that thing doesn't exist.

Your first class?

First class also, it was the same thing. I was trying for my first class and I just missed it by some marks. At that time, I used to write a lot of letters to Shri Mataji at the Oxted, Surrey address. So I wrote to her that I just missed my first class. She just put her attention on what happened, and somehow, to make the story short, I got my first class. When she came here, she told us that when she got my letter, she just put her attention on it. And she told this story in a lot of villages to the villagers, how it happens.

Importance of putting letters on her feet.

It was in 1987, in Paris. At that time, she had put out a leader from Bombay. She said that he was using foul language. She told my father, "But why didn't you tell me that he was using bad language?" He said, "Yes, I used to tell you, Shri Mataji, but I used to write it and put it on your feet." Shri Mataji told me all this just to insist that when we have any problem, we should really put it on Shri Mataji's feet. She will take her time to solve it; don't insist that it should be solved immediately. But whatever we really feel, like for example, divisions in Sahaja Yoga, this and that, just put it on Shri Mataji's feet and forget about it.

Later on, I used to put letters on her feet and then bury them or put them in the river. Once I forgot and four years later, I found that letter. I had asked Shri Mataji that I should feel the joy in my meditation and I should not feel angry. I used to get angry very fast. And these two boons, she had given me in those four years. So from that time, I really do that.

So what do you do with the letters after?

I put them in the river, or you can bury them.

And how Shri Mataji saw many things in advance?

Like, for example, Sahaja marriages started in '78, which I told you. Even before that, for three or four years, she was talking about Sahaja marriages between Sahaja Yogis; she said she will get them married. And Ganpati Pule also, it started in December '85, but before that, for three or four years, Shri Mataji was talking about Ganpati Pule.

Just to tell you how she sees things in the future, like in the Diwali Puja of 2003, it's a small talk of five or ten minutes. Shri Mataji said, "Sahaja Yogis should not worry about their small little problems. Their destiny will work it out." Then she said, "When it will come, you'll remember that I've said it. I'm saying it now. But your destiny will work it out." So all these things, like jobs, this, that, all this is not your job. Your destiny will work it out.

Many things come into my head that Shri Mataji said. In the Diwali Puja of '85, Shri Mataji said, "Nobody can destroy Sahaja Yoga from outside, only from inside." This is something happening, especially here. At the Mahalakshmi Puja in '86, in Belgium, she told that all the money from the West will go, and the third world countries will get the money. Now you will see that China and India are having much more money than the West. All those small things, Shri Mataji has told, but she did not tell the time.

How she helped your worldly mother to pass away smoothly?

That was a very strong experience for me. My sister got married in '83. Myself and my father, we were on two buses with the foreigners. Shri Mataji said about my mother, "Take her home, don't take her with you because she has got some problems." This was in '83. In January '84, suddenly we got a message from the tour at night, and it said, "Shri Mataji wants Mr. and Mrs. Pai to join the tour immediately." So both of them went, and Shri Mataji told my mother, "You be on the tour, but never come physically in front of me."

Then, in February, we had the marriages and Shivaratri Puja in Bordi. Everybody was putting haldi on Shri Mataji's feet, and my mother also came because she wanted to put it. Shri Mataji was very, very angry with her, and my mother felt so bad. I said, "You see, last year she said not to go on the tour. This year she said go on the tour. There is some reason you don't know, I don't know."

Then, on March 21st, at the Bordi Puja, I went and asked Shri Mataji whether my parents could go to England because my sister was carrying a baby. Shri Mataji said immediately, "No, because your mother is sick." My mother was not sick. I asked again, "If my father can go alone?" Then Shri Mataji said, "Let her footsoak. At the moment, she is not footsoaking." It was true; she was very regular in footsoaking, but for 15-20 days she had not. Shri Mataji said, "She would like to see her granddaughter, so let her go."

On the 6th of April, for the first time, my mother could not sleep the whole night. She was breathing heavily. We didn't know what was happening. On Monday the 14th, the doctor said we should take her to the hospital for a heart x-ray. The x-ray showed she had some problem in the ventricles. He gave the right medicine, and in the evening, after about one and a half months, she ate something for the first time.

But at night, Shri Mataji came in her dream. She came as Lakshmi and told her, "You put everything on my lotus feet. Don't worry about your family, your husband, your children, nothing." My mother was so happy that Shri Mataji came like that. She told us on Wednesday. We thought in two or three days, she'll come back home. Tuesday night, again Shri Mataji came and said, "Do you remember what I told you last night?" She said, "Yes, I remember." Then on Wednesday night, my mother expired, on Thursday morning.

Shri Mataji sent us a beautiful letter to my father, saying that she had tried to warn us, she had tried to work on her so that everything goes on well. And she helped her to pass peacefully because when a person dies early in life, they have desires left behind. Shri Mataji prepared her. Sorry, I was a bit moved because I could literally see that. We were in the hospital trying to contact Shri Mataji, and she said in the letter, "Because you could not contact me, you couldn't know that nothing can be done and God's will has to be respected." I still have that letter.

And when your father passed away?

My father passed away in May '94. In February '94, he had made his will. In the will, he wrote that everything was to be given to Sahaja Yoga. He had lots of cassettes, photos, books, everything. He had a flat in Mumbai, the Urmila flat, and he said this flat has to be given to Sahaja Yoga. He had made an executor of the will. I took this will to Shri Mataji in Cabella at the Adi Shakti Puja in '94. Shri Mataji was reading this will, and I could literally see the tears coming out of her eyes. She was crying and she said, "He has given everything for Sahaja Yoga."

She said my father was very astute as far as money was concerned. After his retirement, he dedicated himself fully to Sahaja Yoga. He used to take the accounts of Sahaja Yoga and was sort of a right-hand man of Baba Mama, who was a chartered accountant. Shri Mataji said, "He would not give even a single penny to anybody who doesn't have the right will." She said, "So many people made money out of Sahaja Yoga. Very few people not only kept the money but raised it, and your father was one of them." It was a very big certificate for us.

She said that in February, my father could feel his death coming, and that's why he wrote the will. What happened was, till 1999, the flat was not transferred to Sahaja Yoga. The executor had not done anything. Shri Mataji was very angry with him, and she immediately changed him and made Hari Jalan, who was the leader of Bombay at that time, as the executor of the will. She wrote it on a paper and signed it; I still have that letter with me.

Later on, I could meet her, and Shri Mataji said she was very grateful because from 1970 to 1999, we did not have any official place for Sahaja Yoga that we could say was ours in Bombay. This flat was put into Sahaja Yoga in 1999 and was an official office, what Shri Mataji wanted. Recently, they wanted to sell this place to buy another one, but people opposed, and finally, they did not sell this place but bought another one. This place is still there. It's called Urmila.

I must have missed when you said Shri Mataji talked about your father taking birth again?

Yeah, yeah, I forgot. When I called her, it was a Monday. Afterwards, Shri Mataji took his Atma in her hand, and he said, "Physically, I'm tired now. Let me go. I will come back." She said he will come back between the Sahaja Yogis.

Thank you. Thank you so much.

Sorry, I was a bit moved because Shri Mataji literally brought me up. My mother passed away when I was 27. And later on, even before 2011 and after 2011, every single moment, she was there. Every single moment, every time. I don't have the words to thank you.

It's been absolutely amazing. Thank you so much.

Jai Shri Mataji.
