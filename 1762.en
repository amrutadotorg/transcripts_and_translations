Shri Ganesha Puja. Pune (India), 15 December 1991.

Today we are really sitting in very close relationship with the nature.
The whole thing, as you can see very clearly, is done by villagers and in a very simple way and I’m sure you must all be enjoy-ing it very much.
Today being the first puja in Maha-rastra, we have to do Ganesha Puja, but one has to understand how it is so impor-tant in Maharastra that people worship Ganesha. As you know there are … eight Ganeshas are there around this area and this triangle of Maharastra which has got on one side one big mountain. On the other side we have another mountain which, of course, is not in Maharastra. And also on top we have another moun-tain. So like a triangle which is made like a Mooladhara means the Kundalini itself.
So the Ku ndalini of the whole world resides in this area. That’s why it is called, we should say, as Maharastra, as the country which is very great, the nation which is very great. But I don’t know how far Maharastrans realize that they are sitting in the land of Maharastra.
This land which is vibrated by Shri Ganesha has its own simplicity, has its own vibrations, a different style, a differ-ent type. The best part of Maharastra is that it gives you a very good attention. With Ganesha so much vibrating, the attention becomes very concentrated and this concentration helps you in so many ways and that is why it is said that Ganesha was created to spread or to emit auspiciousness and holiness. Actually, if there is holiness there is auspiciousness. For Ganesha is t he one actually who cleanses everything, cleanses everything because it is innocence and the innocence that cleanses you takes away all kinds of conditionings and egos that are distracting your attention.
So the attention which is so wobbly otherwise in other places can settle down very well in Maharastra because of Shri Ganesha’s blessings that this country has, that people have very good attention. With that good attention you can really do so many things like now, for example, you can see the software. Good mathematics. They’re very good at music because all these things require tremendous attention. Art, dancing, anything which requires tremendous attention, that has to come only through Ganesha. Because they say Ganesha is a giver of wisdom. He’s a giver of wisdom. Means just His wisdom becomes just a dharma, becomes a part and parcel of your being. You become just wise. Now somebody may ask, ÒMother how to become wise. It’s very difficult to say how to become wise. It is just that it happens that you become wise. So, though He’s a child, He’s so matured. He’s so wise. And He’s not only that, but He emits wisdom and this wisdom is an in-nate quality of anyone who is a Sahaja Yogi because in him, also, Shri Ganesha has been awakened.
So he becomes a wise person, very wise, and with wisdom what does he achieve? He achieves a balance, a proper ascent and also he understands that this ascent is for his benevolence, for the benevolence of his country, benevolence of the whole world. He understands the importance of Sahaja Yoga. Without this wisdom, one cannot understand. And this wisdom is within us, just absolutely, in-nately built in. Only thing is we have to use the storehouse of this wisdom that is within us.

Of course, with Sahaja Yoga, it starts emitting and you start feeling and you start understanding what this wisdom is. You give up all your stupid, childish things. You give up all your attachments. You give up many of your, say, things that you don’t like which doesn’t behove you. You feel that you should give up, but you cannot. But, with Sahaja Yoga, it just hap-pens automatically and you just see in your light what is needed, what is not needed. In that wisdom you throw away whatever is wrong.
So that a great work this Ganesha has to do within ourselves. This manifes-tation of Ganesha within us is very important, I think, not that it is only the blessings, but also the foundation stone of spiritual life is Shri Ganesha. That’s why IÔve been very anxious that we should find out proper schools for our children. They should have proper education and t Ëhey should be looked after because their Ganesh Tattwa is already there. Only thing we have to nourish it, we have to look after it and make it grow. Once that happens then children are safe. Then nothing, nothing can harm them. Nothing they will absorb which is wrong. They will never be again in the wrong path. But if from early childhood, you did not have this kind of training or this kind of understanding about Kundalini or about wisdom part of it, you can never, later on, easily assimilate it. For that, you really require a great effort and understanding that you have to have this. It’s so beauti-ful. You must get this attention and you must get this innocence within. With Sahaja Yoga, as you see, it’s working out very fast and people are getting, really, very wise and I can see the wisdom writ large on their faces.
In this wisdom what do we find here? You see, on any line that we move, we can find that most of our problems are coming from human beings because ecological problem, or any problem we think of, comes from human beings. Or other programs that you have in your own country, as you have seen, that they are such problems that it’s sort of endless and they cannot change them. You feel very nice sitting underneath this because you are fed up … that you have and the prob-lems that it causes to you and the way it is now becoming very artificial.
But in these circumstances, one has to understand that the… wisdom plays such a part in life that whatever may happen outside, whatever may be the trend, whatever may be the fashion, whatever maybe the people are all changing into, you do not change. You change within. Once you are changed within, then you have full idea as to what is expected o f others, what they should do, what you are doing and how to deal with them and how to talk to them, how to tell them, how far to go with them – everything. All this comes through wisdom.
In Sahaja Yoga, as you know, you are very capable people, you have achieved a lot, you know everything, you know all about chakras. You know practically everything. I don’t have to tell you anything. Despite all that, one should have also the wisdom how to deal with others, how to talk to others, how to behave towards others, how not to control anyone, not to say something that would be rather harsh or hurting. Because, if you are trying to spread Sahaja Yoga, this is the only way we can go forward, is to look after everyone with great compassion.
Now, we might think that wisdom is there with us and we know how to do so many things with our wisdom and now we are absolutely wise. Agree, with Sahaja Yogis, now they have become really very, very wise and they know how to use their wisdom.
But still, faith in themselves really has to be of the Nirvikalpa state. That is only possible also through Shri Ganesha because He is in Nirvikalpa. He has Nirvikalpas, nothing. He doesn’t have to question anything. He doesn’t have to ask for anything. He is just there. And He’s in complete Nirvikalpa. Complete, absolutely into a state where He is not at all attached, nor is He worrying about things, nothing of the kind. He is just in Nirvikalpa and in that Nirvikalpa He worships Mother.
Small, small stories can show He how you were so sure of Hims }elf, how He had courage and how He worked out everything so intelligently. But when you are doing something, you can be in two minds. You can be not so decisive, but He was and He is, always very decisive that He knows what is to be done like the – this is the point.
So, in wisdom you don’t have to think, argue. I’ve seen many people who say, Mother, you see, we were thinking, then we had vibrations. We didn’t know what to do, this, that, how to do, how to correct, how to work it out. Now, I must say this is a state. It is not a state to be achieved, but it’s a state. Means you are there. It has to be innately built in yourself, this state of wisdom. But you can also work it out by just concentrating on yourself and trying to find out Òwhat’s the matter with me, what happens, why, why is it I’m like this. The introspection can help you a lot to be extremely wise, but Ø easier method is to worship the principle of innocence within yourself.
For example now, we are dealing with, supposing, somebody who is a thief, say. He’s a thief now. What should you do with a thief. After you have found out whatever was lost, the material you had, after that, what are you to do is just to forget about it completely. Once it has happened, then you have to just forget, not to worry about it too much, Oh, this has happened, that has happened and how to make this point all right and this gentleman is not all right. This, that. Just forget it.
So the wisdom is also in forgiving. That why Christ talked about forgiveness? Just forgive. There’s no sense in remembering. This person said so, this person did so, that happened so. Just forget it and once you start forgetting all these things, you know, you’ll remember right things and useless things you’ll just forget.
You don’t remember who has insulted you, who has troubled you, who has be íen misbehaving. I don’t even think about people who have gone out of Sahaja Yoga, talking ill about Me, saying things, this, that. It’s all right. Let them say whatever they like, I am not bothered.
But what bothers Me more, that if they do like this, I don’t know what will happen to them. That’s the only wisdom part of it, that, you see, when I forgive everyone I … forgive. I have nothing to say.
But then also a thought comes in, that if they’re doing like this, then what’s going to happen to them. They’re doing this to some one who’s so good, who’s so religious, so highly placed in spiritual life. Then you can’t play about but somebody’s playing, then what you have to do is to really forgive because one thing is built-in in Sahaja Yoga that who tries to trouble you they will be trouble also.
So try to forgive at least, at least you soothe them down. All right, I forgive you. So soothe them done. Like this kind of a wisdom you should have, not to get after people, únot to pester some one, not to be very strict, not to be very sort of – I should say – pursue the matter. Whatever is it, that point you should finish off and just don’t worry.
I was telling just now that there is a servant, supposing. Now, he steals your money, all the time. You know he steals your money. Now what to do if he’s stealing your money? One thing is to get out, to ask him to get out. Then you have another one. Then again you get him out and get another one. Go on like that because they’re poor people….
Now even if you’re careful, still they might steal, so what you should do is just to forgive the person and put the money in such a place that he cannot reach. Finished. As simple as this. You should just find out what doe s he steal. Oh, that’s all. Then you keep it one side.
But don’t worry about all the time that, Now, how am I to save myself from this thief or how am I to punish him? Just don’t think. These incidents are just like a breeze coming any way. These relationships are just like that. There’s no depth in it. They’re not going to bring any kind of unhappiness or happiness, whatever it is, if you go on lingering about them.
So, the first thing is live in the present. The wisdom is in living in the present. Present, we are here, so forget the past. Now, if I say forget the past, then they say, How to do it? How to forget the past. Again, I would say, meditation is the only way. You give up your left and you give up your right and you are just standing in th e centre, enjoying the wisdom, enjoying the joy of your being.
So, the best part of our lives is spent in bothering, in getting upset, in getting worried, getting after some one. Where is the time? Just think like that. Now supposing some one says something to Me and then others will say, Mother, you must do something about it. You must punish that person. Where is the time? We have to awaken the kundalini of thousands and thousands and thousands and here we are just worried about something nonsensical.
So our wisdom is finished. We have no wisdom at all. Even at the highest level you can see people don’t have wisdom. Highest level of realization I’ve seen people who do not have wisdom in the sense that they want to run away, they just get fed up, take sanyasa, finished, go to Himalayas, live there happily. There’s no wisdom in that also.
So living in the present you don’t also feel tired because you don’t think of the past and the future and you live very well and in great happiness, you improve things and you don’t think of the future, what is going to happen to me or anything and that’s how you save lot of troubles of others, as well as yours.
So this wisdom is to live in the present, is now that you ask somebody, How are you? All right. And he’s not in the present. You ask somebody, Are you enjoying yourself? Not in the present. You ask somebody, Are you happy? No. Then you are not in the present. You ask some one that, Are you hungry? Maybe, may not be. Maybe they don’t know even in the present if they are hungry or not.
It’s so much that they’re lost in the past and in the future, that’s the sign of unwise behavior, unwise line. If they don’t know whether they’d like to have their food or not. But those who are really in the present forget all these small, small things. They’re just in the present and in the present whatever they have to do, they just do it.
This is a very good practice. One has to to practice wisdom through living in the present. Just say, What am I to do right now? What am I to do. Like you’re getting out of the house. Many people leave half way – Oh, my God, I have left my passport. They’ll go back. Then again, some time they will come out. My God, I have left my spectacles. Again go back. Then again they will come back and say, I have lost this. I should have this. These kind of people are very, very common. So at that style when you are leaving the house, say, at that time, if you’re in the present, then you just think, What have I to take? Just say, One, two, three, four, five. Yes, this is is what I have to take and this there. That’s how you can really establish yourself in wisdom, itself, means the wisdom acts by itself. It’s a power. Wisdom is a very big power. If you are a wise person, it’s a power. It can combat any kind of ignorance, any kind of attacks, any kind of stupidity. It’s such a tremendous power that one has given us that we are wise and this wisdom you should try to really, to develop it and mature it properly within ourselves.
So today’s Shri Ganesha’s Puja is there. Now you should ask for wisdom and for that we have to be in the present. Every way we should be in the present. If you can try, you can be because your kundalini has been awakened and you can be all the time in the present, but today you should first try and get the kundalini established in the present.

May God bless you.
