Before I met Shri Mataji, I was a student, and John and I were going to a yoga class. I had just decided I wanted to get fit, so we went to a Hatha yoga class. The girl who was running the class had seen a poster of Shri Mataji. She knew something about her and said, "I've heard of this lady. I've heard she's very good. Would you like to come along?" So we said, "Yeah, all right then." We went along not knowing anything about what we were going to, just because this girl had said she was very good.

We went to Dr. Johnson House in Birmingham, and it was 1978. No, we weren't married then; we were going out with each other. We went and sat down, and there were probably about 30 people in the room. Shri Mataji started talking, and I thought, "Well, I really like what this lady's saying. She seems very, very genuine." She struck a chord in me.

Then she gave realisation. I can't exactly remember what she did, but I remember she came down and worked on every single person in the room. She came to me and said, "You must say the Lord's Prayer three times to yourself." Then she moved on and worked on somebody else. After a while, she came back to me, put her hand above my head, and said, "Ah, you've got it."

I sort of looked at her and thought, "Well, what have I got?" because I couldn't feel anything. I didn't feel a cool breeze, I didn't feel vibrations, I didn't feel different, I didn't even feel thoughtless. So I thought, "Well, it all sounds very nice, but obviously it's not for me." I thought it was a shame.

Then we got to the end of the meeting, and it might have been Bala who said to everybody, "Would you like to come up and kiss Shri Mataji's feet?" So we all got up, stood in a line, and went and kissed Shri Mataji's feet. I didn't think anything of it; I just thought, "Okay, then." I think I remember her putting a hand on my back when she did that.

I went home not feeling anything. I didn't feel vibrations at all. But I went to bed, and when I woke up the next morning, I went out to get a paper. I remember walking along the street feeling completely different. I remember thinking, "I feel slightly drunk." I was walking along feeling very light-headed and thinking, "Well, something must have happened last night. I must have gotten something."

John had asked the person organizing the meeting if we could see Shri Mataji again, and he said, "Yes, you can come to my house." It was Bala, and he was living in Tamworth at the time. So we both went that day, the Sunday after we got our realisation, to Bala's house. We walked into the living room of a little semi-detached house, and there were a few people there, probably 15 or 20.

I remember seeing a couple of armchairs. Obviously, one chair was set up for Shri Mataji to sit in, and there was one next to it. I said, "Is anybody sitting in that one?" and they said, "No." So I went and sat in it. It's a little embarrassing now. I sat in it and put my feet up. Shri Mataji came in and sat in her chair, and she turned to me. I was right next to her like this.

She said, "Can you feel the vibrations? Put your hands up. Can you feel the vibrations?"

I said, "No."

She said, "Put your hand above your head. Can you feel the vibrations now?"

I said, "No." And she just laughed and went on to the next person. She should have been feeling something, but I wasn't.

I can't remember a lot about that meeting, but I do remember Shri Mataji addressed everybody in the room. They were all sitting on the floor. She said to one girl who was just sitting there, "You must forgive your father." This girl just burst into tears. I think she said something like, "You have to respect your parents. You may not like them, but you have to respect them." And so that was that. That was the end of that experience for me.
