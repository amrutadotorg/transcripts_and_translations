I'm very interested in your generation and the blessing you experienced of living alongside the Goddess as the Mother. It's quite an alien experience to us, having God mothering you, cooking for you, and looking after you. I think later generations would be fascinated to hear what that was like. Do any of you have any particular experiences where it dawned on you that this was God in a special way that you didn't even realize when you had your Self-Realization?

I've got one. It was when Mother was at Ashley Gardens. She used to work on me an enormous amount. At one point, she said to somebody else, not me, that I was the worst damaged person she'd ever met. Somebody else said I had half of one chakra working still. I mean, I was really seriously gone. But Mother, in her infinite compassion, used to have me around and work on me. I remember she used to sit with her foot on my back while she'd be on the phone or reading a paper, moving her foot around.

Anyway, I was sitting on the floor, and she was on her sofa. Behind her was the window. I remember thinking, "Mother, here you are, you're looking beautiful, and behind you is the sky, and the sky is actually infinite; it goes on forever." She picked up my thought, looked at me, and said, "Yes. What you see is Mataji, but what is behind is vast." That's the story.

Anybody else? What about particular experiences about her as the Mother—giving you advice or doing something for you that touched you in an unexpected way?

My legal situation was a little bit unstable because of visas and so on. Each time Shri Mataji saw me, she used to kiss me or hug me. I just took it for granted. I was so heartbroken when it stopped because, after a while, I had to be a grown-up girl and not need Mother's attention and love so much. But it was quite extraordinary because I felt I had really found my real Mother. It was a very, very personal feeling. I just needed it very badly, and Mother somehow knew that.

Mother used to cook for us. She used to do everything for us, really. When we went to Stonehenge, she bought us all ice creams. We traveled with her in the back of her car. We went to public programs in the back of her car. It was such a normal thing to do. She used to be so, so sweet. You felt that she knew exactly what you were feeling, what you were thinking. She would respond to you on a different level. You just knew that she was like your mother—the best mother you could ever have, who knew exactly what you wanted and what you needed. It was an ideal. For me, it was very moving because I never had this when I was growing up. It was such a new experience. I really felt like I was reliving my childhood again and being looked after in many ways.

(Another speaker begins)

Yes, she'd be spoiling us all the time. She was more like my mother than my mother. I remember many times calling her "Mum" by mistake. But she'd know how to touch your heart. Just the way she'd say your name would spark something in you and melt your heart. You can't really put it into words, but that love was there very strongly. And I feel that we all really needed that.

(The interviewer speaks)

You and Derek must have quite a lot of stories from building various houses in various parts of the universe. The ones I've heard have been hilarious. Derek, maybe you've got one that you remember?

Yes. This was in '98, in Cabella. Somebody wanted to be in charge, but Shri Mataji had said to him, "You should just do carpentry." He'd taken it badly and disappeared. So the next morning, I had to go and see Shri Mataji. I walked up the stairs, and I knew what was going to happen. I had an old photograph of how the house was. I walked up the stairs, and she was sitting outside her room, in between the two double doors. The big doors towards the fountain were closed.

I walked up, and Shri Mataji's face was completely drained. For two weeks, all her windows were boarded up with plastic; she couldn't see any light. She said, "You see that angel up on the wall there?" There were some plaster mouldings being put up. And she said, "John put that there. And I can see the love pouring off of this." It was a statue. I was looking, and I couldn't see anything pouring off, but she was saying there was all this love pouring from this particular angel.

Then she said to me, "See the scaffold outside? The scaffold has to come down, or something's going to happen." Immediately, I thought, "Oh my God." It was like I just imagined the apocalypse. The whole of creation is going to be destroyed. It was like being in a movie: you see something all beautiful, and then suddenly, there's going to be a disaster. When she's talking about the Ganas or the deities, she always says "they." So she said, "They say you have to do the job." And I'm thinking, "Oh my God, the whole of everything rested on my shoulders." She said, "This scaffold has to come down. I want you to do this for me." And I was like, "Yes, Your Majesty."

It was like time stood still. But then I realized, I had a photograph in my pocket. The way the people were designing it was all wrong, which I knew. So I took the photograph out and said, "Your Majesty, I think if we redesign this plan this way, it will work better." She said, "Yeah, go ahead. No problem." So I put the photograph back in my pocket and thought, "Wow, this is something which has got to be accomplished."

In the end, everything worked out. But I was just thinking of how those two things happened at the same time, within a few seconds. After it was all resolved, people were ringing up from all over the world, saying, "Fergie, what's going on? Something's happened at the castle." I said, "What do you mean?" They said, "Yeah, tell us, there's something going on," because the yogis are quite sensitive. I was trying to fob them off. They said, "Well, nothing." "No, no, tell us." I explained the story of what happened, and they were saying, "Oh, wow." Something had happened, which was part of history.
