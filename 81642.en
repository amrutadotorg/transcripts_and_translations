Jai Shri Mataji, Maureen. Jai Shri Mataji, hi. Thank you for joining us for this interview about your memorable times with Shri Adi Shakti, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi herself, especially as we get closer to the times of Navaratri, as we worship the goddess in her form as Shri Durga. And especially your memory with Shri Mataji in the Himalayas. One of the nights and one of the forms of Shri Mataji that we worship is Shri Shaila Putri, which is the daughter of the mountains.

Shankarji and I had the privilege and the blessing to be at her school in the Himalayas in Dharamshala that she set up for these children. It was just such a special place to be in the collective, to meditate whenever we could. It's a very special place, but we would like to know from both of you what it was like in those times. So if you could start, Maureen.

Maureen: Okay, so we went there in December 1970...

Pat: Yeah, over the year. So it's '76 into '77, wasn't it?

Maureen: Yes, but we went in January.

Pat: In January, yes. Oh, just after Christmas.

Maureen: Yes, so it was the beginning of January. We came into Mumbai first, and then we went to Delhi. Well, then we went into the villages. Then we went to Delhi, and from there we went to Nepal, wasn't it, Pat?

Pat: Yeah. So we'd done a lot. We were there for three months, and we were back in Mumbai for Mother's birthday. So it was between February and early March, possibly.

Maureen: Probably early March, yes. We got a train, didn't we?

Pat: We did. And then a coach, a bus.

Maureen: No, that was coming back. Oh, yes. So we got a train there. We got a train to Patna.

Interviewer: So this wasn't your first trip to India, was it?

Pat: Yes, it was.

Interviewer: Could you tell us what it was like from when you boarded the plane at Heathrow, both individually and vibrationally?

Pat: Well, it was all unknown. I got a terrible cold on the plane from nowhere, and I spent the whole journey sneezing and trying to find bits of tissue paper to sneeze into. So it wasn't exactly very awe-inspiring.

Maureen: It was all new, wasn't it? We had no idea what to expect. I'd certainly never flown, and I don't think you had either. It was an 11-hour journey, I believe. We were just so excited. I know Pat had his cold, but it was incredible.

At one point, Mother had said we were going to go to India, so we saved up. Then when she came back, she said we weren't in any state to go, so it all got cancelled. And then it all got put back on again. Mother had actually asked the girls to make special clothes. We had long skirts so that we were respectable because certainly, I was coming from a happy, hippie background. I remember making this skirt, and it was so hot when I got there. We were dressed up to the nines.

When we arrived, it was about three in the morning. I can just remember my hands hurting because I could feel all my catches so badly.

Pat: I remember they greeted us with garlands.

Maureen: They did, yes. And we were so embarrassed. We all got in the car, and as the car set off, the Indian yogis surreptitiously wound down the windows and stuck their hands out. I think they could feel our catches.

Pat: Well, when they put our luggage in the boot, I got hit on the head, and they just asked which bit of my head. They said something like, "Very good clearing out."

Maureen: And then the first place we went to was where Mother was. I think the next day, we set off for Rahuri and all that, didn't we?

Pat: Yeah. Well, we went down to the beach that night.

Maureen: So we were all very jet-lagged, but that day, we went to the beach at Mumbai, and I think we were bought Kulfi ice cream. We were told that you don't actually go into the sea; you just respect the sea. We were just learning so much. We had no idea what we were doing. I think that would sum us up, wouldn't you, Pat?

Pat: Oh yeah, we didn't have a clue. We were absolutely clueless. And the poor Sahaja Yogis, as you said, I think they were a bit astonished. There were six of us on that flight.

Maureen: Then we did all kinds of things in India. After Rahuri and places like that, we also went to Shirdi with the Sahaja Yogis.

Pat: Yes, we did. And when we got there, Mother was horrified at the vibrations. She was hitting her head. She went to the back of the temple, and she was banging her head against the wall. She said it just wouldn't clear. One of the yogis put his hand between the wall and her head so Mother wouldn't hurt herself.

Maureen: And do you remember, I got stuck in the ladies' section in the temple? The next thing I knew, there were all these ladies twirling around doing some kind of dance, and I was stuck. It was a bit embarrassing.

Pat: And then Mother sent us off over land to Allura and Ajanta.

Maureen: And we also went to the Taj Mahal on the way, didn't we?

Pat: Yeah. And I got really ill at Allura and Ajanta.

Maureen: Yeah, you did. You missed it.

Pat: I got as far as the beginning, couldn't go any further, and had to go back.

Maureen: We had to stay in the hotel room while the others went and looked at everything. But then we got to Delhi, and there were programs, and we spent quite a lot of time shopping for some reason. At some stage, we set off for Nepal. We got a train. I remember lying on the beds that pull down on the train, and I could feel the catches on my toes of people when they walked past. That was quite interesting.

Then we got up early in the morning and got giant clay pots full of tea from somebody who was selling them.

Pat: And we went to Patna and went into the Ganges.

Maureen: Oh, yes. First, we went to Banaras, didn't we? I think we were in a car going to Banaras. And then we got in a boat and we went right into the river and submerged ourselves.

Pat: That's right. Much to the shock of the guy with the boat.

Maureen: Then we got a plane from Patna to Kathmandu. I think Mother came a day or so later. Anyway, we met Gregoire, and we all went and hung out at his place. And that's where Mother caught nits from me. She was combing them out of her hair and taking the nits to destroy them. That might be one of the photos I've got of Mother combing her hair.

Pat: Yes, absolutely. It's her combing the nits out of her hair. Oh dear.

Interviewer: I'm going to share some photos on email. And so I'll share it here, and maybe that will also enable some more memories. So let's see here, for example... So where are we here?

Pat: Well, somewhere in Nepal. The hat is very typically Nepalese on this child she's wearing.

Interviewer: And is this somewhere where you lived in Gregoire's house?

Maureen: Well, there are one or two pictures in the garden. This is me in the white and blue sari next to Shri Mataji. And then it's Douglas.

Pat: That's Douglas. And that's me in the white kurta pyjama, probably. Or it might be Tony. And Gregoire is on Mother's left, obviously.

Interviewer: And this one?

Pat: That was when we were leaving Kathmandu. I took that out of the bus window. And that was in Pokhara.

Maureen: Pokhara, yes. In these hollowed-out canoe things. Just a log that was hollowed out. Very, very dodgy.

Pat: That was out the plane window at the Himalayas. That was the little sightseeing plane. We flew backwards and forwards in front of the Himalayas.

Interviewer: What was it like vibrationally for you guys?

Maureen: Amazing. I mean, the Himalayas were so magical. The whole time, I kept feeling that they were like the moon somehow, reflecting moonlight. That was my feeling.

Pat: Although on this particular trip, I spent most of the time sulking because our side of the plane flew on the opposite side to the Himalayas. On the way back, it flew much further away, so it wasn't as close. But we got a long strip photograph, and Shri Mataji signed them, didn't she?

Maureen: We got a certificate, which I've still got somewhere. And Maureen actually went up to the pilots in the cockpit and asked them if I could come and look.

Pat: To see properly, because I was so upset and angry that I refused.

Interviewer: So what was this certificate about?

Pat: Oh, just that... they gave it to all the sightseers who'd been on the plane trip, to certify they'd seen the Himalayas. But Mother signed mine to certify that I'd been to the Himalayas because I was still upset.

Maureen: I found the certificate! [Holds it up to the camera]

Interviewer: Amazing! She wrote, "Mr. Patrick." Wow. Thanks for sharing that, Pat.

Interviewer: This is definitely Nepal. Where is this? Do you know?

Maureen: Yes, we're all shopping. That's Tony and Jane on the left. That's me and Gavin in front of me. And you can see Mother there.

Pat: What Mother used to do was she used to go into the shops first and ask what all the prices were and then come out and wave at us to come and tell us. She said we'd be cheated because they thought we were foreigners. But we were still cheated because we were hopeless at bargaining. They'd tell us a price and we'd go, "Oh, that's nice."

Maureen: "Don't do that! You have to say no, no, no."

Interviewer: And where is this now? We've got a bull.

Pat: This is also Kathmandu. Gavin tried not to look scared as this bull was eyeing him in the street. We were walking very slowly out of the way.

Maureen: This was up in the hills when we went on a picnic. We went to see some holy guy. And that's when Shri Mataji's purse went missing. She was least bothered, but Gregoire was absolutely trying to get it all sorted out. We just watched all these people going up and down the mountain. You could follow them. All the locals set off to try and find this purse. They went into a house at the other end, and a few people had joined the posse. At each house, the line got longer until they eventually arrived somewhere, found the purse, and brought it back.

Pat: And then Mother lined up all the kids. I think she gave some money to the people that brought it back, but then she lined up all the kids—there were a lot of little kids there—and she gave each kid realisation. Then she gave them one rupee. And someone amongst us who shall be nameless said, "Shri Mataji, you cannot pay people to give them their realisation." And Mother said, "I'm the Adi Shakti. I can do anything I like."

Interviewer: Amazing. Okay. Where are we here?

Pat: I think we're back in Kathmandu. Incidentally, that guy in the picture before was Gregoire's long-suffering servant, Tej. Remember Tej? He had quite a sense of humour. When we arrived at the place where this hermit was, he looked like a traditional hermit, with his hair done up in a top knot and everything. When we announced Adi Shakti to him, he started singing songs. And the next thing we knew, Mother was behind him with her feet on his back, talking to him, and he was talking back to Mother.

Maureen: Mother said he was crazy because he'd been driven mad by the Kali Yuga.

Interviewer: Where is this then? It's a lovely skirt and a lovely blouse.

Maureen: That was actually a skirt Shri Mataji gave me and the waistcoat Shri Mataji gave me. It's a red velvet. She gave me a lot of her clothes, and that waistcoat was hers. The skirt was a batik sort of thing that she gave me that wasn't hers but was something that she'd picked up on her travels. So yes, she gave a lot of things. Very, very lucky.

Interviewer: Having a picnic with Shri Mataji there... what did you guys have for a start? Because there aren't sandwiches so easily made in Nepal.

Maureen: No. Gregoire's long-suffering servant, Tej, would have made them. It would have been something like chapatis and things, I believe. Parathas, I would imagine. Shri Mataji used to cook for us so much as well.

Pat: Oh yeah, she did.

Maureen: I can't remember if she cooked in Nepal, probably not because Tej was there, but certainly in England, she did. As one of the girls, I would stand around supposedly helping, but not having a clue what to do. Mother used to make the most amazing dal, putting in so much butter. I mean, butter and butter and butter... it was like three inches floating on the top. Absolutely beautiful.

It was like Mother would do things just to take our minds off ourselves so that we'd become absorbed in what she was doing, whether it was watching a TV program or her cooking. Quite often, in the middle of it, she'd just go, "Ha!" and she'd cleared us out of something that we'd let go of because our attention was no longer inwards on our problems. She'd released it.

Do you remember, Pat, when we were watching that Bette Davis film one evening? We somehow got thrilled with the film without really meaning to because we were sat with Mother. And then she said, because our attention was no longer stuck on our problems, she was able to clear whatever it was that we were stuck on previously. The negative things were so entwined with us that she couldn't pull it out, or it would hurt us.

Pat: She tried to do that with me once. I can't remember where it was, might have been Bordi. She was trying to get this bhoot out, and I started to faint. Everything went all yellow and then white, and I had to sort of fall down a bit. Mother said that I couldn't bear it. She couldn't get it out; it would have to come later.

Maureen: Do you remember that time in Mumbai when we went to dinner with somebody posh?

Pat: Yes, I do. We got Coca-Cola.

Maureen: Mother was talking about something, and it was going on and on. At some point, I suddenly realized she was going around and around this point where she was saying, "You just have to stop thinking." And then I just stopped thinking. Then I was just watching. And then someone else did as well. Then someone else, and it just ended up with one last person asking questions while we were all just staring. I remember we all just went silent until, in the end, that person did too. It was amazing. She was endlessly patient with us.

Pat: It was in Nepal, actually, that Mother said we had to be "foundation stones." She said, "You may not be seen because you'll be in the ground under the temple. But," she said, "there'll be some pretty flowers coming along later on. But the foundations are important."

Interviewer: Now when you look at it, we are in the heart of the universe, and you went from England, the heart of the universe, to India and to the Sahasrara of the universe, which is the Himalayas, which Shri Mataji has said gives vibrations to the entire universe.

Pat: It was just like a, almost dreamlike, wasn't it? After the first two or three weeks, it just seemed like you were in this amazing dream that would just go on forever. It was fabulous.

Maureen: The whole time. But somehow we sort of took it for granted in a way. I think we'd been elevated to a place where it became normal to be with the Adi Shakti all the time. You'd be pulled out from the crowd because Mother would say, "Where are the foreigners?" and we'd be hauled in front of her from the back where we were trying to hide.

Pat: Well, we weren't just hiding. We thought we wanted to give the locals a chance to...

Maureen: Exactly. That's what I meant. We were beginning to know what state we were in, and the last thing we wanted was to be center stage. But Mother was so concerned for us and looked after us constantly. We very often went in the car with her, whereas everybody else had to make their own way. In fact, Nepal was sort of halfway through the India tour for us, and for that week, we went back to being just with Mother.

We did do Ajwan there with Mother. Do you remember?

Pat: Oh, that was the first time. Yes.

Maureen: She put her head under a stool. She got her own shawl, and we all had to go underneath her shawl with Mother to inhale the Ajwan. So it was camp for the divine. After that, she said, "You must cover your head after doing Ajwan and go to bed. You should never do it and then go out."

Interviewer: What about the other days that you were there with her?

Pat: It's hard to remember really.

Maureen: It really is. I mean, generally with Mother, it was always being taught things. Mostly we used to ask her questions, and she'd just talk about all kinds of things.

I can remember being told off and how I learned that you don't criticize each other in Sahaja Yoga. It's such a basic, simple thing. But I'd said something about Gregoire, and Mother, in private, told me that's not what you do. That went in so deep. All the criticizing of each other that we hear about now... she said, "It doesn't matter what they do. That's not the point." You have to be very careful.

Interviewer: Thanks for sharing that, Maureen, because at this juncture, it is very important to be reminded of that.

Maureen: I mean, there have been times when Mother's told us to speak up about things, but it was a particular way of doing it. It's how it's done and what your intentions are. I think that's what I took from it. What was your intention? Were you just trying to be a bit clever, or were you honestly concerned about something? And I certainly wasn't. I was a bit clever, I think. A bit young.

Interviewer: What about the food with Shri Mataji there? I guess because you were in vibrations at an elevation, it didn't quite matter. Was that the case?

Maureen: Well, certainly for me. When we first came to Sahaja Yoga, Pat and I, eating was our one pastime we could do and know that it wasn't going to harm us, unlike all the other things we'd done before. So we were quite fond of food. I can remember, not so much in Nepal, but it happened quite a lot that when we were with Mother, I had no appetite, no interest in food. And then afterwards, it would all come back. I'd think, "Oh, there was all that lovely food and I wasn't interested." So that's how I can remember that my interest wasn't taken up with the food when she was there. Things for me, anyway, they sort of dwindled in importance completely.

Pat: Yes, a different dimension altogether.

Maureen: We were very blessed, obviously, because in sleeping quarters, we were always near Mother as the ladies. She paid particular attention and made sure that we were always looked after. But somehow she was... we were like little children. So there was no difference between the females and the males in a weird sort of way.

There were so many extraordinary things. Like when Mother was telling you about Christ in Oxted.

Pat: Oh yes. Mother would... we'd been to a meeting in Cambridge, and Mother took me back with her to her house in Oxted. Just herself and I. We were sitting there, and I was on the floor, and she started talking about Christ. And I realized I was with Mary. I became absolutely overwhelmed. Mother noticed that it had had this profound effect on me, and it was like she drew the curtain again and brought it back to her and me in a sitting room in Oxted because the realization was just too much.

I later realized that's how she had to be with us a lot because we couldn't literally take her in her real form. When I first met her, I saw that she was a goddess. That was my first feeling. I'd never thought that before. But then later on, she managed to become human for us so that we could interact with her. Otherwise, you literally couldn't do anything.

Maureen: I remember walking into a place we had in Gower Street and Mother was cooking. I looked into the room, and she looked like a kind of magical genie that was floating a few inches off the ground. Not that she was, but it looked like that somehow. It just looked completely unearthly and extraordinary. Another time, I was with her in Oxted, and she was talking about something and she started playing with her hands like this. I could see this ball of energy that she was just playing with. Extraordinary.

Pat: You know, the way it used to feel to me, whenever Mother came into a room, I felt as if I was in a doll's house and Mother was this giant being looking into the doll's house through a window.

Maureen: I can remember going to her place in Victoria. We were waiting to take the lift, and the lift came down and Shri Mataji was there. It's the first time I'd ever realized that Mother was shorter than me because she always seemed so immense. I was looking down at her and had never realized that before because she always seemed like an immense personality, and size was irrelevant.

Pat: Every room she was in always seemed two or three times as big as normal. You remember when we went back to Icehouse Wood and we couldn't believe how small the house looked? It felt like a palace when we were there with Mother.

Interviewer: Shri Mataji mentioned at a puja how there were sages meditating in the mountains who absorbed all her vibrations. From then to now, what has been the sort of vibrational changes for you both in your capacity to absorb the vibrations? Any tips that you could give to the yogis now?

Maureen: I would say more silent meditation.

Pat: Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. To me, we were so damaged that it took such a long time to get to a place where you even could recognize the damage. There are times, obviously, when you get completely elevated. It's when you can let go of all the stuff that is around.

The first time I had some really amazing experiences, before that, I'd felt the lowest I've ever felt. This was quite some years after I'd been in Sahaja Yoga. I was just going through such heavy stuff, and I thought I'd never get through it. I felt that I was literally sliding into hell. I thought, "Oh, well, I suppose I'll just witness what hell's like." I just couldn't fight anymore. And the next day, I went into this incredible blissful state that lasted for weeks. So, you just don't know. Anything could happen to you in the next moment, spontaneously. All my deepest experiences have been when I least expected them.

Maureen: I remember that the times with Shri Mataji before we started doing public programs were particularly special and amazing. When we started getting all these new seekers coming in suddenly to the collective in London, the vibrations got heavier and heavier. Although we were really thrilled to meet other seekers, vibration-wise, it got very heavy. There was a long period when you just felt like you were struggling through mud. Working on people would completely slay you.

We'd go back and see Mother after each program at Caxton Hall, and I can remember her having to clear us out. I'd been working on some people who'd been to a false guru, thinking, "Oh, great, they're going to get it." And I'd be absolutely destroyed because we weren't very strong and because of our own weaknesses.

Pat: I remember when we went to the first Mind and Body Exhibition in London. We staggered back from that, and Mother was horrified. We hadn't even given realisation; we just visited it.

Maureen: Yes, we just went to visit and spray vibrated water. And the bhoots sprayed stuff back at us, apparently, by the time we got back to Mother. It just shows you, because years later we can have programs in these places.

I can remember going to Cabela at some point when Mother was still with us. It had been difficult to get there, and I hadn't been for some time. When I came back, I couldn't work because every time I put my hand out, I was in a sea of vibrations. I would reach for the keyboard and become immersed in these vibrations in my hand, and I couldn't do anything. So I got in the car, drove around to Pat's, and when his wife opened the door, I fell into her arms and burst into tears because I had to be with a Sahaja Yogi. It was the collectivity. You miss the collectivity. It's where the vibrations are strongest if we're all heading the right way.

Interviewer: Taking you back to that India tour at Ajanta, Ellora, and all those places you visited, is there anything that Shri Mataji mentioned?

Pat: She wasn't with us then. She felt it was important for us to go. She sent us off to find our own way, although we were traveling with a couple of yogis.

When we came back from Nepal, we came by ourselves. We went by bus around all these terrifying bends on these precipices. We didn't dare look out the window. We bought thousands of statues in Nepal, deities. They were all packed in newspaper in Gavin's bag. When we got to the border, the guy thought we were smuggling. He solemnly unpacked everything. It was a huge pile of deities, and you could see his total disgust because to them, it meant nothing. He was expecting to find something. The pièce de résistance was this statue that was about nine inches high, really heavy. He hauled it out thinking, "At last, I've found something."

Maureen: Yeah, another one.

Pat: We traveled by bus and stayed in hotels. We had a wonderful time, really. We made our way back to Delhi by bus. I remember we ruined our livers by eating thousands of peanuts. These people were selling freshly picked peanuts at the station. Oh, they were fantastic. We ate so many. We got into a severe amount of trouble. We also had an argument on the train and caught our agnyas up. We all got told off a lot when we got back to Mumbai.

Maureen: We really were like kids, I'm afraid.

Interviewer: It's really beautiful and very, very sweet how you shared your memories with Shri Mataji. At this point, I have to also remind everyone that Pat and Maureen are actually brother and sister, so it's really very special. Thank you very, very much for your time this afternoon. Thank you for sharing the stories and the unbelievable times of being with the Adi Shakti herself and how she has blessed us so much in every way.

Maureen: Thank you very much.

Interviewer: We conclude today's session. Thank you, Maureen. Thank you, Pat. Jai Shri Mataji.

Both: Jai Shri Mataji.
