I bow to all the seekers of truth.
At the very outset, we have to know that truth is what it is. We cannot know the truth at human level. To give you a very good example, I would say that if you see a beautiful painting with rain and beautiful flowers and trees, but you don't get the rain on you. You just see outside. But if you have to have the experience of the rain, you have to go inside the picture. That also if you do is to enter in the picture, you will break the picture. So actually, we have to now understand that whatever we know about truth is just a picture.

Unless and until you have the experience of your being, of your self-knowledge, experience, all the words, all the descriptions are useless. Another good story I'll tell you about one gentleman. His name was Shapish and he was a big cheat. And he went to the king and he said that, If you give me money, "I'll make a very beautiful palace for you. You must also give me, allot me the land". After one year he said, "Still I'm making". Second year he said, "Still I'm making". Three years passed. After six years the king said, "I'm going to come and see the palace". So, when he went there the king saw nothing but the land, vacant land. No, there was no palace, nothing. So the Sharpish started telling him, "See now this is the big gate into which we enter in, and this is a very big palace here. And there are beautiful, very beautiful, big, big places to receive the audience". So the king was watching and smiling. He said, "Yes it's very good".
Ultimately, he said, "Now this is the main hall and in the center there is this seat, a special seat for the king to be seated. It's a throne which is made with beautiful lions and you sit on this throne". So the king said, "All right, it's a very good idea. I'm very much pleased by your work". "So will you please sit on the throne? I give you as a present, you sit on the throne". So Shapish went and sat on the throne in a sitting posture. So the king asked, "How do you feel? " He said, "Very comfortable". So the king said, "All right, go on sitting". He sat like that for half an hour and he got so tired! Then he fell at the feet of the king and he said, "Please forgive me".

In the same way, in the seeking of truth, we are going round and round and round of some people talking about it. There are many in India, I have seen, also so many come from abroad who are standing on their legs, standing on their heads. Some are reading books, some are reciting mantras, all kinds of things they are doing because they think they are seeking the truth. They are truthful, they are faithful, nothing wrong with them. But it's a punishment of Shapish on them. Some people starve. Some people renounce the world and do all kinds of things, thinking that they will achieve their Self, that they will know the absolute truth. So people go to different places and worship and do all kinds of sacrifices. They change their dresses, cut their hair, it's not going to help.

Actually, something has to happen to you by which you experience the truth. Because people are easily enamoured by all nonsensical things. And so many are lost in this punishment. So what is the truth? Whatever I am going to tell you, you should not also believe blindly. This blind faith has not helped us at all! People are fighting in the name of God everywhere. Because blindly they believe that they are Christians, Hindus, Muslims, all kinds of people. All kinds of wars are there, and so much is talked about peace but nobody has peace.
So whatever I am telling you now, you shouldn't believe it blindfolded. But if you experience it, then you must believe in it as honest people. You can [inaudible] as really sensible, wise people. You must believe in yourself. Because it is benevolent for you, for your family, your country and for the whole world.

So the first thing is that you are not this body, you are not this mind, you are no these emotions, you are not these, all the thoughts. But you are the pure Spirit. Unless and until, unless and until you know yourself, you cannot give up your seeking of truth. Christ has said very clearly that, "You are to be born again". Now if you put just a certificate born again, how can you become born again?
[Laughter]
It's all a false certificate. But if you are born again, then so many things happen to you and you get the experience, experience of the All-pervading Power of divine love. You see here beautiful flowers, here beautiful flowers, and we take it for granted. We never even doubt how such beautiful, different flowers are being created. Now if you ask the doctor, "Who runs your heart?" They will say, "It's the autonomous nervous system". Now if you ask them, "Who is this ‘auto’?" They don't know. It's just a name they have given. So once you have decided to be yourself, you must get the experience of this great Power of divine love which has created the flowers which has made you into human beings.

Even Mohammed Sahib has said it in Koran that, "You can feel the ‘Ruh’, the All-pervading Power on your fingertips when you get resurrected". And the fifth Imam, Imam means Realized soul, he has said very clearly that, "You will know absolute truth on your palms". When the resurrection will take place, when you will become a super human being or you will become the Self. So you have to experience this All-pervading Power on your fingertips. This divine love, we have never used before. In the name of God, we have used hatred, jealousies, all kind of secretive destructive things. So, the first thing is, we have to feel, experience this All-pervading Power in reality.

You have been already told about this power which is in the triangular bone. This is called as sacrum, this triangular, means a sacred bone. So, what is so sacred that the Greeks knew and they called it sacrum? Now this power is within all of you. In all the human beings exist this power. And when it opens and sprouts like a primule of the seed, it goes up through the different centres and comes out of the fontanel bone area. It's not just somebody puts water on your head and say that, Now you have become a Realized one, it's not so. William Blake has said that, "A priest cursed on my fontanel. He cursed me on my fontanel". So this is the real baptism, real again I say real. It's like this instrument if it is not connected to the means, it has no meaning.
[Laughter]
In the same way, if we are not connected to the means, we have no meaning. And then we have identity problems. I went to America and I was surprised at the young people: some are wearing ornaments here, some wearing here, some are wearing half pants with one side missing- haircuts, all kinds of things. And they told Me, "This is their identity problem". You are wise people, try to understand by changing your outside are you going to change your inside?

All right, let us see what happens when this Kundalini rises. Now there are seven centres, you have seen them. All these centres are responsible for our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being. For example, when this Kundalini rises, the first thing she does is to cure you, cure your physical elements. It cures your mental problems. All this modern problem of stress and strain is finished because there is a hole here [Brahmarandhra]. All the time this vital Power of love and compassion is flowing within you and your emotional problems are also solved. Now the spiritual problem is that you have to become the Spirit. As soon as you become one with the Divine, your Spirit's enlightenment comes in. Now your attention becomes enlightened. Your eyes, which are all the time full of lust, greed, envy, hatred become innocent. They become innocent and very powerful. There is a glint in our eyes which is like a light. And such a light when it falls on anyone can transform another person also.
