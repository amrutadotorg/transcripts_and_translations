Jai Shri Mataji.

Interviewer: Jai Shri Mataji, Uncle Manish Singh and Aunty. Thank you so much for joining us. We want to know from you, and it's really great that Aunty has joined in today as well. Before we proceed with the interview with both of you, may I just request you, Uncle, to please tell us about what Shri Mataji advised you regarding the Yuva Shakti? There was a lot of firsthand information that you shared with us, which we have in lots of Sahaj books like Raising Children and Shri Mataji's speeches. What is there about Yuva Shaktis, and what is it that she has told you that could benefit not just the Yuva Shaktis, but the younger generations to come?

Manish Singh: Sure. The Yuva, as we understand in Sahaj terms, means the power of Shri Ganesha. It is the power of innocence, which is the driving force of Yuvas. And of course, with that comes chastity. The reason being that the first relationship which was created was that of a brother and sister. I've said it many times that when the three Maha Shaktis—Shri Mahakali, Shri Mahasaraswati, and Shri Mahalakshmi—created, they created two children each. The sister and brother aspect was created before the marriage system was created. And so that power is so powerful.

The Yuvas, when you walk into this, even if you've come from outside, people should understand and be told that the relationship is that of a brother and sister, because that's how society actually grows with that innocence and that power of innocence. And so in everything that we do, that should be very visible.

We talked about it, that you all should have degrees. You should be professionals. You should do well in what you do. Because what is it? "You want me to be known as the mother of beggars?" So children, as they're growing up, whichever area they want to excel in, they must remember that the basis of it is they are first Sahaja Yogis. And then this is a role that they are playing, whatever you decide. Affinity for technology? Well, go in for it. Computer science, data analytics, Power BI, whatever it might be, but excel. You don't have to be number one or the best, but you need to excel in it because at this point now, we represent her, and we represent something much bigger than ourselves. So our individual things are okay, but Sahaja Yoga is a collective thing.

And we are representing the highest of the high, and that is her. So people judge Sahaja Yoga or evaluate Sahaja Yoga from the lens of the people who are saying that we are that. We can put Shri Mataji's photograph over there, and that's the source which is going to enlighten anyone. But people's perception about things is based upon how we express ourselves and how we conduct ourselves. And again, this can't be something which is an outside expression. It is something which we are innately.

And so she's talked in many talks; she says, "You're saints." Well, are we behaving like saints? Do we dress up like saints? Do we look like saints? Do we talk like saints? That is a self-reflection and a self-introspection that each person has to do. So at this point in time, one of the things which I see—I have young grandchildren, but there are so many other children. So are all the children equal to us because they are her children? When we look at any child, are we seeing them from the same lens? Sometimes you have to correct. And so are we correcting appropriately? Considerate, but sometimes you have to be very straightforward also about it and be like, you can't do this.

I'll give you an example. It was 1998. And I guess I went on a little bit of an ego trip. And so, Shri Mataji was annoyed with me. And so, she told some other Sahaja Yogis to tell Manish to step outside the collective for a while. And so that was a total shock, in a sense. And also it kind of destroys your basis, because that's who you are. My mother said that to me, oh my God. But she knew what had to be done. So when she said that, I was quite heartbroken. And at the same point, it was like, what did I do wrong? What did I need to correct?

And, how a mother is, I think about a month or two later, she had the leader of the US at that time call me. He says, "I was talking to Shri Mataji and she talked about you. And she said that that boy is very clear-hearted. He's very clear-hearted." And so I'm calling—and this was early morning, like six o'clock my time. I'm like, why are you calling me so early in the morning? This was like a life support for me. Yes, Shri Mataji scolded me, but as a mother, she has every right. As a parent, when we sometimes correct our children, it's not because we don't love them, but the correction is the love.

Heeru Singh: It's because we love them. Exactly. If you understand that. Because I remember when that happened, he just came home and he told us. And he told me one thing. He said, "Heeru, I cannot live without Sahaja Yoga. I cannot. So we have to, together, as children, we just have to do whatever it takes so that she's pleased with us." Because he said, "I will not be able to live. I'll die," he told me.

Interviewer: Such devotion. Such love. And what reassurance then when you get that call at 6 a.m.?

Manish Singh: Yes. So then later, at some point, Shri Mataji called me and she spoke to me and she said, "Manish, whatever I'm doing is for your benefit." Because as a mother, it's only her benevolence which comes. And I said, "Yes, Shri Mataji." And then later, she came to Los Angeles and she called me and then she said, "Okay, you can come back." But then she talked to me and she said, "You couldn't even write a letter to me." And I remember that part of time and I said, "Shri Mataji..." and I didn't know where to look also. So I was just looking at her feet and whatever she had to say, she said to me. And then lastly, she said to me, "Whatever I'm doing is for your benefit, for your benevolence."

And when she said, "You become alright," what else is needed? I realized the thing wasn't that you become okay this way or that way, but innately, you become that spirit. Because that is the goal of a Sahaja Yogi. Our basis is innocence, purity, chastity. We are a society which is—that's our foundation. And the ultimate is to become the spirit. Not even the chakras, not even vibrations, but the spirit. So this is this inner journey which has to happen. And it has to happen and become complete, hopefully, in this lifetime.

In the process, of course, one does a lot of introspection because it pushes you to that point and makes you look deeper and say, okay, I'm meeting with people, that's great. I do my pujas, that's great. But am I becoming that? The point is the becoming. It is not the doing. In Sahaja Yoga, I might sit in the morning, I might sit in the evening, I might foot soak, I might shoe beat. Okay, but those are activities. It is activities to become. So even treatments—treatments give you a reprieve and they allow the flow to move better. But that is not the goal. So if something is coming back again and again, then one has to reflect and see why it's coming and what do I need to do to correct it. Because otherwise, you can keep doing treatments and it will keep coming back, because the basic thing, one hasn't corrected.

Collectivity is so important, absolutely involved. But what happens if the collectivity is taking a downward path? Like there was this movement at a point where it was like, "Oh, we'll do collective Sahaj meditation, we'll do this, we'll do that." We'll change the norms from how Shri Mataji taught us and how she created. And I had to say to people, I said, "Look, I learned from her. I don't need to learn from anyone else." Because Sahaja Yoga is a very ancient thing. Whatever Shri Mataji had to tell us and how it would be done, it needs to be done that way. And the good part of it is, I think people took their little misadventures and tried their stunts, and then they came back to square one. So, one had to even stand up and say, "No, that's not okay." So if, say, everyone collectively is going down and the ship is going down, you're going to drown with it. No, you say, "No, we need to get out of it." And for that reason, you may be unpopular also. And so be it. I would say this, that some of my reactions were probably sharp, and so I could have done it differently. But that also one learns through experience.

Shri Mataji, even Sahaja Yoga, she said many times, "This is also actually an experiment of the divine." It becomes is actually up to us because we are the ones on stage. All the deities, all the angels, all the rishis, everybody is supporting us from behind. But we are the ones who are on display. So you have to see that part of it. And with that, one also discovered and realized that she is the source of everything. So the dedication and the bhakti that we talk about is to her, totally. And also the reverence.

But then there's the Mahamaya aspect of Adi Shakti, and it's constantly testing us, checking us. The minute we go into thought, Mahamaya is acting. And you can go into any direction and spiral. She said many times, "Your fortress is thoughtless awareness." And I would say now, she also said, "Unless you get to doubtless awareness, you'll be punished." So one should take that seriously. Because on one occasion, sitting with her, she said, "This is the last judgment, Manish." And I couldn't even look at her. I was just looking at her feet. And I just nodded my head and said, "Yes, Shri Mataji. I understand that."

Interviewer: Do you remember when this was, Uncle?

Manish Singh: This was soon after she asked me to come back. One has to take these things seriously. One has to take them very seriously. And one has to just embrace it, because that's the reality of it. And she told all of us that this is the Last Judgment. So when she said it's the Last Judgment, now somebody might say, when is Shri Kalki going to come? Well, he's already manifesting. You can see it.

Shri Mataji is very much there, and she's trying to keep her flock together, and also to grow the flock. So if that aspect of her in the Nirakar wasn't there, I don't think many of us would be wanting to stay on this earth anymore. But we have to take our responsibility. The same way any city which Shri Mataji went to, she'd be up till 2 o'clock in the morning, 3 o'clock in the morning, working out the city. It would rain. We would be rubbing her feet and massaging her feet, and she'd be up. And she'd be clearing this and clearing that. Why did she do all that? It was to not only benefit the Sahaja Yogis, but all mankind. So the vision is the whole globe and all mankind. Of course, we can't force anyone. But whatever we can do, we must do it. And the life should be dedicated to Sahaja Yoga.

I would also say to children that their careers and all that, they should be professional. They should be the best at whatever they want to do. But also, at the same point of time, realize that their career is not their life. That's not who they are. They have to play that play. Play it well. Enjoy it. Let other people enjoy it. But at the core, you are this being which is an instrument of the divine which is emitting her grace and her powers to all mankind. Because we have to be able to project these inner powers of us. Shri Mataji has talked about it. And she said you don't have to reflect them, you have to project these powers. And so one has to learn that part also because we don't know how to do it. So through experience, you learn it. And so one actually sits down and says, "Okay, how do I project?" And then gradually through the process, you learn.

I would also say one thing as dealing with very small children. And I mentor a group of small children. I was realizing, how do you get these small children involved and interested? So, they've come up with nice ways, but for them, that's a play, and then it finishes. But how do you have them interact with Shri Mataji? Because they're not seeing her physically. And so I was kind of looking through it, looking, looking, looking. And then I found in the mantra book, literally on the last page, these nine devotions that a Sahaja Yogi should have. And these were given by, I think, Sainath. But he's Adi Guru. When he's saying, Shri Mataji is saying.

And it's nine forms of devotion, which is hearing, which is bhajans, which is smaran, which is remembering. Then padasevan is doing the worship of Shri Mataji's feet. Archana, doing her puja. Namaskar, bowing down to her, so important. The friendship, which is the essence of collectivity, and the self-surrender. So what I started doing is that with these children now, when we have our little meeting, I first say, "Okay, come on now, you need to wash Shri Mataji's feet. Then you offer something at her feet. Then we'll sing some bhajan." It creates that thing. And with that, then you tell stories about Shri Mataji, tell stories about the deities. So that spiritual part of them, it's already there, but now you're just helping it to grow.

I think I've said a lot of things, but the essential part of it is, you know, learn that you are a Sahaja Yogi. You're an angel. You're a saint. And it should reflect and be very visible in everything that we do, how we do it. And it's coming from inside, not an outside show. It doesn't matter what anyone's thinking about you. It matters what you are innately. And that should be very visible. And so the joy should come there. The gravity should come there. The friendship should come there. And the friendship should be something which is very deep, not superficial.

Interviewer: Wow. Okay. Thank you. Blitzed out with that. And it's a really nice way of actually children now and in the future experiencing, because as you said, the subtle system, the yantra, is there inside all of us and the generations to come. It's doing the six forms of worship that Shri Sainath of Shirdi has said, and which we do it every day in our meditation, unconsciously, without knowing those names, but we do them. So that's so nice that Shri Mataji has actually told us in such simple ways, and we're already doing it and maybe carry it on forever and ever to please her. And that is our only aim. Thank you for that, Uncle. Now, if I may ask, Aunty, which part of India are you from? And there was a very nice incident which relates to when you were newly married and came to the household. What was it like for you?

Heeru Singh: For me, I was not born in Sahaja Yoga. But when Sahaja Yoga started in the 70s, my mother came to Sahaja Yoga, probably around '72, '73. And at that point, she had lost her own mother. So she used to pray to God and she said that "you have taken my physical mother away, you have to replace her," because she was very emotionally attached to her mother. And then at that time, she found Shri Mataji in the beginning days of Sahaja Yoga in Mumbai. I was, I think, around maybe eight or nine years old at that time. I have three older brothers, but my younger brother and I were the ones that mummy would always take for all the programs and everything.

He never stopped my mother, and we lived in a joint family. And everybody opposed, but my father would always let her go. And in those days, being the daughter-in-law of the house, Shri Mataji's programs would run very late. But Shri Mataji sometimes would drop her, bring her to the house to say that she's brought her, because you know how culturally in India, like, a daughter-in-law of the house, going without her husband, coming late at night, that kind of a thing.

So I did kind of grow up, and as a child, I was to be very nervous about exams and things like that. So mummy would make me do foot soak. She would work on me. She would do the Ganesha Atharvashirsha, and I just knew that I felt good. And we would, my brother and me, we would go for all the pujas, grew up with all the collective there. And I was the youngest child.

But I never really understood Sahaja Yoga or what Sahaja Yoga is. One thing that I knew in my heart was that I just adore Shri Mataji. I love her beautiful face, and that's all. I just want to be there and nothing else was important to me. And whatever mummy would make me do, I knew I felt good. But that was it for me. So I wasn't really seeking God, but I just happened to find God.

And then I remember as a child, one incident where I had a lot of pain in my appendicitis. I didn't know it was appendicitis. But those days, it was a small collective. You all knew each other. And Sir CP was posted in Bombay—those days it was Bombay, now it's Mumbai. So mummy would just, you know, anything wrong, you just go to Shri Mataji. So she just took me. And I remember we had gone to the doctor before that, and the doctor said, "Yeah, it is appendicitis, but we have to wait a little bit. It's not matured enough to do surgery." So mummy just took me to Shri Mataji, and Shri Mataji just put her foot on my appendicitis. And next time we went to the doctor, the doctor said, "What happened? There's nothing now." So those are the miracles that she...

Interviewer: How old were you?

Heeru Singh: I was probably 10 or 12 at that time. So this would be 1974, '75, probably.

Interviewer: Wow.

Heeru Singh: Yeah. So that was it. And then it came to the time of getting married. My father, he was not a Sahaja Yogi, but he was innately a very pious man. He never smoked, never drank. My grandfather smoked, he drank a little bit of brandy at night to make him sleep, but my father never did. And that was one of the conditions that my mom had told her parents when she got married, that I want to marry a man who does not drink or smoke. But my mom's side of the family, I was born in a Sindhi family, they were very much into this wrong, false guru. So they really attack you.

So my father had some heart issues, but he was coming around. And they had made a visit to America, and after that, they were going to a family reunion and then they were coming to London. But at that point, he passed away on his flight going to Shri Mataji, in the plane before the flight took off. But it was like he was coming to her. And Shri Mataji then met my mother a week later, after the funeral and everything. She came up actually on the same flight that mummy was going to fly. She came back on the same flight a week later. And Shri Mataji came up to meet her and she told her that, "He was coming to me, but that rakshas took him. But he went very peacefully." And that was one thing that Shri Mataji has always said, that the blessings are always there.

I think even when we got married, I remember Manish once told Shri Mataji that, "I think I should move away from my family," because they're not Sahaja Yogis. And then Shri Mataji said, "No, it's okay. Let them be there." Or even when he moved to America also, like he said, you know, maybe he should move. She said, "No, the blessings are there." Even though they were not Sahaja Yogis, the blessings were there.

So, coming back to my marriage and my growth in Sahaja Yoga, like my husband always tells me, he says, "You just found it, so you don't value it." I do value it, but it was a different journey. Like I said, everybody's journey is very different. But he was always seeking. And his mom would always tell me when I got married, they told me, "Oh, this is just a phase. He's been to so many, like this guru, this guru, but nothing satisfied him." He went to a Christian school also, and he used to come home with rosaries and things like that, but nothing satisfied his soul. But when he found Sahaja Yoga, that was the turning point for him.

For me, I still had to find Sahaja Yoga. Just loving Shri Mataji and adoration of her was not enough. But then she got me married. She got me married to such a man who was like this. So, even then, I still didn't really grow. I used to attend all the programs. I used to go everywhere. And I thought I'm a Sahaja Yogi. I wasn't.

Then he came to America. And we had to wait a little while before we came. At that point, we were from Delhi. We moved to Bangalore, that's where Manish had his posting, and then from there, he was asked to come to America. So, I stayed on with my in-laws in Bangalore for a couple of years. And I was there at home one day, and I just sat down in front of Shri Mataji's photograph. And I started crying. And I wasn't crying that I was separated from my husband. I was just crying because I felt I'm talking to her. Because even if Shri Mataji is there, you were just walking. But for me, it was different now. He's not there. How do I go?

But then in Bangalore, I just prayed to her in front of her photograph. And I cried. I cried my heart out. And I said, "Shri Mataji, either I should be..." Because even when I used to go for the programs, I used to get scoldings from Shri Mataji. Your left is catching. This is catching. But I would still want to be there. I didn't want to leave her pallu, the fold of her sari. I wanted to just be there. No matter even if she scolds me, I want to be there. He used to cook for Shri Mataji, I would go and serve the chapati and all. But again, that's just not enough.

And that's when I prayed to her and I said, "Shri Mataji, I don't want to be one foot here and one foot there. You either make me feel complete and whole and let me feel this love of yours in my being. Otherwise, I don't want to be in Sahaja Yoga. I don't want to be this half-baked Sahaja Yogi." And I think some... you don't know sometimes what mantra to say, what to say. I don't know all of that. All that he would know. I didn't know. But it was a sincere prayer from my heart when I asked. And you won't believe it. The way my Kundalini rose and the vibrations that just flew. And it was such a tremendous experience. I can't tell you. It was just beautiful. Again, it's not that he can make me do it or you can make me do it. And it's not that you have to know all these mantras. But even a sincere prayer from your heart, she will take care of you.

And then after a couple of years, we moved back to Delhi. And I just had this sudden desire that I just want to see her. I want to go and meet her. I don't know why. So Dr. Nigam, who's a very dear friend of Manish and knows us very well, I just told him, "Bhai Sahib, I want to meet Shri Mataji." So he told me, he says, "Heeru, Manish is a very good friend of mine. Do you have any problem? Tell me." I said, "I don't have any problem. I really don't. I don't know why, but I just want to." And he says, "Okay, we're having like a little private music program on my terrace. Why don't you come?" So I said, okay. So with my three kids, I took them and I went for the program. And I sat at her feet and I looked at her, and I just said... and she told me, "Come tomorrow and see me."

So I attended the program, everything. Then the next day in the morning, I remember dressed nicely, standing outside her room and praying to Shri Mataji, "I've always got scoldings from you, but this time, Shri Mataji, I don't want that scolding. I just want your love and nothing else." And then she made me wait there for about almost an hour and a half or something. But I think she was just... convincing me so that I would just be absolutely... Then I went to her feet, and I said, "Thank you, Shri Mataji." And she told me, "For what?" I said, "You know, Shri Mataji, I just raised my little finger towards you, but you gave me the world." The world was not that I was still able to go to America, because I wasn't getting my visa. It took many years, but I knew within that time, she was working it out for me. Because I had to do it on my own, not with him on top of my head. I had to do it on my own. So it is your individual journey. No one can make you do it.

Like everything started falling in place. And then when I just said, "Thank you, Shri Mataji," she looked at me, gave me a pat, and she gave me a kiss. And then she told me, "I was waiting for this. This is what I was waiting for." And then I was just telling her, I said, "Shri Mataji, I don't know what happens to me. I'm sitting in the chartered bus, and I'm going to work, and I'm listening to bhajans. And I'm so involved with that, that I used to miss getting off at my stop." And then she looked at me and she says, "No, that's not how you are supposed to be. You don't have to be lost so much that you forget yourself. You have to be in the present."

So that's how it was. And then I remember she told me, and this was at the ashram in Delhi... that evening there was a meditation. And that day, she told me, she said... and I was just so happy that I didn't want to eat anything. If Shri Mataji said, "Eat," I didn't because I was just so happy inside that I finally found my mother. She gave me love, not a scolding. And then I went for the program in the evening, and my stomach was churning, hurting. And then I said, "Oh, you know what, Shri Mataji told me I should eat. And I did not."

And then again, with the three kids... I remember in the beginning days when we were married and had the children, he would always be going and we would go, but he would never really help me with the children. And I used to be always not enjoying because I never learned to just give. But later, after he left, I used to travel with the Sahaja Yogis. And my mother-in-law would tell me, "You want to go, you go, but why are you taking the children?" I said, "No, it is important for them." So now also, everybody remembers, like, "Oh, you and the three kids." No matter what programs, I used to be there and they used to be sleeping, falling off, but they would all be there. But the collective was always there. I went to Ganpati Phule with all three of them and they were little, you know, my daughter was just two. But I never felt anything because she just took care. Everybody was just there doing it.

So it is when you surrender totally, that's when you are. So like your daughter had mentioned earlier, we're all a piece of work. I still feel I am, that piece of work that is there. But it's never too late if you really and sincerely ask, she is there to protect you. And even now, I go up and down, up and down, I might go, but I know she's there.

I think it's funny, his parents were not Sahaja Yogis. His mother would have become a Sahaja Yogi, but I think it was always that conflict of she felt like Shri Mataji has taken over her son. And then later, my son had to explain to her that, "Dadi, Papa loves you very much. You are his mother who has given him birth and Shri Mataji is his spiritual mother." But she took me out from that environment and put me in a place where... and I lost my father when I was just 13. But she gave me also that security of a father that I wanted. Everything that I wanted, she just put it out for me. When we came here, we didn't have anything, but it just worked out. She just does everything. Everything. She does it all.

Interviewer: When was this meeting with Shri Mataji, this desire that you had?

Heeru Singh: I came to America in 1998. So I would probably say it may have been around the end of '96, I think.

Interviewer: So Shri Mataji, as generous a mother, we have known no other. She would give a lot of presents. Is there anything that you cherish?

Manish Singh: You know, just without saying anything, everything I have has come from her. I'm very clear about it; I know that. And she's been extremely generous. From a worldly stage, yeah, she gave lots of gifts. This bracelet I'm wearing was given by her.

Interviewer: Wow.

Manish Singh: So the reason why I wear it is because she gave it. There's no other reason. I would say in 1989-90, I spent time with her in Pratishthan and in Delhi. So we were in Pratishthan. Pratishthan was being built. I think the structure had been built, but the furnishings had not been done. And then one morning I woke up and was just getting ready and coming to her. And she came and she said, "Yellow," and she gave me a watch. Not that I didn't have a watch, but it was special that she gave. Down the years, she gave so many things. Shri Mataji was generosity personified.

But I would also say this to especially the ladies, that while she was extremely generous and she gave things, she never did anything to spoil anyone. And even in her talks, if you listen, she said, "I know what it's like to be a grihini and how you have to run the household. And sometimes the money is limited and how you have to manage effectively in that." So, whatever you have, whatever is given to you, be satisfied with it. Establish that peace within you and the balance. The balance is also important. So all three need to be there. You can say, "Oh, I'm generous," but then you're going beyond your means. Or, "I'm peaceful now," but is the other part of it also established?

Also, as you know, she's Rajalakshmi and she's Mahalakshmi. I'll tell you of an incident in 1997-98. I told you I spent a lot of time with Shri Mataji in Noida at her house. So if you've been to the house, Sir CP's living area was on the first floor. Shri Mataji's was on the second floor. And on top was the terrace. So Sir CP, when he would come up, because they would eat in Shri Mataji's area, he would come up the stairs, a short walk up. And so, there was this person who would continuously turn off the lights. And somehow that went to Shri Mataji, and maybe Sir CP said, "They always keep turning off the light." And then she kind of questioned this person. And he's like, "Oh, Mother, the electricity bill is so much." And she looked at him and she said, "I'm Mahalakshmi." Shri Mataji never really said those things, but she said, "I'm Mahalakshmi." And I was sitting there and I was just watching and I was like, okay. Okay.

So, sometimes in our human awareness, we kind of get lost in that. The fact remains that she's divinity personified. She's the source of it all. And also, as Sahaja Yogis, we have to remember, not only we have to become the spirit, she said this, that you have to become divine. And you have to let your divinity express itself. And that's not going to happen by going to human means. We have to kind of separate ourselves from that and understand and know and innately let that divine power express itself. Because if we are her channels, then we have to be the channel. Then we can't have Manish coming up, because Manish can be a riot. But the spirit is just a blessing.

Can you imagine so many angels? The world should have changed by now. So we have to embrace that part of us so that the divine vibrations flow. I say to children many times, "You guys are used to the internet. Now if the internet is faulty, it's not working, you're going to say, 'This is a piece of crap.' Same way, if we are supposed to be that channel and the channel is not receiving... I mean, crappy." So understand that point. So our responsibility is immense, but it's a responsibility of joy. Also, while it's a responsibility, it's a responsibility of joy. And it's sharing that love and that joy of the spirit, which she's bestowing on us continuously.

Interviewer: In India, respect for elders is inherent. But for you, that recognition of Shri Mataji is absolutely absolute. How would you differentiate? So if you could illustrate it with an example, so people don't get confused.

Manish Singh: Very early in Sahaja Yoga, I was one day sitting with Shri Mataji. I don't know if there was anybody else there with me or not. But I said to Shri Mataji, "Shri Mataji, when Shri Ram came, Shri Sita was there, Shri Hanuman was there, Shri Lakshman was there. When Mother Mary came, Lord Christ was there. When Prophet Muhammad came, then Shri Hazrat Ali was there, then Hazrat Fatima was there, and then Hassan and Hussein were there. So Shri Mataji, who came with you?" I actually asked her that question.

She kept quiet for a minute. And then she said, "But at this time, I've come by myself with all my powers in totality."

So that kind of answered that question right there and there. And so when I looked at the family, and I know Sadhana Didi, I know Kalpana Didi, I know the grandchildren, all of them. And on occasion, she said to me things about the grandchildren. Like, Anand was a small little boy when we came to Sahaja Yoga, and he used to keep jumping around. And so one day she said to me, she said, "He's like Buddha," because he would come to us and say, "How much tapasya have you done? How much penance have you done?" And we'd look at him and he said, "I've done a lot of tapasya." So I said, "Very good."

On one occasion, I was offering Shri Mataji tea here in the morning, this was in Noida. And she just looked at me and she said—this was around the time when Sonu was going to get married—"Kalpana and Sadhana were in my stomach for nine months. Even that has some meaning." And I just looked at her feet and I said, "Yes, Shri Mataji."

But at the same point of time, as I pointed out to you, on many occasions, Shri Mataji said to me very point blank, and I'm talking to some other people who had similar experiences, she said, "Don't give them so much importance." So they were her family. We gave them the respect. We still give them that respect. But, I think Dr. Nigam said it to me so nicely once. He said, my aastha is to Shri Mataji, not to anybody else. Nobody else. I have a very nice relationship with all of them. I respect them. But that's as far as it goes. And things which were done by the family is not what Shri Mataji wanted or said. So you have to go to what she said and what she wanted.

For example, about pujas, you asked about Havan. I'll tell you an interesting incident from 1997, Ganpati Phule. Shri Mataji was in Mumbai, I was in Mumbai. And because she was close by, I would go there in the morning and spend time with her. And so one day, the leader of India called me. His name was Arun Goyal. He said, "Oh, Manish, you're probably seeing Shri Mataji. So when you see her, can you please ask her if we should do a Havan before she comes?" So I said, "Okay, Arun, I'll ask her." When I met Shri Mataji, I mentioned this to her. And she looked at me and she said, "Arun ko bolo Havan karega, ya hawa khayega?" Which means, "Tell Arun, will he do a Havan or will he just eat air?"

So this thing that you have to keep doing Havans all the time is also not part of Sahaj. You do a Havan when you need it. But you just don't say, "Okay, now we have a puja weekend, so it has to start with a Havan." No. I'm telling you exactly what she said to me. And the other part of it is, of course, I worshipped her many times in collective pujas and all the rest of that. You'd be surprised, I never attended even one Havan with her.

So I don't know. And then when she said that to me... so sometimes when I see people go overboard and be like, "Oh, we must do a Havan, then we must do this," and I'm like, "No, you don't have to do any of those things." But if you need it, for example, if somebody needs to do candling, then you better do candling. If you need to do foot soak, you need to shoe beat, do it. But doing that doesn't make you a Sahaja Yogi. You know, those are tools or weapons. These are our astras. A lemon is our astra. If we need it, you can do a matka, if you need it. But you don't keep saying, "Okay, now I need to keep doing a matka all the time." These are treatments. I mean, if you have a stomach upset, you can take some stomach medicine, but then you don't say, "Okay, let me take some medicine for the throat and this and that." That's the discretion of Sahaja Yoga.

Heeru Singh: I'd like to add one thing about getting back to what you asked about giving respect. I remember when we got married, his parents were not Sahaja Yogis, but his mother was really an embodiment of being a grihini, actually. But again, Manish said that, "Oh, maybe the children need to be in a more Sahaj environment and I should move out." And he asked Shri Mataji. She looked at him and she said, "You've come here to make and not to break." So even if, I think, culturally in India, we know how to give that respect. And yes, not everybody is meant to be a Sahaja Yogi, but they can still lead very Sahaj lives. If it is in your destiny to be that or to meet God... yes, they did meet God, but to know that this is God.

I did live with his parents a long time, and many times he would tell me, "You're more married to my family than to me." I said, "But yes, the children were small and I was living with them and you would be traveling. So yes, I was more married to them." But I did all my duties. And for that, even to this day, I am respected for that. They know. And I have to be grateful also, because Shri Mataji puts you in that environment, but you get to learn, you get what you needed and the blessings are there not only for us, but for them too. They went through ups and downs in their lives and I was part of that, but I saw how things would again fall back into place.

Towards the end, going through troubled times in life, his mother started reading, doing the path, the Japji Sahib. I would be doing my meditation in the morning and playing my bhajans, and she would be doing her thing. So there was a very peaceful balance, atmosphere in the house, which was very nice. It was good for the children, it was good for everything. And she had a share of health issues and all, but it still was peaceful. Like his father passed very peacefully without suffering. His mom also, she went through times, but again, very peaceful.

Manish Singh: I once said to Shri Mataji, when I was in America and they were in India, I said, "Shri Mataji, I feel my parents have all the responsibility of the children." And she looked at me and said, "No, they are getting their blessings." So even in those things, you've got to see how the whole works.

Heeru Singh: And I think it is just like how Shri Mataji said that even if one person knows God and has felt that love, then the blessings first start in the house. Then when you go out to work, people see that in you. Then it spreads to the city, it spreads to the country, and that's how it starts. Manish works for LAUSD and his executive secretary is also a Sahaja Yogi. She comes to Sahaja Yoga and he never tells me or shares about his stress at work. He deals with it and he comes home and he's done. I never know what his stress is, but she happened to tell me that, "Heeru, your husband is such an example." She said that he had one very bad boss who was making everybody's life miserable and he was really after him. But I saw that man always staying calm, always staying... and that man was ousted and was exposed for all his wrongdoings and everything just works out.

Interviewer: It's just so reminds how you're saying how Uncle's so calm. It reminded me of my own father dealing with so much stress from his office, petty politics, but he would never bring it home. We were just so protected from it all. So I think this is a good message for people who are in families where Sahaja Yoga is not for the whole family.

Manish Singh: I will also say this, that for all of us to grow, one of the things that all Sahaja Yogis, whether old or young, should know is that she is the source of everything. So you don't have to go to anyone else. But also the obedience, the obedience to what she has said should be absolute. Young kids sometimes, "Oh, I'm going in for a tattoo." I'm like, "Really? Become part of Sahaja Yoga." She's said these things. She did not like people walking in front of her in shorts or short skirts. Why should you even wear them? I'm telling you to date, I do not wear shorts for a simple reason: she didn't like them. I don't wear denim because she did not like jeans. I wear corduroys, but I don't wear denim.

Somebody might say, "Now you're being too extreme." Maybe. But one of the things of a Sahaja Yogi is to please her. So find that thing in everything that you do. How do I please her? Even when you cook or you're maybe a carpenter, enjoy it. This is a service which you're doing and you're creating something beautiful out of it. I see some of the young girls, they want to wear something off-shoulder, they want to do this. Why do you want to do that? Don't you know that Shri Mahakali over here and Shri Mahasaraswati here, when we use our hands, those are the two powers which are working? Why do you want to insult them, especially when your chakras have been awakened? What is that attraction that you have to be like... one side you say, "I'm unique," the next side you just want to be commonplace. Know who you are. Your uniqueness is your spirit. You are a Sahaja Yogi.

So a Sahaja Yogi, the rules are defined, the boundaries are defined. If you cross them, there will be problems. I'll give you an example. We were very young, I think we were like 23 or something. We were one day sitting with Shri Mataji and she said, "You know these mustaches and beards and all these are just expressions of ego." Guess what? We all had mustaches. And next day, the mustache was off. I'm just telling you. For us, it was like a law. Some of our wives looked at us like, "What happened?" The point was, Shri Mataji just made a comment and they were off. Because why would you do anything which is contrary to what pleases her? Simple thing. These pants with holes in them, why do you have to wear these holy pants? You attract the bhoots.

Some of these kids I see, they've got hair going like this. Could we ever go in front of Shri Mataji like that? The answer is absolutely not. She'd be like, "What is this?" And we'd be straightened out in less than one minute. And so what gives you the right? And if an elder is telling you, listen to them for heaven's sake. They're not trying to terrorize you. They're just telling you what's good for you. Otherwise, some of the bhoots might be looking and say, "Oh, one of us," and then you get a bhoot. Come on. There's actually a talk of hers where she said that even badhas are important because Sahaja Yogis are so casual about everything. So if the badha is not there, how do you correct them? And so somebody asked her, "Then Shri Mataji, how long is the badha supposed to be there?" And she said, "That's totally dependent on you."

Talking about the pujas, she's defined her times for pujas. Now there was this time when Shri Mataji was keeping quiet and so other people were making some decisions, but those weren't necessarily her decisions. And so they'd do a puja at three o'clock, four o'clock in the afternoon. Before that, did we ever hear of pujas at two o'clock and three o'clock in the afternoon? Never. And luckily I found—so people said, "What's your source?"—I found that talk where Shri Mataji is saying, "These are my timings." If you want to do pujas, then you can do them at five in the morning, or else after that, do that after 11 in the morning. In the afternoon, she would always sleep, she would rest. And then she would wake up around six, have a snack, and then she'd be ready for whatever program around seven. How difficult is it? Sometimes I've heard people say it's inconvenient for families. Well, if these children are Sahaja Yogi children, nothing is going to go wrong if they have to be up till 10 or 11 o'clock at night once in a month or whatever it might be. They're Sahaja Yogis. They should be able to adapt to those things. So even parents, "All this time the food has to be served." Oh God. If it doesn't get served, they still live. Nothing is going to go wrong. These are Sahaja Yogis. Bring them up like saints. You cannot bring them up the way you and I grew, because what sustains them is when they get that divine nectar and that divine food, which is vibrations, not this human stuff.

And how can people in Sahaja Yoga, young boys, girls, whatever it is, have boyfriends and girlfriends? I don't understand that. Have brothers and sisters. Somebody might say, "Oh, but..." First establish your chastity. That's through brotherhood and sisterhood. Then your marriages will be successful, everything else will be successful because the base is very much established. The foundation is innocence, is chastity, it is Shri Ganesha, it is Mother Kundalini. She's love personified. So if you say my love is directed to two people, well, you're going against her, because she loves the whole universe. Now you've got to become the same.

Interviewer: It is so simple and yet when one gets mental, it becomes complex, doesn't it? Do you find yourselves in these moments and what do you do to get out of that state?

Manish Singh: Two things. Number one, prayer to Shri Ganesha. Because Shri Mataji said you need to have Shri Ganesha fully established in you. "That kindly make me that innocence, that total purity. Make me auspicious and make me my divine self. And under your supervision, kindly establish my self-realization fully in this lifetime." And, "Shri Mataji, you're the love of this whole universe. It's your love which created everything, sustains everything. Just get me to that point."

To be answering clearly, does one fall? Yes, many times. But then that is the prop which brings me up again. And I'm like, no, that is my goal. That is my destination. It's at her feet. And in that, the whole universe is there. Even the lords of the universe reside at her feet. So who am I? If I'm even allowed to be there, that's the biggest blessing. And I don't have to be anything. You know, you've heard the story of the murli and Shri Krishna. The murli, the flute, is supposedly what Shri Radha was jealous of because it's attached to the lips of Shri Krishna. And its specialities? "I'm hollow. Whichever way he plays me, I get played." Now if somebody says, "Are you that flute?" the answer to that is not fully, but the attempt and the desire, and also not only the desire but the action to become that, is very much there. And with that, I would also say, through her grace, that will also happen.

Heeru Singh: It's funny, you know, you are having some problems or you're thinking about how I should resolve it, and this has happened to me several times. But then you go to the collective and you listen to a talk, and then you feel that talk is actually answering your question that you have. And it always would be. Because when Manish was in America and we were there, I would take the children and take the bus and go from Noida all the way there. There was a charter bus for the yogis. And I used to wait for that whole week. Because again, living in a non-Sahaj environment, sometimes you do get bogged down. When your husband is there, he can put his foot down and say no. As a daughter-in-law of the house, it would get difficult. So I used to have those moments like, what do I do? Or what do I say? But then I was bound by my maryadas not to say anything. But then I would just go and listen to her talk. And I used to feel that she's actually talking to me and I'm getting all my answers. And then I would come home and I'm fine. I'm ready for the next week.

In the early days, you would see the children, they would just sit. We never used to give them toys or books to distract them. They just knew that they have to sit and they would sit. It would be two hours, they would sit. Maybe they would fall asleep sometimes, but never roaming around, walking around. Like I see now, they have a separate room for the children and the mothers sit there with the children because you teach the child. It starts at home.

When I came to the United States, there were ashrams everywhere and we lived in the ashram. And I used to feel like a marriage house. Every day there's like, you know, it was so much fun because we used to do things collectively. We used to do programs collectively. Everybody followed the rules. You get up in the morning, you do foot soak in the evening, everyone doing things collectively. Here, in America, the outside attractions are so much. So it was so nice. But now that I see, America is such a huge country, but I can count on my fingers, maybe there are only three or four ashrams. And everybody is living their individual life. So you see, then the mothers are also more burdened. I remember when I came there, there was a yogini, she was having a baby. I looked after the baby. I took care of her. I did all those things because somebody is there, because the old and the young are living together. But it's not so anymore because everyone, it's you, me, myself and my child. And now you see the people are facing problems. The children are... and it's sad. It's really sad to see that.

Manish Singh: The one last thing which I would say is Sahaja Yoga is a place full of joy, full of love, full of compassion, full of all that. But also you have to work towards it. So this thing, this parallel living that people do, that outside I'm like this, then inside I'm like this... no, you have to be innately that. And that's what needs to come out all the time, whether you're inside, outside, whatever it might be. Because what defines us is, "I'm a Sahaja Yogi." And so establish those principles inside, establish your dharma, the Vishwa Nirmal Dharma. And let that manifest and let those values and those powers manifest. It's no longer even qualities, it's let those powers manifest and don't embrace anything which is contrary to that. You know, this thing that I have to keep up with my family, you've got a Kansa Mama. Well, you know, why do you have to keep up with him? You've got to let go of the thing because otherwise it's going to eat into you and it's going to destroy you. Nobody's saying that you hate, but at the same point of time, there's a clear demarcation.

It embraces the whole universe. Just become that and let everyone become that too. Because even the ones who might be misplaced, they need to see two million people who are actively doing it. I'm telling you, two million Sahaja Yogis really become Sahaja Yogis and emit the powers of Shri Mataji... this whole universe will change.

Heeru Singh: Yes, like sometimes you see some of the children grow up and they've become like this. But then again, you see other children and many times that I just tell Manish, "You know what? Shri Mataji's vision will stay." Because when you see some of the other children and you see the innocence on their face so intact, then you feel no... because sometimes you're a little like, what's going to happen? Will this become another religion? But then you know that again, you don't have to worry. She knows. So I think all of us, we really do have a huge responsibility, especially us older Sahaja Yogis. We have to do that so that the foundation, as you say, is strong so the blocks building on it are going to be strong.

Shri Mataji had told him once that, "When the time comes, you have to speak. Even if people don't like it, if you know this is the truth, then you have to stand and fight for the truth." Because we have to be her soldiers. Sometimes you feel like, "Oh, I don't want to hurt somebody's feeling, I don't want to be the bad person." I think it's okay to be. Because sometimes Manish is that strict person. But then later they realize and they say thank you. No, it's important. And when you see something wrong, then yes, you must correct it.

Interviewer: This is like being the warrior that Shri Mataji told you, isn't it?

Manish Singh: I think a Sahaja Yogi is the most peaceful person, but when required, then you have to be that too. Take the sword. I mean, not literally.

Interviewer: Well, thanks to Shri Mataji, we have all these invisible protections and armaments. It's all her blessings. Thank you so much for taking this time out. Most of all, thank you, Shri Mataji, for making it all happen for us and making it all so easy. Please hold our hands and guide us every step.

Manish Singh: I would also say, Sushmita, it was a pleasure meeting Sridevi, because in just the short conversation that I had, I could see that this is a young lady who is sensible. There is wisdom and also there is some grounding in her, which is wonderful to see in children.

Interviewer: It's all thanks to Shri Mataji. And when you were saying you don't wear denim, I have to share, our son, Vinay, who was born on the Indian Independence Day—because my husband is English—he hasn't worn jeans because he said, "No, Shri Mataji said not to wear jeans." I'm not going to wear it, since a toddler. So it's the children, as you both have said. She's looking after them. We just happen to be here.

Manish Singh: Never forget that. And I'm glad to hear that there's some young person doing that, because otherwise, it's this Uncle Manish who's saying, don't do this, don't do that. And I'm like, okay, it's sharing with you. Now, whether you do it or not, it's up to you. But it's true. She did not care for denim. She used to say about shorts... "nikkar pehen ke ghoom rahe ho!" "Nikkar" is Hindi for shorts, for people who wouldn't know.

For the young adults, with the age group of 20 and 25, she would call them what? "Gadhe Pachisi." When we were 25, we'd be packing her bags, putting the bags here, there, everywhere on the India tour. And we'd be standing there. And she'd look at us and say, "What are you doing? Go and start serving." So then we used to pick up the buckets and we used to go and serve. And then she, with humor, she said, "You're the 25-year-old donkeys."

Heeru Singh: Amazing. My son used to say, "Oh, you were so lucky. You must have been sitting with your mother and meditating." I said, "You think so?" You had to be alert like this. Just a glance, and you had to understand what it meant. So there was no meditation going on, but you were in meditation because she was taking care of you. You had to know exactly what she needed and what she wanted. And just one look, or she'd just do a flick of her finger, and you had to understand it.

Interviewer: We had such a good laugh because, like you say, there was no time like free time or chilling out time. You're always alert because the goddess is there. And you have to understand her desire and be that channel, be that instrument. So thank you so much for the beautiful insights into your special times with Shri Mataji. Totally unparalleled. Thank you, Shri Mataji, for giving us these elders who actually are instrumental in making sure that your legacy continues. Thank you again, Aunty and Uncle.

Jai Shri Mataji.
