I was in Scotland at the end of 1981, and I was absolutely desperate for God-realisation, to become one with God. I did so many terrible things in my search for that. Then I was on a bus, and as we passed, I suddenly saw this tiny little photo on a wall. I thought, "Oh my God!" I rang the bell, rushed out, and saw it was a photo of Shri Mataji for a meeting.

So I went to the meeting, and as soon as I walked in, I thought, "This is it. I've found what I'm looking for." The yogis had only come up there for a couple of weeks, and then they just disappeared and went back to London. I didn't know anything about Sahaja Yoga, except that you had to foot soak, so I was foot soaking like crazy.

A couple of months later, I got a telegram from the leader at that time, from India, saying Shri Mataji was going to give a talk in London. He'd somehow gotten my address at the meeting. So I rushed down to London, went to the meeting, and afterwards went to see Shri Mataji and shook her hand. She said, "Oh, he seems like a nice boy."

I thought, "Oh my God, I've shaken God's hand." I didn't want to wash it for ages after that. So that was how it started.

Was that an instant reaction, though?

Yeah, I just knew, that's it. Because I'd done so many bad things, and so many stupid things as well, searching. I was about 17 or 18. As soon as I walked into the meeting, that was it. This is where it was.
