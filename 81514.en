I don't actually remember getting my realisation as such, because I find it very difficult to experience anything, like vibrations or whatever. I can't feel somebody else's vibrations.

I went to Dr. Johnson House in the center of Birmingham. There was a meeting there, and we'd all sat down. People kept saying, "It won't be much longer, it won't be much longer." It went on and on, and nothing happened. Then suddenly, in the distance, you could hear a lady's voice laughing coming down the corridor. It was Mother, actually coming into the hall.

I've listened to other people, and I'm very impressed by their total recall. As far as I'm concerned, all I have is a vague sort of image. I can't remember any details whatsoever.

I think it was the Sunday afterwards, we went to Ballas at Tamworth in the way that John and Francis did. We went there and had a meeting. But again, all I remember is going there. I can't remember any of the details at all.
