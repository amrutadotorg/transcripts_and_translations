I never knew what the Ardhya Stotram was, but see how she drops the seeds. Later on, after a few years, I came to India. Every year, my elder sister and sister-in-law, in our village, had a Navchandi Yajna. She gave me a little Durga Saptashati as a gift. When I opened the book, there was the Ardhya Stotram. And I connected that Shri Mataji likes the Ardhya Stotram. So she dropped the seed that in the future, Ardhya Stotram would be very powerful. When we do Tilak, we use that mantra. When somebody comes, when we tie the red thread, if a student comes, we'll use that mantra. I am surrendering to you. And that is our Kundalini, who always does auspicious and good things for us.

So even when I put this Tilak on my head, I say the same mantra. I address my Kundalini. If I put Tilak on your forehead, I address your Kundalini: that you exist in this body, so please give all the auspiciousness, and let us surrender to you. And it works. From that Durga Saptashati in the Devi Bhagavati, we get a lot of things.

Many women do not have a child. So when they go to her, she gives them water and tells them, "Go and read this one chapter of the Devi Bhagavati." It's about Shashti Devi. And in Baroda, in a couple of years, seven or eight couples who were childless all had a child, baby boys. And many, many people go and ask. Now, when we came here, somebody said many girls are unmarried. She said, "Yes, there is a chapter called Mangal Chandi. Read that Mangal Chandi and your marriage will come into the pipeline." See, all that knowledge is there.

Even the Devi Bhagavati has Ayurveda knowledge. Long time ago, I read that in one chapter it is narrated what kind of vegetables you should not eat, and in what kind of weather you should avoid certain things and eat certain things. A whole Ayurveda chapter is there. By eating certain things in certain weather, your body will generate more cough. When cough is generated, it's generated in this area. First, cough comes here, and then it grows in the pipe and starts blocking the nose. But before it blocks the nose, it also goes up and it covers our chakras. Between the chakras and our skin, that is the area where cough grows more. And with a dull-brained child, you have to think, this child is dull, this child definitely has a cough problem. Ask the mother, "Does this child have a cough problem?" And the mother says, "Yes, yes, yes. When this child was small, the child had a cough problem." Why? That cough has dried, and all the nerves are covered with that cough. When it is covered with cough, that child is dull. And that is narrated in the Devi Bhagavati. I was so surprised.

We think the Devi Bhagavati is just knowledge of the Devi—stories of Mahishasura being killed, Raktabija being killed, and how they fought with this and that weapon. When I first started reading, I said, "This is all rubbish," because we had all these books. I told my mother, "Why are you reading this?" She said, "You will read and you will get something." So I read it through a couple of times and didn't want to read it again. But out of curiosity, I went through it again and I found this knowledge. And that has impressed me: Ayurveda knowledge in the Devi Bhagavati. Again, in the Shiva Purana and different Puranas, there is a chapter of Ayurveda. The old yogis have not given it all in one text, but in different texts, so no one can manipulate it, hiding it under the stories of gods and goddesses. The Devi Bhagavati itself is a complete knowledge.

If you have plants in the garden and you give them vibrations, they are different. The plants you have not given vibrations to are different. Sometimes when we buy flowers and put them in front of Mother's altar, they grow very big. And sometimes a flower remains fresh for a month. Recently we were in the Vashi Centre, and somebody brought a little video. There was a very old Sahaja Yogi, he is not with us anymore, Mr. Thomas. He was a fisherman. He had one adopted daughter in Austria. When she went to see her mother, she took one rose from Austria to offer her. She put it on Mother's feet. It's been one and a half years, and still, that rose is fresh, like you just picked it from the plant. The vibrations have kept it. Everybody who visits takes a picture of that rose.

So that tells us a lot of things. Equip yourself. Go on higher and higher. Once you are set, the opening of the Kundalini is forever. If you do what we are teaching—because that is my personal experience—your Sahasrara will be open 24 hours. If it is not open, the category of your Sahasrara, your awareness, will be 24 hours sitting here, watching everything, becoming a witness. You enter the witness state. You will enjoy this life. Everything will be enjoyed. But you will not say, "me," "my." It's very superficial. It's senseless. But because we are tied up in these bodies and these connections, you address this as "me." You are in that awareness of the Almighty's all-pervading power, and it is possible. It is not impossible. You are connected. If you are connected, that system is working through you 24/7. It is working through me.

There was a Sahaja Yogini, an English Sahaja Yogini who got Realization. They didn't know anything about chakras or anything. And Shri Mataji told this Yogini that she had "pinned" her Kundalini so it wouldn't come down. Why? I tell you, Shri Mataji has worked that way with certain people because in their previous lives they were realized and evolved souls. So Mataji has used that technique to make them an instrument. Shri Mataji used to say, "I need an instrument. I need a good system of chakras." She doesn't care if it's a drug addict or who it is. If that system is working, she used to work with that instrument. That's how she has chosen certain instruments. When your station comes on this Sahaja journey, you get out of the train, and the train goes on. Many come in and they exit. It means their destination has come, and they have to go and work it out further. Complete knowledge is given. It is equipped in your Kundalini. The more we upload, the more we clear our Kundalini—this is the way we can clear our past. Only this is the way. You are unwinding the tape again and again. One little bubble comes out, and in a few months, you will see you will never remember your past much. Any Sahaja event, you will remember.

Now, Bhai is losing her present memory, but her past memories are intact. Yesterday we did not have lunch, but in the evening, she said, "Did we have lunch?" One day in Vashi, in the morning, we both had tea. After one hour, the man came to take the tray, and Bhai told him, "No, you are not going to take the tray. I haven't had my tea." I said, "Bhai, you did have it." "No, I didn't drink my tea." One day, we had lunch. Dr. Motu said, "You are making Bhai suffer, not having your food." So I said, "Bhai, come and eat quickly." We went to the hall, and at 11:30, Bhai said, "There is no food. Where is the food?" I said, "Bhai, we have eaten." "No, we haven't eaten." I said, "Okay, Bhai, today we have no food. We are going to sleep." So memory is now coming and going. But her back memory is very good.
