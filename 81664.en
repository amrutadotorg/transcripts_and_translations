Namaste Rameshbhai, Jai Shri Mataji. Namaste Sankarji. Namaste Bhaiya, Namaste.

So, this is a photo of Shri Mataji as Shri Shailaputri. This puja was done in the village of Naddi in Himachal Pradesh in 1985. For the first time for this interview, thank you very much, is my husband who Shri Mataji married us. So he's here, and with his dear friend, Sir Ramesh Chand, who is the headmaster of the village primary school in Burnett. And he was a young boy at what was the beginning of the International Sahaj Public School at that point.

So Rameshbhai, if I could please request you to talk to us about your memory of Shri Mataji in this photo, where she's wearing this garland with the arms and armaments of Shri Shailaputri?

Oh, yes, I can remember. I was a six-year-old boy, and I was also in a school which Yogi Mahajanji started in Dalek. It was a small school that started in one room, or maybe two or three rooms, not more than that. I was just enrolled in that school. And during those days, I remember Shri Mataji came to this place. It was springtime, I think. Yes, I guess it was springtime.

When we heard that Shri Mataji was coming here in Naddi, or especially to Talnu where Yogi Mahajanji's place was—it was his place, actually. Still is, I think.

It is, yes.

And then we all got excited. All the young children of the village—not only the young ones, everyone. I think the old people, the young, we all gathered there in the cottage. We actually waited for Shri Mataji for one hour, and then she arrived. It was a new thing for the whole village since it was a remote village during those days. We had very little contact with people from outside.

On those days, people were still... I think in Naddi, people still believe in God. We have lots of faith in God and goddesses. If you are in Himachal, it is called Dev Bhumi, which means "land of God and goddesses." So we still have this in our minds. We were totally unaware of these kinds of things, but when we heard all this, we all got excited. I can remember being a young boy, I was also excited to see Shri Mataji.

I saw lots of people not only from this village but from other surrounding places. There was a huge rush. I've never seen such a great number of people in one place in those days. So we were all very excited and we were in the front row because we were students of that school, which was run by Sahaja Yoga. Probably it was run by Yogi Mahajanji, and since he was a Sahaja Yogi, that's why I think Shri Mataji came there.

When we saw Shri Mataji coming, we all got very fascinated and were very surprised to see her. We had never seen such a person, a lady with a kind of brightness on her face. The whole aura was looking very different to us, very charming, very attractive. I have never seen such a person in my whole life. So this is what I can remember.

And then the girls of the village, they prepared special garlands for Shri Mataji from the flowers.

So the garland that she's wearing here, in this photo. Tell us something about it.

They were prepared by the local girls, and even my elder sister was also involved in that. So, it was quite an event for us. Since we were not Sahaja Yogis, it fascinated us, and it was quite amazing. I can remember that everyone was very happy on that day, seeing Shri Mataji.

Wow. Very, very nice to hear that. You were there as a young boy, five or six years old, seeing Shri Mataji as the Adi Shakti. Now, the cottage where this puja happened has been very nicely kept as a sort of a museum, as a tribute to Shri Mataji. The sari that she wore, the sari that's here, the bangles, the ornaments are on display because they emit vibrations, the positive energy. For Sahaja Yogis like us, we go from all over the world to just meditate and feel the joy of being in the lap of the Himalayas, where you are so fortunate that you were born there and are living there. It's like swimming in vibrations, actually. And you have that faith in God Almighty, of course.

So when we were looking at these things, and this is where I'd like my husband Shankarji to... you remember when we saw the bangles that Shri Mataji is wearing? They were really quite small bangles. They're still in the museum on display, and the size of the bangles was very small. You had a question about it? Or an incident to recollect?

Well, of course, I wasn't there in 1985. I was leading quite a decadent life at university back here in England. Of course, I hadn't found Shri Mataji then or gotten my self-realization with my Kundalini being awoken. But yes, 1985. Don't quote me on this, but my understanding is that after the puja to Shri Mataji as Shri Shailaputri, the daughter of the Himalayas, the Sahaja Yogis noticed that Shri Mataji appeared very small, like a young girl. And from what I had heard, the Sahaja Yogis that were present asked Shri Mataji why she was appearing so small.

Her reply was something along the lines that in the Himalayas, which would have been behind her—because if you step out of that cottage, there is the Dhauladhar Himalayan range—she commented that there were yogis, saints, and their state of evolution was so high that they themselves were able to absorb the vibrations she emitted during the puja. Because when one does puja to a highly evolved being, an incarnation, that being emits vibrations. The chakras, the subtle system of that being, the deities sitting on the chakras of Shri Mataji were delighted and pleased at human beings doing puja to her. So then her deities became excited, and as such, her physical and subtle being emitted vibrations.

And then she said something like, the yogis in the mountains were deep enough in their meditation to absorb her vibrations better than her own devotees, the Sahaja Yogis that were sitting in front of her. I don't think there would have been many Sahaja Yogis then in 1985. But that's why she appeared small, because her vibrations had been absorbed by these highly evolved yogis in the Himalayas behind her there. So it's quite fascinating to hear.

And I remember, Rameshbhai, it might have been on my last visit to you and the International Sahaj Public School, which is next door to that cottage, that traditional Himachali structure, a lovely building. It might have been my last visit there, and when I saw you, you and I went into the cottage and we walked around. We saw the... really, when you go inside, it's like a mandir. It's a temple, isn't it? We saw Shri Mataji’s throne and the photograph of her from the puja, this photograph, displayed there. And then I kind of left you for a while, and you started to walk around the exhibition part of the building. You were looking at this photograph and other photographs from different angles. And when I rejoined you, I remember you saying, "Yes, I remember this." So just go back to you now, Ramesh. Maybe that will jog your memory a little more about you being a student at Shri Mataji’s school and the puja. Have you any more to tell us from memory?

Yes. When you took me to that exhibition hall, it wasn't in my mind that the photos would be of that puja where I was also a part of that program. But when I saw Shri Mataji’s images, especially these garlands, I certainly realized that this had happened here. Before this, I thought maybe this exhibition was of her visits to foreign countries. But when I saw this, it certainly clicked in my mind that, oh, it is of those days.

And then I realized one thing is there in this image, which you pointed out, that Shri Mataji is looking smaller. When you explained this, I can remember that when Shri Mataji arrived, she was looking huge, actually. Because I was a little boy, probably it is in my mind that a lady wearing a white sari was bigger than the others. I can still imagine it. But if you see this image, she is certainly looking small. When you explain this, I mean, it probably is the right thing. But when I saw Shri Mataji sitting on that chair that time, it wasn't in my mind. As a little boy, you cannot recognize all these things.

Of course. Tell us something about your time in that school when it was there in Dalek. I'm going to stop sharing the screen now.

Yes, it was... I got admitted in that school along with a few of my friends, and I was a good student. What happened was, I went there for four or five months, maybe six months. And then there was a little hike in the school fee. So my grandmother went to Yogi Mahajanji, and she told him that we cannot pay this. I don't know how much it was, maybe 10 or 20 rupees. So then Yogi-ji maybe suggested she could enroll me in a government school. So I went there.

But meanwhile, until I was there, I had joined a few puja sessions in the cottage. Maybe they were organized by Deepa Mahajan, his wife, or once I joined his session also. In that puja session, we had to do Aarti and a few other things.

What was the school session like?

It was 10 to 3, I think. Our session, as happens in Himachal, maybe from April to March, but I was not there for the full session. Since I was very young, I don't remember much. But I remember one of the teachers, when they realized I was going to another school, they asked me, "Don't go. We will not let you go." I remember one of the foreigner teachers was there. She came for a few days, but there was a communication gap, so we gave her a tough time. Poor lady. Our Indian teachers used to scold us sometimes, but that lady never did. But we gave her trouble, especially when she took us to Dalek. If she managed one group, then another group would go another way. This is what I have to say. But I think that was a nice school. School is always nice. So yes, that was nice for me.

Were there any Western pupils there when you were there on those days?

No, no one. It was started with the locals, actually.

And as you know, Susmita Didi and I lived and worked at the current ISPS, International Sahaj Public School, in a much, much bigger campus, just tucked around the side of the mountain that Naddi village is on, just around from the Naddi village bus stop and right next to the cottage. Do you have any memories of when that bigger campus was being constructed and seeing Western children? Maybe you might even have known some of the Indian teachers at that new campus?

Yes. After Dalek, they started building the school, I think in the nineties. Maybe in the early nineties, they started the construction. A few of the teachers who were in that school continued there in the new school. So I knew a few of them also. They are retired now, I think. I haven't seen them for quite a while.

I have seen the school grow. Once there were like three or four hundred students, and most of them were from foreign countries, either from Europe, Australia, from all over the world. Probably they are all the devotees of Shri Mataji.

Yes, that's the prerequisite for the school.

And since I am in a teaching profession and working in a government school, I can say this is probably the best school in Dharamshala. I can say that. If someone wants to send their kids there, it's the best one. No doubt. They look after the children very well. I can say this since I've been watching it for all those years. So, it's the best, still the best school in Dharamshala, or in our district.

Because your school, of which you are the headmaster, is quite lower down the same mountain, past Stolbury, in the village of Barnett, isn't it?

Yes. The headteacher of the primary school of the village.

We've been very lucky to have been able to visit a few times now, actually. Even with your auntie and uncle in 2014. And you said that ISPS is arguably the best school in that area of Dharamshala. How do the villagers, the Naddi villagers, view the school, ISPS, and the cottage? I know they hold Yogi Mahajanji in very high regard.

The villagers have lots of respect towards this family—Yogi Mahajanji and his family. We all respect the whole family. And if you talk about the school, locals cannot enroll their children because it's a little expensive for them. But still, locals are happy with this institution because most of the locals are getting employed there. From that place. This could be one reason also.

And the meditation center, I have seen people go there to meditate. And if one joins that center for a month or so, or 15 days, you can see the changes. In the mountains, people are often habitual smokers and drinkers, and this is prohibited over there. I respect this institution because of this also. If you are following them, then you are away from these things, which is a good thing. I think we should have these kinds of institutions everywhere to save people.

I just remembered that your youngest sister, Sapna, went to this meditation center at the cottage, and she meditates as well.

Yes. Yes.

Because when we celebrated our daughter's birthday at your place when we were in COVID, she was telling me about it. I didn't know that.

Yes. Because Didi and I, as I said, we lived and worked there for four years. It was a huge blessing for us. For me as a Westerner, ignorant of the blissful—although at the same time, very harsh—environment of that Dhauladhar range, Naddi village, and Dharamshala. I remember the torrential monsoonal rain, the bitter cold with some snowfall. For a Westerner, going and living there for four years was pretty tough.

At the same time, I could feel the divinity of the Himalayas and that particular place. My limited understanding of it is that Talnu is the Brahmarandra, the soft spot of the fontanel bone area when one was a baby, which later calcifies with the formation of the ego and our conditions. To be there as a Westerner for four years, really bathed in these divine vibrations of the Himalayas and being able to meditate there, it really boosted my spiritual ascent in this life. Not that I've gotten very high anyway.

But it was great. We used to go and cut wood in the jungle. We brought our dogs over from England to be there. I had the good blessing of being able to teach English language and English literature. Our children were there. Vinay, our son, was there for 10 years, and Shudevi for 12 years. And of course, it gave us this wonderful opportunity to get to know some of the Naddi village people, the Gaddi people. Yourself and your good wife, Lakshmi, included. And the girls. And to have that insight into how the Gaddi people are: very warm, very hospitable, very loving, very accommodating. And all set against this quite harsh mountain backdrop.

For Indians, to go to the Himalayas is like a pilgrimage. And some sannyasis who renounce household life go there to perform tapas and penance to please God, or as the Hindus would say, Shri Shiva. It's a wonderful place, and it's so good to know you and to listen to your memories.

I think, are you going to show a clip of Shri Mataji at Dal Lake?

Yes, so I'll just show you this video of Shri Mataji from a public program that she gave to the people of Naddi, Talnu village, and thereabouts in 1985. So, I'll share.
