 (England)
Face completely. Everybody, let's please raise our kundalini before we proceed further, with our attention on Sahasrara.

Thank you once again for joining us, Graham, Gail, and Felicity. Felicity, thank you for arranging this morning's interview session. I know you worked incredibly hard to get everyone together for this time, with all the lovely details you're going to share of your times with Shri Mataji.

We understand, Graham and Gail, we interviewed you back in 2010 when we did the Golden Memory session. Would you please remind us... I mean, it's so nice and such a privilege to have two educationists, Graham and Felicity, and a medical professional, Gail, with us. They will join us today to tell us about their time with Shri Mataji back in the 1980s.

Graham, would you like to start, please, with where you were and how you got your realization?

Graham: Absolutely. I was living in Hampstead in 1980 and I was invited to go along to the Friends Meeting House in Hampstead. That was where I met Shri Mataji first of all. I do remember on that occasion that she just walked into the room in a white sari, and it was a fantastic, dynamic program. I got my realization, and after that, I was completely blown away for about a week. I remember going up onto Hampstead Heath every day and just lying on the ground looking at the sky. I couldn't work, I couldn't do anything, but it was a very powerful experience for me.

Subsequent to that, I gradually got into Sahaja Yoga and I went to the Caxton Hall meetings, which of course had started earlier. I remember going to those wonderful Monday programs. I do remember on one occasion that Shri Mataji asked for all the lights in the building to be switched off, and then she just held a candle and all you could see was her face. Afterwards, some of the staff at the Caxton Hall wanted to put the lights on, but dear Cooley was having to fight them off to stop them from actually doing this. It was a very dramatic thing.

Then various other things happened. I remember at Caxton Hall that we went to McDonald's afterwards and sat down there. I think it was potentially because Shri Mataji wanted to help Linda, who'd been very, very vegetarian. So we started to eat hamburgers, and she was very happy and jolly, sitting in a booth with the yogis. It was just amazing how easily she adapted from being the speaker at Caxton Hall to being just our Mother, really, and being happy to be with us.

Host: Graham, please remind us, was this meeting at the Friends Meeting House on Hampstead, and when was it?

Graham: This was in February 1980; I got my realization then. Hester and maybe Magda and David were running the meetings. I think he was saying recently how Magda had looked after you and you'd visited.

Felicity: Yes, afterwards I used to go and see her at her house. And Dania and Caleb were there, of course. They're a very lovely, kind family and made me feel very easy to be with them.

Graham: And then eventually, I was invited to move down to Chelsham Road. I thought, "Oh, wow, this is such a great opportunity." So when I moved into Chelsham Road, Linda had more or less just purchased the property, and it was like stepping into a whole different world altogether. It was like a huge bubble full of vibrations.

Host: And when was this?

Graham: This was in about May or June 1980. I moved in there, and we were still having Caxton Hall meetings. Around on Friday evenings, Mother would come, and we'd give her a cup of tea and she'd have a meal. Then she'd give a lovely talk to us, and then we'd all go to her feet and she'd work on each individual yogi. It was absolutely amazing. Life from then on turned out to be eating, working, sleeping, and Sahaja Yoga. It was a complete bubble of vibrations, and it was almost like the rest of the world didn't exist.

Host: The essence of this interview that you've so beautifully put, because we're trying to get to those times that you have enjoyed as yogis in the physical presence of Shri Mataji. So it's really beautiful that you're so forthcoming and beautifully describing it. Please carry on.

Graham: Well, yes. Gavin was the leader of the UK at the time, and he invited me to go and work with him at his geological information service. So, I used to sometimes get phone calls from Shri Mataji for Gavin. At first, I would be just taking the call and then passing it on, but gradually Mother said to me, "Who is this? Who are you?" So I said, "My name's Graham." And she said, "Oh, right, Graham. Could you just pass this message on to Gavin?" Gradually, she would talk to me and give me the information, and then I’d give it to Gavin. So it was really lovely to actually have that sort of contact with her, rather than being someone that I only saw sitting on the stage at Caxton Hall. It was becoming a closer kind of familiarity and relationship with her.

And I do remember in the early days, Felicity—I shouldn't forget you—that you were living in Hampstead at the same time. I remember going around to your flat, and you had this huge picture of Shri Mataji on the wall. You invited me to listen to a tape recording of Shri Mataji. So I put the headphones on, and I was listening. Then halfway through, Mother started declaring that she was the Holy Spirit. I was just amazed. I thought, how can I go back after all this? This was a real turning point for me because I was beginning to see the grandeur of this whole thing. Even from that tape recording, it was a moment for me.

So, life continued on at the ashram. Back to Chelsham Road, we would have Mother's attention totally on us all the time. We'd get up at four o'clock in the morning, do puja, read the 108 names or something like that, do the arti, and then we'd have breakfast. This was every day. Then we'd go off to work, come back home, someone would make a meal—we had rotas and things like that—and then we would work on ourselves in the evening. I can remember sessions of using the burnt onions on the Agnya, and people working with candles. It was very, very intense, but fantastic, actually. So we were all getting deeper and deeper into Sahaja Yoga. And of course, Mother coming on Fridays was very much the icing on the cake, or the cake itself, I should probably say.

On one occasion, it was very interesting just to show how natural Shri Mataji was. She decided we wanted to have an ajwain session. So we found all these sheets, and with Mother, we were sitting on the floor in the front room, all of us with sheets over us, with all of this ajwain smoke coming up and filling us up. It was so amazing and intense. I believe someone had to open the window in the kitchen to let the smoke out, and some neighbors saw this smoke pouring out of the windows and called the fire brigade. They turned up knocking on the door, and then we said, "Oh no, no, no, it's quite all right. It's just a little bit of incense, no worries, no problems, don't worry." So off they went again. But it was just that lovely familiarity and surprise, doing things like that for Shri Mataji.

Host: So this was at Chelsham Road. It is said that after an ajwain treatment, you don't go outside bareheaded, you cover your head or something?

Graham: That's right, we got the instructions that you should wrap up and not go out. I think it was really working on our Vishuddhis. So that was just one example of how Mother was looking after us collectively. She was really establishing Sahaja Yoga. It was like she was the mothership, and we were all these other little craft following along at the same time. Beautiful.

And then gradually, we moved on to the marriages that came along in 1981. Before that, I should say that part of our regime was to find somebody in the country who was running a public program. Some of the yogis, including myself, would go off and they'd have a program on the Saturday evening, and then on the Sunday, we'd have a puja with them and then come back to Chelsham Road and start all over again.

On one of those occasions, I met Gail, who was running a program, I believe in Sheffield.

Gail: Yes. So that's where you got your realization? I got my realization in Sheffield, but I came in January 1981. There wasn't really a lot of Sahaja Yogis around in those days, but the Harris family were there for some of the time, and I sort of knew them and they were very, very supportive. Also, John Glover's father lived there, so he would come as well, and Paul Winter, I think, was there for a time. So people came and went. We were all kind of very young. I was 23 when I got my realization. So when I think back now, that's very young, isn't it?

Host: Yes, it is. In today's parlance, it is a child, actually.

Gail: Yes, I know. After getting my realization, I didn't meet Mother initially. I got my realization from that lovely black and white standard photograph. I met Mother for the first time in Chelsham Road, as it were, on Sahasrara Day 1981. Wow, that was amazing. Because I'd been meditating on the photograph, Mother had been in India and Australia, and she came back. I went down from Sheffield to London to see Mother. It was my first puja and my first meeting of Mother, and it was quite overwhelming.

I remember Mother walking into the meditation room at Chelsham Road, and she had on a headscarf. She was like this little Indian lady, and in my meditation, she'd been so vast and so big. I remember thinking, "Oh..." But of course, Mother was very large. It was just this little illusion.

Host: Yes, the Mahamaya. We'd like to bring in Felicity here because we want to talk about the ashram. You've been talking about, Graham, the Chelsham Road ashram. But I believe Felicity and you met before Gail and you got married. What was ashram life like, and where and when was it? Please, either of you who wants to speak, take the lead.

Felicity: Well, I think Graham has given such a good introduction. Everything, each ashram was unique and different in its running. So as he said, we met in Hampstead. I was living there too, in a rooming house. This time it was very sweet to hear your memories; I had not heard those before. I had a tiny room that was only room for a bed, a bedside table, and I think there was a cupboard next to the door. Then there was this passageway beside the bed. But then I had a lot of pictures of Mother on the walls, which was really like a shrine.

This is in 1981. My dates have got a little bit confused because I moved from that place into Warwick Road. So as Graham was in Chelsham Road, the collective had grown a lot and we needed more ashrams. There was only a finite number of rooms in Chelsham Road. Jason was working for the council, and he worked it out that at that time in London there were many big, old houses that were empty. The council was keen to have them occupied so that squatters wouldn't live there for free, not always looking after the place. So the council was quite keen that Jason proposed that he had this group of good people who would occupy these houses and take care of them for a limited amount of time. And that's what happened.

So we were given the use of this house in Warwick Road, which is just past the Earl's Court station, on the backside leading on to Cromwell Road. It was one of those very four-story, "upstairs, downstairs" houses. We were in one of those. And then we were given this hotel in Bramham Gardens. So we had those two at the same time.

My story about the setting up of Warwick Road was, I remember Mother calling for people who wanted to live in an ashram, and a list was made with names on it. I remember thinking, "Oh, I'm not going to get in because my vibrations aren't very good, and Mother will choose them on vibrations." Then, much to my surprise, we were sitting there with her when she started to go through the list. Whoever was reading the list would say a name, and I remember when they got to me, Mother was practical. She said, "Oh yes, yes, she's in this rooming house," like she should have a room. That really surprised me, that very practical aspect. That was the beginnings. I kept being surprised because we knew who Mother was—she was the goddess, God Almighty—but she was so practical, so down to earth. From the list, I think everybody got placed. She just said they will go to Warwick Road, they will go to Bramham Gardens.

Host: And then we'll go back to the marriages because I do remember...

Graham: What I do remember, sort of building up to the marriages, was that day by day, more and more couples would seem to be becoming part of this grand marriage ceremony. I can remember, I believe we were traveling with Shri Mataji down to a Bath seminar or program.

Gail: Wasn't that the one that was at your house?

Felicity: Yes, I was just going to say. So, were you at the "Open Your Heart" Mill Farm seminar, Graham?

Graham: Yes, yes.

Felicity: Because after the puja on the Sunday, Shri Mataji came down on the Sunday morning for the puja. We had the puja, then she sat there and started to matchmake. I remember sitting there and she said... Because someone said Jason and Jill want to get matched. So that was all going on. And I was looking at the dates. That was the Sunday. The week later, the following Sunday, the marriages took place in Chelsham Road. So only a week before, some matches may have already been arranged, but these matches were going ahead.

Graham: A fascinating part of the whole proceedings was that I remember being on the train with Shri Mataji, and she asked Pamela, "Oh, who was the name of that girl who lived in Sheffield?" And Pamela said, "Oh, it's Gail." Then Mother turned around to me and she said, "Graham, you want to marry Gail?" I had never thought about getting married at all. Wow. So then she said, "You must phone her up, you must phone her up." And so I said, "Yes, Mother, yes, Mother." And then a few days later, Mother was, "Have you phoned her? Have you phoned her up?" I said, "I'm sorry, no I haven't."

Gail: I think in the end, Mother sent Pamela to phone me because, as Felicity alluded to, there was a very short timeframe for this. So I then got a phone call from Pam who said, "Oh hello, it's Auntie Pam." And I said hello. And she said, "I'm phoning you from Mother's house," which was just amazing. She said, "Do you know Graham?" And I did, because you'd come down for the program in Sheffield, so I knew who you were. And she said, "Oh well, Mother suggested a match for you with Graham, a marriage match." And then she said, "So what should I tell Mother?"

In those days, we knew who Mother was, and I didn't sort of think. If Mother says, then we must do. So I said, "Well, you must tell her yes." And I remember at that moment, I felt my kundalini come up so strongly. I don't think I've ever had it come up that strong ever since. It was just amazing. And then she went, "Oh well, thank you, I'll go and tell Mother."

Graham: And then of course you did phone me after that. I think Mother was thinking, because I had three days to get to London for my marriage.

Gail: That's right.

Graham: And I remember calling her and inviting her down. We met at King's Cross, we had a cup of coffee, and I think, well, we should get married, what do you think?

Host: Was it an awkward conversation or did it just flow?

Graham: It just flowed, and she was so positive about it.

Gail: I remember saying to Gavin, "Okay, we're going to get married." And he said, "Great, that makes 16 couples for the Krishna Puja."

Graham: And that's how it rolled up into the wonderful day at Chelsham Road when all the marriages took place.

Host: Should we share the photos of the wedding?

Gail: It was a very small garden, I have to say, at the back of Chelsham Road ashram. And it was amazing that all of these marriages... I've been back since and I've looked at that garden and thought, "How did that happen?" Because we were all sitting in the garden, like the other yogis, and there must have been at least 50 of us.

Felicity: It was incredible how everybody fit. With great wonderment, thinking, "How did all that happen?"

Graham: We had one havan at the bottom of the garden that all the 16 couples had to walk around. We didn't have individual havans like they do now. There was one large fire ceremony. And there was this one very interesting pujari who was an Indian man who'd been invited. And he would be going through the ceremony of the marriage, and Shri Mataji continually interrupted saying, "No, no, no, no, it should be like this, it should be like that." So it became very comical, actually, but in a nice way, of course. I've never seen Mother so happy. She was roaring with laughter. It was an absolute wonder to see her.

Gail: That was the haldi ceremony. Yes, we had the haldi ceremony. And it was fantastic.

[Viewing photos]

Gail: This is a lovely picture of Mother at the wedding. That's Olympia's daughter. And the cake on the right, beautiful wedding cake. Yes, so this is Mother just inside the French doors of the meditation room. Poor Gregoire, wearing a wonderful white suit, of course it ended up completely yellow. I remember him fighting with people to stop them putting haldi on him, but unsuccessfully, bless him. And I do remember Mother was just sitting in a chair in the garden during the haldi ceremony, and she laughed a lot. It was a very joyful moment. All the couples actually went to her feet and she blessed all the couples.

Host: What was Mother's advice to these 16 couples that were getting married? Because she used to give these talks to the bride and to the groom.

Gail: I'm looking at Amruta, and on the same day, it's got "Marriages, 9th of August," and then it has "Talk to Sahaja Yogis: Establishing Your Marriage" on the same day.

Graham: I think it must be after the marriages Mother spoke to everyone. We were sitting down outside at Chelsham Road and Mother came and spoke to us all.

Host: That's a picture of you, Gail and Graham. That's so beautiful, that photo. So sweet to see how young we all were.

Gail: The oldest people at that time in 1981 were probably Gavin and his wife, who were in their 40s. Douglas was in his 40s. Gregoire must have been in his late 20s or 30s. And all the rest of us were just in our mid-20s. This is after the ceremony, and this is when we all sat down and Mother gave her talk.

Graham: Subsequent to all this, of course, all the married couples and Sir C.P. all moved to Bramham Gardens.

Gail: It's worth saying that this was the first really large marriage ceremony in Sahaj.

Felicity: Thanks for sharing all these photos, Gail. And Felicity, you'd catalyzed it all. Thank you all.

Gail: Shri Mataji and Sir C.P. moved into the basement area of this hotel. We went there directly from the marriage. A lot of the couples and some other people were then living in Bramham Gardens, and Mother was renovating the house she had bought in Brompton Square. I don't think she was there immediately after the weddings, but quite soon after, because there was a lot of building work going on at Brompton Square.

Graham: I do remember they were actually living at Bramham. There was a period before they moved into Brompton Square where it wasn't actually livable, so much building work was going on. But we had a front room at Bramham Gardens, and Mother used to come up there and all the yogis would sit and we'd have collective meditation sessions with her.

Gail: And that's where, if you look on Amruta, you can see there are four talks, well, not just talks but sessions, very close to each other around Diwali puja. And there's that very famous now practical session where she shows the different asanas for clearing Mooladhara and Swadishthana.

Graham: Yes, and the pranas and the manas. Something I'd written down about that, because it was an amazing session and I was there.

Host: Please do, please do.

Gail: I put "Wednesday the 28th," so that must have been 1981, just at Diwali time. "Mother comes into the meditation room in the late morning. There are about 14 of us. She talks to us about the left side and how we should throw away all our 'hippiness,' because we were often looking like hippies in those days, and we should get some smart clothes, etc. And then Mother explains some exercises to us for the Mooladhara and Swadishthan, which I believe are filmed, and advises most strongly to correct our posture to balance right and left sides, to walk well. Then we all take candles and Mother most graciously works on our left side. Then we take a candle at the back of another person and work out the chakras, particularly back Agnya and left Vishuddhi." And that was just something I wrote down about that session at the time.

Felicity: There's another one where for the first 10 minutes she's basically waiting for people. I remember we got this call from Warwick Road to go to Bramham Gardens, as Mother's going to speak tonight. We were very close, either side of Earl's Court Road. So it was in the evening, it must have been like six o'clock or something, and she's sitting there, and if you watch it, you'll see she says, "Is so-and-so coming?" People are saying, "Oh yes, Pat's coming from work," and she literally just makes conversation for about 10-15 minutes, talking about the America tour. And gradually people are coming in, and then she says, "Okay, I think we're here now, let's start." So that makes you realize how important these talks were. She was creating a special time that she could share what she wanted us to learn.

We didn't know very much at all. Let's be honest, we'd come into Sahaja Yoga and now we know so much through Mother's knowledge that she's given us, but in those very early days, we knew very little. Everything Mother was telling us was like a revelation.

Host: Would you remind us of the dates of these talks?

Felicity: So, the first one in Warwick Road is in July. Then almost immediately, 10 days after that, we have the seminar in Mill Farm. Then we have the marriages the following weekend with the talk. Then she goes off to Birmingham, comes back, we have Caxton Hall, and then she goes to Switzerland for the weekend, comes back, and then we get, on the 4th of September, "Advice on a Seminar." And then she's back at Caxton Hall, and then Mother goes off to America. She's away for a whole month.

She comes back again, and now we're into October. You see on the 27th of October, a Diwali Puja talk. This is like a pre-puja talk, "Lakshmi Principle." Then two days later, another talk in Bramham Gardens, "You Must Grow Fast." And before the Diwali talk, there's the practical session on the 29th. Then there's the puja three days later at Chelsham Road, and then two days later again, there's the talk at Bramham Gardens. Then Mother goes off to Italy, and a month later, on the 7th of December, she's doing the housewarming puja at Brompton Square. And then it's Christmas.

That just gives you a sense of how, like Graham was saying, it was very intense. It was absolutely jam-packed. Not just jam-packed for Mother, but jam-packed for us. Like somebody said to me recently, "Oh well, why didn't you go out to have coffee and things like that?" I said that was not in any of our attention at the time. Like Graham said, your whole life was centered on clearing, going deeper, understanding what Mother was saying. When she goes up to Birmingham, she says, "You are in a war." That was kind of the atmosphere, a sense of urgency that we had to establish it. It was the most important thing.

And for her also, the marriages. That's what Mother started to make clear in her talks, how important the Sahaj marriages were, because she was waiting for the born-realized children. She was waiting for all those souls to be born who were going to come into the world and kind of take over from us. We were the instruments for their entry into the world. She's establishing a Sahaj culture. This is the beginning for us of a complete detachment from what life was going to be like in the UK. She made a whole new world for us, and we all were participants in that.

Graham: And don't forget, with these public programs going on all over London as well. I do remember one at Vauxhall which I'd like to mention, where it just demonstrated Mother's ability to use totally different techniques. She was always experimenting. At this particular meeting, after the talk, we'd have the realization, and then she'd come down from the stage and walk around the people. I remember her throwing vibrated water onto people's Sahasraras, and she said, "Look, look, it's really working!" She would always be so flexible about what she did.

Felicity: I remember when, because in those days, you have to imagine there was no internet, nothing. I was trying to think of ways that we could advertise that we're having programs. I was in this post office and I saw it had a little notice board, so I made a little postcard-sized advertisement with a picture on it. So I showed this to Mother. This is like a bit earlier, like in 1980 or late 1979. I took it to Shri Mataji and was asking, "Do you think we could do this?" I always expected that she would give direction or she would say yes or no, like a teacher-guru thing. And she just said to me, "Oh, try it and see. Try it and see if it works."

That was so much of the early years, how, as Graham said, she was just trying all these different things. So sometimes, you know, some things that we did then eventually got changed a little bit over the years. We used to clear by putting our left hand to Mother and the right hand outside the window, moving into the air. Now we don't do that; we clear onto the earth.

Graham: I do remember clearing to the fire. Stick with your left hand to Mother and the right hand towards the fire to actually clear out the left side, using the fire element as well.

Gail: Mother asked me to put my right hand to the candle one time.

Felicity: Which now people say, "Oh, you should only put your left hand to the candle." But Mother said at that point, to me, at that moment, "Put your right hand to the candle." I think that's very important, because I was in the room when Mother said to one of the yogis, "You have a bad liver, you shouldn't eat oranges." And then literally a few months later, I was in a different room with different yogis, and Mother said to this yogi, "You should eat oranges, you have a bad liver."

Through these experiences, you learn that we have to be our own gurus. We have to listen to what Mother is telling us or the kundalini is telling us. One day I was actually in Washi, foot-soaking, and I felt, "Oh, you must get the candle and start candling your left side," which is a complete no-no. You're not supposed to do both at the same time. But I had such a deep and powerful experience. So it's all about being spontaneous, not being conditioned. We can't give up one set of old conditionings and develop Sahaj conditionings that block us from our growth as well.

Graham: One of the things I wanted to just say quickly was about the generosity of Mother.

Host: I was going to ask, please talk about that.

Graham: It is so important. Very often with our pujas, the pujas we were doing in this intense period, Mother would have a big bag with her. And after the puja, she would give gifts to every single person. This is an interesting picture I took at the Temple of All Faiths. I remember showing this to Mother, and she laughed. She said, "Look, English produce." But what it actually was was the Indian Sahaja Yogis sending us silver so we could do puja for Mother properly. I think we've got a photograph where we had like a plastic orange bowl for the water or something like that. Gosh, yes, what a contrast to the way the Indians were doing these things.

But one of the stories I had about the generosity of Mother was, apart from giving all the yogis little presents after the puja, she actually bought a whole pink carpet from the Houndsditch warehouse to go in Chelsham Road. She said, "Pink is the color of love." I remember going to Houndsditch with Mother in the car. I had no idea how to get there, but Mother said, "Don't worry, just follow my directions." And off we went. She said, "Turn left here, turn right there," and eventually we got there, no problem at all. I don't think Mother had ever been to Houndsditch before; she was just using divine vibrations. She used to say it's very simple traveling, you've only got to decide left or right, and that's all you have to do.

They said we could have a whole year in which to have the carpet laid, and being the yogis, I guess we were just so busy we never got around to it. It was rolled up in the meditation room, and eventually, I think we came to the last hour, literally, before the contract ran out. I remember these carpet fitters arriving at Chelsham Road, thinking, "Oh, this is a super little house, it's not going to be any problem." And then they walked into this huge meditation room with steps and things. We had to run all over the house finding all the underlay from the different rooms that people had taken. It just worked; there was enough, and these people laid that beautiful carpet. A wonderful gift.

Host: We were going to talk about the Warwick Road carpets.

Felicity: Yes, this was an example of Mother's generosity. We basically moved into this completely empty house. We all got paint and painted our own rooms. And then Mother came to visit us. She talked to us, and then she said, "I brought you some carpets." And they proceeded to roll out each carpet. They were all Persian carpets, beautiful and all different colors—red and green background colors. She would just roll one out and say, "Who would like this one?" I just remember feeling so overcome that Mother had brought these carpets for us, knowing that we were in very spartan circumstances. It took a while before I felt... different people were claiming carpets. Then I remember they rolled out this green one, and I said, "Oh, I'd like the green one, it would be lovely. Thank you, Mother." It was just very touching.

Graham: I remember that, I must have come over from Bramham Gardens because I just remember the rolling out of the carpets. It was quite dramatic; suddenly you see this beautiful pattern.

Felicity: That generosity extended into when Mother bought Cabella and the pujas moved there. In the early 80s, all the pujas would happen initially in England, and then they would go to different countries. But when she bought Cabella, everything became more centralized. As the puja would finish, the hosting countries would come up and offer their gifts, and then Mother would start distributing gifts. Those who were there would go up on the stage. They were not necessarily big gifts—it could be bangles, it could be pieces of clothing—but you were getting a gift from the Adi Shakti. And not only those who attended the puja, but also those back in the home country. The yogis would be given some gifts to take back to distribute amongst the yogis at home who'd been helping host from afar. It was a very special feeling when Mother would start distributing these gifts, and it went on for years.

Host: Is there any gift that you have to hand that you'd like to share?

Gail: We were given this, which is really beautiful. [Shows a carved wooden statue] These came from India in crates, do you remember? And they were opened, and we were in a room when they were being opened. Several yogis got them, all different statues. It's such a beautiful thing.

Graham: And when we got married, I think Mother took us down with her to Southall to actually go and buy all the jewelry for the ladies.

Gail: Tell us about it. Mother going with you in England.

Graham: Okay, we're going to go to Southall. So we got in the car and we drove down. And then she walked through, went into different shops, and she was buying all the little nose pieces and all the jewelry for the bride. It was a lovely moment.

Felicity: Kingsley and Jeremy were remembering the Guru Nanak Puja where at the end of the puja, the yogis brought boxes of gifts in little brown bags so you couldn't see what was in them. They were remembering how the men got ties, and as they brought out their tie, it matched the color of the clothes that they were wearing.

From my side of the room where I was, I was given a little... [shows a small clay oil lamp]. I don't know if you can see, but this is a little oil lamp. You pour the oil in here, and it actually has a carving on the front. I think you can see there's a wolf which is biting the left shoulder. The person next to me went, "Oh look, that's so perfect for you, they're killing the bhoots in your left Vishuddhi," because I had a very bad left Vishuddhi. And then next to me on the other side, there was a yogini, and she'd been given perfume. You could see it really touched her heart, and she said, "Oh, I know what Mother's saying to me. She's saying to me, 'You're special, you're precious, you must think well of yourself.'" And Jeremy was saying it was incredible because literally, Mother would put her hand into the box and say, "Oh, this is for so-and-so," or "Who hasn't got a present yet?" And then she would just pick out this brown bag, and it would be the right present.

Graham: I wanted to share the memory of how spontaneous Mother was. Because after one of our public programs, I think it was in Bath, we actually went off in cars to the source of the Thames.

Felicity: Oh yes, that's just down the road from us.

Graham: That's right, Seven Springs, where the source of the River Thames comes up out of the ground in seven different channels. It was amazing because Mother got out of the car, we stopped, and she walked down there with all the yogis. And then she put her feet into the water. I do remember the water started to flow more strongly. It was really quite pronounced. And I remember Rustam was there, and Jamel, and loads of people were constellated around her. But it was like one of those very significant, deep, profound moments when she was actually working on England. Here she was, Adi Shakti, with her feet in the water.

Host: Graham, talk to us about the Divine Cookbook, please.

Graham: The inspiration, funny enough, is that I thought, how would God work it out for human beings to actually get themselves into a better place? I thought that the simplest idea would be a recipe. So you'd put a few ingredients together, mix them up, and then produce this wonderful result. And I thought, "The Divine Cookbook," it had to be. It echoed "Divine Cool Breeze." I remember talking to Richard about this, and he said, "When you first write DCB, I keep thinking of Divine Cool Breeze." But I thought, no, no, it's Divine Cookbook. That was how I came to the title.

So what it was, was first of all, a kind of overview of meeting Shri Mataji and getting my realization. And then after that, I started to write poetry. So I interspersed my recollections of Mother with poems. I can read one if you like. [Shows the book layout]. All the poems have a different color page. Peter helped with the design of the book, I must say. He was very tolerant of me and very patient.

Anyway, here it is. This is called "Shri Ganesha Moment."

What is the point of thought
when the river water is rushing by?
What is the point of thought
when the sun bakes the rocks,
tickling the feet of lizards?
What is the point of thought
when the air carries the songs of birds
and our breath mingles
with the fragrance of flowers?
Shri Ganesh, only You exist
within all these things.
Only You are the witness of this play.
It is you, our mild-eyed God,
who laughs as his toes touch the water.
It is You who rides upon the mouse
that tunnels with joy at the break of day.
It is only You, Shri Ganesha,
whose eyes close
and the dream of night begins.

Host: It's really beautiful, Graham. Thank you.

Graham: So through my Sahaj life, I just kept on writing different poems, and they're interspersed in the book.

[A short video clip of a meditation session with Shri Mataji in Bramham Gardens is played.]

Host: Thank you, that was lovely. That's really amazing. And you were there.

Gail: Yes, I remember that. We were told earlier in the day that Mother would be speaking, and we had to let everybody know and make sure that everyone could come.

And so I think they were living quite spontaneously, if I may say that. It wasn't luxurious, I don't think, for them. But I think it was just this intermediate period before going to Brompton Square. I do remember being called once to help pack for the American tour, which Mother referred to just then. We were in the house and Mother sent a message upstairs with someone saying, "Are there any ladies around? I need someone to help me pack." And I think I was the only lady in at that moment. So it was quite overawing going into Mother's room.

She had this beautiful wardrobe in her bedroom, and she had in it all her saris. I started to fold the saris—just very simple, white with maybe just a border—and put them into these cases. After some time, I started to get really, really dizzy. And Mother was over the other side of the room doing something, and she suddenly looked over and said, "How are the vibrations? They're too much for you. Sit down." It was just from folding Mother's saris. I guess I was quite new to Sahaja Yoga. I only came in the January, and by this time we were only in September or November or something. It was quite a fast track for me.

Host: Which house of Shri Mataji was that, Gail?

Gail: That was in Bramham Gardens. And it was that time when you read out the itinerary at the beginning and you said Mother went to America. So that's when I was packing the saris. And then after that, Mother said, "Oh, you must have lunch." And she sent for lunch, and I actually sat down with Mother and ate lunch. It was quite overawing, but I do remember because it was like three courses. The first one was melon, and I was thinking, "Oh, I don't really like melon." But you can't refuse, can you, when the Adi Shakti offers you food. So I ate this melon, and now I love melons. And then she said, "Oh, we'll have prawns because they're quite light. And it's good to have something light in the middle of the day, isn't it?" So I remember eating some prawns and things.

Sometimes you would get a call, Mother would need something, and she would ask, "Is there anybody there who can come and do this?" I don't expect Mother really needed it. I expect she did it for our benefit completely and utterly, to help us evolve and give us more vibrations and to help our ascent. I doubt Mother really needed the help.

Felicity: We couldn't really get enough of Mother, could we? We wanted to be with her all the time.

Graham: All the time. I know. I remember going to the airport. We'd have to try and rush off from wherever we were working and get to the airport because we knew Mother's flight was coming in. That was actually a very important thing, to greet Shri Mataji as she arrived. I remember there was one occasion where it didn't happen, and she showed us that it was actually very important and auspicious that we should be there to greet her.

Felicity: It was amazing because she would accept so many flowers walking through the arrivals terminal, wouldn't she? Everybody would go with big bunches of flowers. And Mother would take everybody's flowers. "How are you? How are you?"

Gail: Yes. And I think Sir C.P. would say there are more flowers in the house than in the garden.

Graham: It's interesting what you're saying about the attention, because I do remember in Vancouver, we actually took Shri Mataji to a hotel that was a circular one that revolved around. It was the Sears Tower. So we actually got into this glass lift to go up to this top floor, and suddenly it comes out from this box and there's nothing around you. And everyone steps back, and Shri Mataji stepped back. "What's going on?" "It's okay, Mother, it's just the way they designed it." So we went up to the top floor and had a lovely lunch. And after an hour, her attention had actually been on the whole of Vancouver, the whole of the city.

Felicity: We learned in those early years, traveling with her, that she would do things that were vibrationally the right thing to do. So you learned to just go with the flow and be spontaneous and let Mother organize. Sometimes you'd have leaders or people who would try to organize Mother, and then nothing would work out. It's a good lesson for now. I think that's something that we all really learned, that Sahaja Yoga is grassroots, it's an evolutionary growth. And it's so important not to try to set down rituals. "Oh, we have to do things this way, this way, this way," because that's not how it is. We so learned that in the early years as things were growing, that you would change or you'd try this or you'd try that. And that applies today as much as it did then.

Gail: The whole point of the puja is to be cleared and to be in Sahasrara. That was the beauty of Mother's pujas. I remember these seminar weekends, you'd arrive on the Friday, everyone feeling a little bit frazzled from work, and you'd sleep over there. The next day, you'd feel the vibrations sort of building and clearing you, taking you into the Saturday evening. And then you'd get the puja on the Sunday. With those seminars, you actually felt different, like something changes in your consciousness.

Felicity: After one puja, I remember Jim and Hilary coming out and going, "There's no sense of I-ness." You know, you've gone above the ego and the superego. Sometimes you're so clear, you're not aware of it; you're just there in the present moment. I was traveling in a car with people, and I remember feeling very energized. We stopped at this garage, and I felt I could talk to anyone about Sahaja Yoga. I felt so dynamic, so thoughtless. And I thought that was the incredible power of the divine through Shri Mataji's being, the Adi Shakti, that she could take you from here, and she could take all of us and just bring you up here. Clear, clear, clear, and then pow! And it was like you'd get these special experiences at the seminars to go, "Right, this is what this is all about." Because then you'd go back to your London life, and gradually, you start absorbing everything around you and you kind of go down a bit. And then you go, "But Mother showed us what we're aiming for, what we can experience and achieve."

Gail: But in the 80s, we didn't know how to do puja, did we, really? Mother taught us so many things herself. I was just thinking about the lovely music we now get at pujas, but I remember we didn't do any bhajans at the beginning. I remember Mother teaching us how to sing "Aum, Bhagawati." I remember Mother sitting with us and getting us to sing that song. All of this, these wonderful musicians we have now, and so many songs. We didn't have a songbook. I've still got handwritten songs that we'd written out on a bit of paper so we could sing them. We didn't have a mantra book. We used to write out the names on a bit of paper. Everything was handwritten. We didn't know how to praise Mother properly and what the protocols were. Mother often had to tell us the protocols and how to do things.

Host: Any outstanding protocols that you can sort of remember and share with us?

Gail: Well, you didn't touch Mother without her permission. I once touched Mother's shawl, and she said, "Oh no, you mustn't do that. You must be very careful what you touch." The deities would get very upset. But it was just about how we offered the offerings. I mean, we just didn't know really any of those things.

Graham: Even Mother would be actually directing the puja. She would say, "Say this," and she would say, "Pour the water now. Okay, someone come along and decorate the feet." It was all instruction given.

[Viewing photo]

Gail: That photograph illustrates the first puja in the UK. Yes. Mother's got the flowers coming out from her feet. The first Guru Puja. And there were no silver, no nothing. It was in Gavin's flat on the first floor, North Gower Street. Wow, Mother holding the flowers with her feet. No garland. No kumkum.

Felicity: To bring that devotional side out, wasn't it? That was the wonderful thing, to realize how to have that devotion, that bhakti to Mother. We, of course, loved Mother, but we didn't know how to express it.

Graham: I remember her saying, "You know, Graham," she said, "it's very interesting. In India, people will lie down on the ground before I even get there, so that I have to walk over them." It's quite surprising. This was a way of saying, "But hey, watch out, I am not an ordinary person." But she would say, she said that the English were very hard nuts to crack, but once you've got them, they were there, they stuck on. And that's exactly what it was. All these yogis who just went, "Ah, this is it."

Host: I wanted to just conclude a little bit about the ashrams in Earl's Court at that time so that you've got a sense of the timeline.

Felicity: By the time we got to Christmas, Mother had moved into Brompton Square, and somehow we'd come to the end of that contract with Warwick Road and Bramham Gardens. So after Christmas, they closed down. But a new one opened up, Nightingale Lane, in Clapham somewhere. And everybody from the other ashrams combined and moved into this old nursing home, with even more rooms and bigger than Bramham Gardens, and a big garden as well. We came back from India three months later, and they had already moved into Nightingale Lane. And then, of course, my husband and I went to Canada. So it was a very interesting period in time where we had these three ashrams and Brompton Square all within such a close distance.

Graham: It's a great thing to do. Yes.

Host: It's just so wonderful to hear. And also that Shri Mataji actually personally told you all how to do what to do, when to do. We had an insight of ashram living in 2003. We lived in Hounslow Wood Ashram for a while. And it was completely different to anything I had experienced before being in India. It was just so much joy and yet so much challenge at the same time, trying to carry everyone together.

Gail: The bonds that we have, it is so much like a family. You know, even now when we sort of meet the yogis who were there at that time, it is family. The friendships you make there, it's wonderful.

In my fast track, you know, from getting realization, getting married, the first child, William, was born in May of 1982. There were very few children then. There was Olympia and Datta and Maureen's daughter, Athena. It was quite interesting being an early mum because Sahaja Yoga became a very different world with a child. There was this great desire in you to do everything right because you felt you'd been sent this wonderful child to look after.

We were very, very fortunate. I think that Shri Mataji came and blessed the baby quite early on. We were at Chelsham Road, I think, and then we had to move because there was chickenpox in the house. Mother said, "You can't stay there." And we stayed in Patricia's flat, and Mother came to the flat to bless the baby. It was a lovely afternoon with her, with little William sitting on her lap. She brought her granddaughters. And I remember her saying, "Look at his eyes, they're so blue. It's just like heaven." But she did bring some kumkum to put on his forehead because he was born with a little birthmark. She said the flat was owned by Jews, and she said, "Oh, he's a very naughty boy, he's taken on this Jewish problem." She came with this little pot of kumkum, and she was putting it on his head. She gave me the little pot and said, "Keep putting this kumkum on his forehead." And it went very quickly, the little mark went very, very quickly. Seriously, wow. So that was lovely.

But I mean, Mother would say, "Oh, do this for wind, boil some ajwain. Don't give them honey in the beginning. Make sure they have water." She would tell us everything, because I didn't know how to look after a baby.

Felicity: And how to massage them with the oils. I went to Canada and had my baby there. I had this little, not even a booklet, it was like four typed sheets which had instructions from Mother on how to look after a baby, and in the pregnancy as well. I think I worked with Maureen, and we wrote down all the things that had been told. I remember when we gave them cow's milk, it had to be boiled in a cast iron pan because when you boil it in the cast iron pot, it changes the molecules of the milk and it makes it more digestible, and they get less wind. Such a simple thing, but people don't know about that.

Mother was in Australia a lot, and she imparted a lot of advice there too. She talked about not having plastic toys, about having wooden toys, having cotton clothes. Because at that time, in the culture, I would go into the clothes shops and you'd find one cotton dress. Everything else was polyester. And Mother said, "No, they must be in natural fibers that breathe." So I would have to go to each department store to buy one dress so she had more than one. And Mother said to us, "Just keep buying them, and they will come in, and you will change the consciousness, and they will start supplying more." And that's what happened. A few years later, you would go and you would see that there was a lot more cotton.

Host: I must thank you, Felicity, for arranging this session. Gail and Graham, for so happily joining us and sharing your story. I'm so sorry, I have to conclude this session because of a phone call. Thank you so much for joining us, and we hope to reconnect again at some point. Love from all of us. Thank you so much. Bye.

All: Bye. It was really lovely.
