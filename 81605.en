Thank you for joining Shankarji and I for this evening's Zoom meeting on the 78th Indian Independence Day. Shall we start this meeting with your recollection? If we could ask you where you were when you got your Self-Realization and what the scenario was like?

Alright, that's a kind of tricky question. Not straightforward, unfortunately. I used to work for a friend of mine who had a shop in London. I lived in Somerset, and he had a French lady working there called Chantal. I knew her quite well. One day, I came back up to London to help out in the shop, and she had changed completely. She used to be a bit... like they say in French, les misérables. Suddenly she was all joyful and happy, and everything was great.

She told me about Sahaja Yoga and said, "There's this lady, she's an incarnation of the Holy Spirit." I went, "Okay." But she didn't tell me very much about it. She never sat me down and worked on me or anything like that. When I went back to Somerset, I just started meditating spontaneously. Sometimes I would just suddenly feel absolutely silent inside, perfectly peaceful and tranquil. I didn't actually realize at the time it was due to Sahaja Yoga, but it went on for a few months.

Eventually—because I lived near Glastonbury, which is where all the seekers in the world go—a little voice said, "You need to go and find the people who feel the way you do." So I set off on a pilgrimage, packed a rucksack and a guitar, left everything behind, and headed off to London. I went back to the shop to see my friend Randolph, and there was Chantal. She started telling me again about Sahaja Yoga, and I was thinking, "Yeah, this is exactly what I've been experiencing." Collective consciousness. You can feel how other people feel inside by putting your attention on them, and you can change the way they feel by working on them. So I realized that here were the people who felt the way I felt. I just stayed in London and joined Sahaja Yoga. Still there.

Remind us of the time of the year and when it was.

When she told me about it, it was around the middle of the summer of 1982. She actually said, "You should come to this seminar we're having in Gloucestershire." This was Cowley Manor. I said, "Well, I don't know anything about this thing. I think I'd be a bit out of place." It was probably a good thing because Cowley Manor was an incredibly powerful event. Shri Mataji really laid it on the line for the first time that Sahaja Yoga wasn't just about meditating; it was about devotion to her, specifically. So I can place it at about a month before Cowley Manor, which I think was in August.

So what was your first meeting with Shri Mataji like? Was that the first time you saw her?

No, I didn't attend the seminar. The first time I saw her, she had been to India for the winter. She used to come back around Sahasrara Day or maybe Easter. So the first time I actually saw her in person was at a public meeting in Hackney Town Hall or something like that. They had set the stage up with a very nice little throne and lots of flowers. Shri Mataji came in and completely bypassed all the arrangements by walking in below the stage, not on it. She stood with the stage behind her and did the program, just wearing a plain, simple white sari as she always did. That was quite impressive—the fact that she cut through all the pomp and circumstance.

New people were asked to come to the front. I thought, "Well, I'm kind of new because I've never seen her before," so I went up to the front and got worked on. I think Victor Bertini was working on me. Shri Mataji pointed out to people what their problems were. So to Victor, she was saying, "Vishuddhi."

What was the timeframe of that session? Was it 1983?

Yeah, it was around May of 1983. April or May 1983. At the end of the program, I brought a flower because we all brought flowers. My usual stance is always to stand at the back of everything, partly because I'm a few inches taller than everybody else and I'm always embarrassed if I'm at the front. So I'm standing at the back, and there's a big crush around Shri Mataji. I thought, "Well, there's no way I'm going to get to see her with my flower." I'm just standing there, and Shri Mataji said, "What about that gentleman? Did he feel anything?" And she pointed at me. It's like the crowd parted and there was this corridor, and Shri Mataji was sitting there, and it was me with my flower.

So I walked up, gave her the flower, and she said, "Did you feel anything?" Which was a bit tricky because I used to feel a lot, but at that meeting, in her presence, I actually didn't feel anything. That's because of my Vishuddhi, perhaps; the vibrations were blocking it. So I sort of said, "Well, yes, I thought so, something." She went, "Okay." So that was the first time.

I moved into my first ashram after about three months, which was in Queen's Park. There were a lot of young men there; they were all about 18, including Victor, Ian Crawford, Daryl, and Paul Duncan. They were all musicians. After dinner, they'd all eat and then get up, go next door, and start playing music. So I did a lot of washing up because I was the old guy. I was 30 years old, and they were all about 18 or 20. I mean, you've lived in ashrams with young men. You know that they're not very well-trained in the domestic arts.
