She was a mother to us. People find that difficultâ€”she's divine, but she's a mother. But it didn't seem difficult to me. It's like she's your mother. Whether she cooked for you, you just accepted it. It's what a mother would give you. Or she married you. I remember getting married, and at one point I gave Shri Mataji a hug. I think all the Australians in the hall were sort of... You love Shri Mataji, and she's your mother. Of course, at the same time, you had tremendous respect for her, but it didn't seem difficult to put those two things together and to accept it.

I think one of the things about her humour and light-heartedness is the spiritual context of the tradition of the Indian guru who burns people up by looking at them if they trespass on his attention. This idea of spirituality was really permeating seeking when I came along, anyway. It was really nice to have the Adi Shakti showing by her own behaviour that that is not the truth. That is a right-sided, super-conscious aberration, and that the spirit obviously enjoys.

I do remember one little thing. Actually, it wasn't said to me; it was said to my wife, Ruth, when she was staying in Bristol. Ruth was in the bedroom with her, and Mother was putting her makeup on, adjusting everything, asking, "Do I look all right?" and so on. And she turned to Ruth and she said, "Who would be a woman?" Every time I think of that, it makes me laugh, because this is the Adi Shakti, the creator, saying this, and it just hits the nail on the head.

Oh, the interesting thing is, some of you talk about her actually visiting your home, your house, which is a completely alien concept. I mean, what is that like, to have the Adi Shakti turn up on your doorstep? Patricia?

She stayed at our flat, Darwin Court, in Visions Park, for some time. We were rather nervous about it, and I remember hoovering, and hoovering, and hoovering, and hoovering. Suddenly Shri Mataji had arrived, I didn't realise, and she looked at me and said, "You have done this so many times already."

She had just come out of the hospital for a few days, and we were told very clearly by the then-leader, "She must rest. She's not to see anybody. You must just look after her, let her sleep and rest." We were quite prepared for this. But when she arrived from the hospital, there were about fifteen yogis arriving as well, and she behaved exactly as normal. She was seeing people all day, working on them. We had catered for perhaps a small number of people, and we stretched the meals to five times the quantity. I don't know how we did it, but somehow it worked out all right. I think she must have had some of her miracles happening there. It was awesome.
