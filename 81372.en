When I cut my hair, it was 1981. My father was very close to his sister, and she called him and said that he should disown me. I have no idea what overcame my dad, because he normally would listen to his sister with absolute, no alternative. But for that time, for whatever reason, he did not listen to her. And this Hua, I did not see her for many, many years. She was like the elder in the family because my dad's parents had died, and so she was like the mother-in-law for my mother.

I remember when we used to go to her house, she used to hand over the keys of the house to my mother. My mother was supposedly on vacation, but my mother used to be running her sister-in-law's house. And she used to do it. I saw my mother do it. So we grew up with those values and we saw that my mother did it very nicely, never complained and all that. But on the flip side, I would say that this Hua was very fond of my mother and really gave her a lot of love and affection also.

Anyway, when this happened, my father didn't listen to her. He wanted to know about it later. And I was like, okay, obviously, for Sikhs, it's a big deal. You've taken off the turban, the world has come to an end. I understand that part. I understand the sentiment behind it.

But what happened is that, fast forward to 2008, my mother passed away. My father had already passed away. My mother passed away. My aunt was 90 years old, and she lived in Nagpur in the cantonment called Kamti. She sent a message to my sister and said, "Look, I'm too old to come, but I'd really love to see you. So if you both can come, I'd be very happy to have you here."

So we went to see her. Because, you know, I had an elder calling. Irrespective of whatever has happened or not happened, you know how Indian traditions are. We will go. Nobody's going to throw a fit and be like, "Ha! You did that to me," kind of thing. So we went.

When I went to see her—and she's at that time, 89 or 90 years old, a very religious lady all her life—she woke up at four o'clock in the morning, did her prayers, did her kirtan. Throughout the day, she was praying. At night, she'd pray and then she'd go off to sleep. She said to me, and this was a very interesting story: she had only one daughter, and her grandson used to live with her. At some point, the grandson went and got a haircut. When he came home, he told his nani, "You'll be very upset with me, so I don't want you to be upset. I'm going to leave the house and go."

I don't know what happened to her at that time. It put her on pause and made her reflect. And when she reflected, she was like, "These are good boys. They don't smoke, drink. They don't do any of this nonsense. They don't run after women. They chose to do this. Sure, it's against my conditioning, against my sentiments. But what wrong have they really done? They've never been rude, never tried to be unpleasant to people or anything of the kind." And she said these words to me, "God slapped me on my face. Because I said to your father that you should disown him, and now this happened directly to me from my grandson."

So after so many years—I did it in 1981, this is 2008, so you can see, 27 years later—at the age of 89 or 90, she apologized to me. And I was like, "Guruji, please don't do that. What is past is past. It has no significance." That she could introspect, absolutely, so many years later. Sometimes in our conditionings, we just get swayed, and we think that that is the beginning and end of life.

I mean, I would point out to many Sikhs that if you looked at the Granth Sahib, Guru Nanak Sahib took all the saints of that time—Namdev Ji, Baba Farid, Kabir Das Ji, Dhanabhagat, and so many others. Ravi Das, Guru Ravi Das, all of them. Which one of them were the so-called Sikhs? Yes, it used to be a thing of honor to wear a turban, but not the way it's done currently. And so, if their verses are included in the Granth Sahib, and Guru Nanak thought them worthy of it, then what is this thing that you're stuck in? This is just a conditioning. Now, I'm not saying that everybody should now go to the barber shop and cut off their hair. But what I'm saying is the main thing is to live by those principles. We say "part and Sikh." The word Sikh itself means "the one who learns." But how do you learn if you don't take the Granth Sahib? The priest comes and he rattles it off and nobody knows what he's saying, but he's supposed to finish that in a defined period. That's so stupid. What has to happen is that you listen to even one verse, but you imbibe it. It should become part of your DNA.

Same thing with Shri Mataji's talks. You listen to her talk; she says so much in each talk. You probably have to listen to the same talk a hundred times and you'll pick up something. So each talk is a counseling session. In the same way, each verse in the Granth Sahib is a counseling session on what we have to be. That is what you need to go to, not the outward side of it. Because even in Sahaja Yoga, you can wear a badge, and then next month, you're mouthing bad language or you're doing something stupid.

It's the same way in any one of these things. You look at Muslims. The fact remains that Makkah is Makeshwar Shiv. It is. I remember the first time when Shri Mataji said "Makeshwar Shiv," oh my God, the vibrations went just like crazy. And then I remember hearing these Nizami brothers and they said "Makeshwar Shiv." I'm telling you, the whole thing went like that. It was proof that that is the place of Lord Shiva. Now, somebody might say, "I don't believe it." Who cares what you believe or not? That's the reality of it.

And the injustice and, I would say, the bad language which has been done to Hazrat Muhammad, who took his birth under such difficult circumstances in a community which had no concept, no idea of the divine. He came to elevate them, and he hadn't even closed his eyes, and this fellow Abu Bakr was waiting to take over and then do his own shenanigans. So the conversion started with Abu Bakr and that Muwayyah, who was a pedophile, changed the hadiths to put in things attributing them to Hazrat Muhammad Sahib when he had those dirty ideas and filthy things. But nobody wants to correct that. And then the whole world says, "Oh, these Muslims." Well, these are the Muslims who follow Muwayyah and Abu Bakr, but not Hazrat Muhammad Sahib. They insulted Hazrat Fatima.

I remember Shri Mataji told us that because of Shri Fatima, the Muslim karigars have those intricacies that they can do in terms of embroidery and all that other work. It is her blessing that helps them to do it. Why are so many Muslims such good musicians? It's again the blessings of Shri Hazrat Ali and Hazrat Fatima. She's Mahalakshmi, for heaven's sake. And she did everything in parda, but she was so powerful. She never stepped out, yet she did everything. So, what are you talking about? Don't attribute the liberties that have been taken with Islam by these people, by the changes that they made, and say that's what Islam is. It's not.

And the same way with Christianity. Every religion. They just put Mother Mary to the side. And even Lord Christ, they put him aside and said, "I'm the savior of Christianity." Such audacity. Absolutely. I mean, you look at Hindus. We are Sanatanis. In the real sense, we are Sanatanis, which means that we are eternal. But the difference is, in Sahaja Yoga, Shri Mataji has enlightened us. So, we've now become enlightened Sanatanis. That's who we are. But look at what the priests did. This caste system, and somebody is born in a so-called lower caste, and so, "I have a right to torture you." Who gave you that right? These are human nonsense.

The one thing which I would say is with Sahaja Yogis. So many times, Shri Mataji said, "I hope you won't do to me what you've done to the other incarnations." And then she said, "Outside, nobody can touch or hurt Sahaja Yogis. Inside, you can." So please, when you come to Sahaja Yoga, whatever grossness you came from—you came from being a Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Jain, whatever it might be—leave it outside. Park it outside. When an egg becomes a bird, it doesn't stick to the shell. You're a bird. So, when you are embracing the spirit, then embrace the spirit. Because the culture of Sahaja Yoga is that of the spirit. Embrace that and become that.

Embrace what Shri Mataji has taught. Which incarnation taught things in so much detail of how to do puja, how to put this together, how to do that, how not to do that? How should you dress up, how should you talk? She gave a whole thing on all that. We don't have to reinvent it. It's all given for us. She taught us how to do the pujas. So, how is it that in India, they do some different version of it as to what is done in the West? We have so many pujas of hers. You're seeing how the puja is happening. What is so difficult about staying with it?

In the beginning days, even in London, when the priest was called, they would do the shank and they would do the ganti and all that. Shri Mataji discontinued it. Now, people in India are restarting it. Why? What is so difficult for you? The symbols of Sahaja Yoga are in terms of Shri Ganesh and Lord Christ. On the right hand, Shri Mataji always had the cross. Left hand and the feet, it was always the swastik. She never drew the Omkara; we wrote it for our mantras. So, what is difficult? Just stay with it. Without Lord Christ, which one of us would have gotten realization? Not one. He opened the Agnya Chakra. He is Sakshat Shri Ganesha, but he is also Lord Christ. What is your problem? Don't try to change the basics of Sahaja Yoga. She has explained it. Nobody has the right or any business to do it.

Do you have a right to control Nirmal Dham? No. That's the place of Shri Adi Shakti. I would say even if you see the written words of Shri Mataji in many of her letters and other places, she would write herself as "Shri Mataji." S-H-R-I. Now people want to connect it, and it's become S-H-R-E-E. Why? Because there is a big E. Who are you to correct her? Who are you? I question that. But they are so shameless. They see no shame in that. They think, "No, no, no. There must be a mistake." There is no mistake when Shri Mataji has done it. Who are you? Just accept it the way she has explained it.

She explained purity, innocence, chastity. Those are our basics. The chastity starts with our relationship with her. She is the chastity within us as Mother Kundalini. Our relationship with her is that, and then it's the relationship between brothers and sisters. This husband-wife stuff comes much later. So what is the problem with that? Then somebody wants to bring in Karva Chauth. Karva Chauth is initiated in Sahaja Yoga. And Shri Mataji... well, she stopped all these things. So why are you bringing them back in? That's how you create confusion.

If you don't believe it, then maybe Sahaja Yoga is not for you. Shri Mataji has said many times that if there are ten people who get together, who have a lot of love for each other and they get deep inside, they are better than thousands of people. Sahaja Yoga is not a game of numbers, and it's not a show. Not at all.

I'll tell you that in the beginning, we used to go to small houses because at that time, we didn't have money in Sahaja Yoga. In Delhi, we used to go to Uncle Subramaniam's house for Thursday meetings. On Tuesday, we used to go to Nikku's house, and on Saturday, we used to go to Uncle Wing Commander Verma's house. They weren't big houses, but they were very welcoming, and Shri Mataji was the boss there. At that time, we didn't even have talks. There was no video or audio. If there was audio one day, then it was "wow, wow, wow." What happened? Neither did anyone know how to sing nor how to play, but everyone used to meditate. After that, they used to work on each other. The time that Chaitanya used to flow... you don't even remember it in the puja.
