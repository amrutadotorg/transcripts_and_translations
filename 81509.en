I desperately wanted these sweet peas to flower so that I could pick them and give them to Mother. They hadn't flowered, and they hadn't flowered, and they hadn't flowered. Then I got up that morning, and lo and behold, the garden was full of sweet peas.

So I picked them all, and I came to the Bhoomi Devi Puja. We were all standing there in lines, and everyone had their very smart bouquets and flowers and stuff, and I'm standing there with a little bunch of sweet peas. Mother walks along graciously, and she stops, takes my sweet peas, and smells them. She says, "Ah, a Sahaja Yogi's garden," and moves on. So sweet.

She knew all about it?

Yes.

Since then, every bunch of sweet peas, the first one goes to Mother. Yes.

Thanks, Mary.
