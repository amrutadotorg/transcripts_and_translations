Interviewer: Three days before I got my realization. Brilliant. Tell us about your journey. It's a very interesting, continent-hopping, country-to-country seeking. It's really nice. So would you please share with us where you were when you got your realization and what was the build-up to it?

Speaker: I was in Sheffield. I lived in Sheffield; I'd lived there since I was 10, and I was 19 at the time. I was kind of doing teenager things—drugs. Not a lot of drugs, but just bits of psilocybin mushrooms and mostly just cannabis, but I wasn't really into it like my friends were. I didn't like all that, so that helped me as well.

I don't know when I started, but I was reading about self-realization and doing Hatha yoga. I remember reading about this woman—I don't know who it was now—but she was talking about her experience in this Buddhist what-not, and she felt like she'd got her self-realization because she was talking about the detachment and how she didn't feel attached to things anymore. So that was kind of what I thought I'd like to achieve. But it was just one of the things I was into.

I was just feeling this feeling of wanting something new, wanting to meet new people. I was also looking at the church near us called the Church of the Mother of God, and looking at that church and thinking, "Oh, I wonder if I should look into that," because I've never looked into religion. That was quite soon before I got my realization. And I was practicing Hatha yoga quite a lot.

Interviewer: So you knew about the chakras and things that Shri Mataji was talking about in the program?

Speaker: So, I didn't know about the chakras. I did know that Hatha yoga isn't Yoga; I knew that it was the way to Yoga, what Yoga meant. I had The Complete Book of Yoga. I remember when I went to Sahaja Yoga for the first meeting, I came home and looked it up in the book, and Sahaja Yoga wasn't in The Complete Book of Yoga. So that was interesting.

My friend actually told me about the advert because she knew I was into yoga. She just said, "Sahaja Yoga, free, everyone welcome," in a shop window. So that's what I went from.

Interviewer: So this was 16th August 1984?

Speaker: Yes, and in Sheffield.

Interviewer: Wow. So this was a program where Shri Mataji wasn't there herself, was it?

Speaker: She had been in either June or July that year, and I hadn't seen any of the posters, though apparently there'd been posters everywhere.

Interviewer: Okay, tell us about what it was like when you went to that meeting. You got no clue what it was going to be?

Speaker: No idea.

Interviewer: So what happened then?

Speaker: I remember that I didn't notice Mother's photo at that meeting. What I do remember was listening to a recorded talk of hers. Most of all, I remember Gareth's talk, the chart, and the thing that was most fascinating to me was that all the religions were inside us. That it was all part of us. This, to me, was just like, "Oh, wow." It's all inside us.

I don't know if I felt the cool breeze, but I did enjoy it when somebody was working on me. I did notice a difference when somebody was working on me.

Interviewer: So how many people do you think were there? Because this is 1984. There were more yogis in England than before at that time.

Speaker: Yes. At that first meeting, there were maybe eight or nine people. I know Mr. and Mrs. Harris were there, Joan was there, and Joan's sister was there, who left Sahaja Yoga later. Gareth was there, and I think Richard might have been there, who was this yogi who'd been sent to Sheffield to kind of help the collective. That was a bit of a maya, the whole thing. I don't know if he was there at my first meeting, but he was certainly there towards the beginning. Then there might have been a couple of others that were just coming along at that time, but they didn't stick.

Interviewer: So what happened after this first meeting, where you were completely blown away by this integration of all religions and that everything was within? That is so profound.

Speaker: I went home and I told my friend Diane about it, who was quite a close friend, and she was so interested. She came the next week, and we did come together then. Diane stayed in Sahaja Yoga till 1994. She's not a Sahaja Yogi now, but she was quite a dedicated yogi for a long time. It was very helpful for us to come together because there were times when I would have doubts, and she would remind me of the good things. I remember we had this phase where we would vibrate red grape juice and drink it, and we just had a really good time together. She would remind me about that kind of stuff, and that would help consolidate us coming together.

Interviewer: And you kept going to the weekly meetings in Sheffield?

Speaker: Yes. I did not miss them. In fact, we went to two meetings a week at that time. I don't know how long it was before I started to go to two meetings, but we had a "going deeper" meeting at Mr. and Mrs. Harris's, which is where Shri Mataji stayed. So I think she'd probably already stayed there when we were going to those meetings.

Interviewer: Yes, detailed in her interview. You can't imagine how Shri Mataji could fit in that tiny house. That's Mahamaya.

Speaker: Yeah.

Interviewer: So when did you first see Shri Mataji or meet her?

Speaker: That must have been November. I think it was Christmas Puja because I think she had a Christmas Puja here before she went to India. That was the puja where she talks about going beyond cause and effect. We expected that we were supposed to be in thoughtless awareness throughout the puja, and we had a lot of left Vishuddhi about not being good enough for that. I remember at the end, we were just tortured by the fact that we were feeling so guilty about not being perfect. We stayed at Chelsham Road that weekend.

Interviewer: So how was it vibrationally? Could you describe to us, like, when you were meditating up in Sheffield versus when you met her? Well, there was a public program first. Could you describe that?

Speaker: I remember Joan saying to me that when you see her, she'll look like a little old lady. She'll look like your grandmother. I think she was kind of preparing me. It’s a good thing she said that, because Shri Mataji didn't look like that to me. When I saw her, I think I must have already known who she was, as I was going to a puja, wasn't I?

In those days—and it probably happens all the way through—when Shri Mataji was here, almost every time you saw her there was this burst of your heart opening. In the beginning, I just thought, "Oh, she's opening her heart," but I think what was happening was that the vibrations were so powerful, it was just pushing everything up and bursting. Then lots of tears often would come. That did happen the first time I saw her as she walked onto the stage in this hall. I was just really, really moved and recognizing how special it was to actually see her.

Interviewer: This was probably the Hounslow puja, as you've mentioned.

Speaker: The first time I saw her was the public program the night before, but yes, it was in Hounslow.

Interviewer: And then you stayed at Chelsham Road, which was perhaps your first experience of living in an ashram for a little while.

Speaker: Just there for two nights. It was our first experience of another collective and our first experience of these people who you felt were really high-up because they'd been in Sahaja Yoga forever. But it was basically not even 10 years, was it? Just nine years. But they also behaved like this was something that made them really special. When you walked into it, you were walking into this incredible thing. You felt how historic it was when you were with the yogis in London. That was a different experience. And there were lots of little difficulties as well, with things people were saying that would make us feel terrible.

Interviewer: I'm just wondering what this 19-year-old teenager—well, on the brink of getting over being a teenager—what did that 19-year-old make of it all?

Speaker: It was just really exciting. Definitely really exciting. And sometimes often feeling not good enough and doubting whether I was good enough, but also a sense of responsibility. I remember having that sense of what she was bringing us into and what we were there for, that we were her instruments. I don't know if I understood that with words, but I remember understanding it. This was a movement that we were now into, moving forward.

Interviewer: So how would you sort of describe—we talk about spiritual ascent and things. And there you were with your friend Diane, who has chosen to be out of the collective, which is fair enough; everyone has their own free will. But how did you think the spiritual ascent, the vibrations, manifested at that time?

Speaker: You mean, was I thinking about it then?

Interviewer: Yes, because you were only 19.

Speaker: When you're 19, you do think you know a lot more than you are. I remember the first moment that I knew. I was just tidying my bedroom before I went down to London, and I picked up this photograph that I think maybe Joan had given me. It was a photograph with the light coming down on Shri Mataji. I picked it up, looked at the photograph, and there was just this enormous kind of realization in me of just gratitude and depth. "Oh, this is what I've been looking for."

Now, I was only 19, so this must have been lifetimes. I must have got this sense of the lifetimes without necessarily being aware of that. And just sitting down and sitting with it for a while. I don't know how long; I just stopped and sat with that. So, it's just the feeling of that excitement and the enormity of it. It's hard to put into words.

Interviewer: It is difficult, yes. It's not easy, and sometimes there aren't enough words to describe those feelings. We can feel it on the vibrations, mostly. Such a joy and such a privilege Shri Mataji has granted us. So what was it like going on from this puja that you had in London? What happens next?

Speaker: When I sent you the stuff about my journey, I do kind of really remember it in the pujas. That's how I remember those days. I don't remember much in between, but I remember the pujas.

The second puja I went to was Easter Puja, also in Hounslow in 1985. I don't remember much about that, but I do remember Gavin singing. I think it was at that puja that he sang that song, "Mother, you are near, Mother." I know he's gone now and kind of left in a not-great way, but obviously at that moment when he was singing that song, he knew who Shri Mataji is. The chorus is all the nirmala, and it was just so moving and deep. One of those moments where you recognize what those words mean—obviously not in the depth of fully realizing it, but it takes you really deep into that purity. So that was really strong.

After that, there was the seminar in Birmingham, and it was a Mahamaya seminar. I don't think we knew it was going to be about Mahamaya, and then there was a Mahamaya Puja, so it was just all Mahamaya. Lots of, "we're thinking this is going to happen, but this didn't happen." For example, we thought there was going to be the puja on the Saturday morning, and then there wasn't a puja because there wasn't a sari. So the puja was delayed till the next day. The feeling I got from it wasn't just that we were all being tested on our sense of knowing what's what, but I do think Mother was playing with the leaders there as well. She was playing with the people who kind of thought that they knew what was what, and then they suddenly didn't.

When the actual puja happened, we were late for it because we had to get all our stuff ready as we'd checked out of the hotel. We obviously didn't recognize that we needed to do that a lot quicker. We felt a little bit like, "Oh gosh, it's not good that we're keeping Mother waiting." That's definitely not good.

Interviewer: But at this Birmingham seminar, did Maureen talk to the ladies?

Speaker: I hoped you weren't going to ask me that. I know what it was about. It was about trying to get across to us about being dignified and having respect for ourselves, and about what kind of clothes we wear and things like that. But what she said to get that across, I don't know.

Interviewer: It's just that Shri Mataji, I think, had asked her to do it.

Speaker: I think so. You'd have to ask her, but I think so. For me, I was like, "I don't know if I can do this." Not that I didn't believe it, but I didn't know if I could manage it. It all sounded a bit... I was a bit overawed by it.

Interviewer: To be dignified? You were a bit of a feminist then, weren't you?

Speaker: Yes, but I think I was kind of willing and feeling able to drop anything that I needed to drop. I do remember that. But I didn't know whether I could become this person. It all sounded so unreachable. Not that Maureen herself looked like some kind of unreachable person; she was just a normal person, so I don't know why I was thinking that.

Interviewer: I think it's a thing that comes with experience, isn't it? Because you were a young woman then. So what was your next puja?

Speaker: After that, it was Saraswati Puja, 1985. Goodness me, that was one amazing puja. That was my first puja abroad. Wow. When I look back, I just think, "How on earth did I do this?" I wasn't even working; I was on benefits. I don't know how I did it.

Interviewer: How did you do it?

Speaker: It's the same now: Mother looks after it. She just does it somehow. I don't know how I managed to go to Saraswati Puja in Vienna. It was in a small town just outside Vienna called Laxenburg, which is where Maria Theresia had one of her complexes. I didn't know this then, but I later found out she was an incarnation of Rajalakshmi and a queen of Austria, maybe in the 1700s. So there was this sense that we were there for a reason.

It was all very grand, beautiful buildings. We stayed in the tennis club, and Gregoire stood there and welcomed everybody. He shook everybody's hand and spoke to every yogi who came in.

Interviewer: Oh, that's so nice.

Speaker: Yes. He'd started Sahaja Yoga there. It was phenomenal. Sahaja Yoga was only like three years old in Austria then. Incredible. There was the talk, "You have to be in Nirvikalpa," and that's so powerful. That was on the night before the puja, and of course, I was like, "There's just no way I'm going to be able to go to that puja tomorrow." I thought Nirvikalpa was this impossible thing, because it means you never had any doubts, and I knew that I had doubts sometimes. I think it also means you don't have doubts in yourself, which is a much bigger thing.

Anyway, we did all go to the puja; nobody didn't go. It was all part of Mother taking us to that next level. I do remember Gregoire giving us a talk in the tennis courts. We had this curtain between the men and the women, and I remember him talking about that plate. I think Mother might have talked about it as well, like, "You're all on this plate, and if you haven't got a really strong hold of yourself, you might fall off the plate as it's being lifted." There was a real sense of that that weekend, that we were getting moved to the next level. I'm sure that also made me think, "There's just no way I'm going to be able to get to the next level; I'm going to be left behind."

The Havan was after the puja. The actual puja talk is so deep, and it's really different from the Nirvikalpa talk. It's like, "Okay, let me just take you to this place that I've told you you've got to get to." But it was the Havan, which is usually before, but this was after the puja at the tennis courts. I think it was Rustam who was leading it. It was at the end of the whole weekend, and that's when it all cleared. That's when I really cleared, and I just stopped worrying and started enjoying. I remember on the plane back, singing, "I can see clearly now the rain has gone." That's how I felt.

Interviewer: Oh wow, what a lovely experience in Austria. And it’s just so clear how Shri Mataji, being the Adi Shakti and the Mahamaya, how through all these pujas there were such quantum jumps in the spiritual ascent.

Speaker: Yes, and 1985 did feel like that. It was my first full year, really. I came in the middle of '84, but I went to a lot of pujas, and it felt like each one was so mighty.

We had this period where Shri Mataji said that we needed to do a tour of the UK, going to Edinburgh. I think it was like the first tour without Shri Mataji in person. I remember being in Cambridge, and when we were there, we were called back to London. I remember thinking, "Well, what about the tour?" Anyway, we were called back to London, and there was something serious going on in the collective. We were in the Hounslow ashram garden, and I was sitting at the back. I don't think I knew while it was happening that there was an actual puja, that they were washing Mother's feet. But she also gave a really strong talk, and she was talking about specific people. It was a really strong... what we used to call pap-catch in those days. It was really to clear something.

Interviewer: In '85, you reckon? Would that be June of 1985?

Speaker: Um... so I remember that experience of being called by Mother in the middle of something that seemed really important for Sahaj. But of course, it was more important that we do what Mother said.

Interviewer: I was just thinking I'd look up on Amrit and provide the links for the puja talks you're talking about, so we can have a reference and enjoy Shri Mataji's talk with these memories.

Speaker: Other people might remember it because, of course, it was spontaneous. It wasn't planned. It was a powerful experience. It was probably about trying to live with the maryadas and keeping the Mooladhara clean. It was a very big challenge then.

Interviewer: That's all right. So where do you go after this?

Speaker: I remember the next puja was Guru Puja. All this time, I'm living in Sheffield, so I'm traveling to these pujas. Guru Puja was like no other puja I've ever experienced.

Interviewer: Where was this Guru Puja 1985?

Speaker: In France. I think I found out later that it was a place where there'd been false gurus. I think that explained what an extraordinarily confusing and upsetting and strange experience it was the whole weekend.

Interviewer: Could you describe to us what was strange?

Speaker: The first thing I remember was sitting in this talk by Yogi Mahajan. I was really bored, but I was just doing what you do. Everybody else was sitting there listening, so it didn't occur to me to even worry about whether I was bored or not. I remember afterwards thinking, "Oh yeah, that was actually quite a boring talk."

I do remember getting out of that building and this feeling that there was something wrong. And then this real, serious feeling among the yogis that we hadn't gone to welcome Mother at the airport. It was a serious thing that she wasn't happy about. At that point, it didn't occur to me that I should have been doing something different. I was just thinking it hadn't been arranged for us to go and welcome Mother at the airport, so that's bad, that's upsetting. But gradually, as time went on, I realized it was a lot more serious than that. It was an extremely serious situation. We'd come to see Mother and to worship Mother; we hadn't come to do anything other than that. So if she'd arrived and we hadn't been there to welcome her, then what was she coming to us for?

So then I was kind of realizing, and obviously everybody else was realizing what was going on. There was a lot of fog, physically, but also a feeling of fog in the brain and just not knowing what's happening or what's the right thing to do next.

I remember that Dr. Warren also gave a talk, maybe almost directly after Yogi Mahajan's talk, and his first words were, "Do you realize what you've done?" That's when we were recognizing how serious it was. It wasn't just a bit of a mistake we'd made. It was like, what were we doing here if we hadn't thought of going to greet Shri Mataji at the airport? There was only a scattering of people there, maybe eight or so.

Interviewer: And how many yogis had gathered for the puja?

Speaker: There were probably about maybe one hundred, two hundred. It would have been all of Europe, and maybe Americans too.

So I remember that talk from Warren, and then later on finding out that even sitting there listening to Warren's talk was part of the whole maya of what was going on. We just didn't know; we were just kind of lost. At the same time, I did feel like I was taking in the lessons. I was taking in the sense that yes, I did have responsibility. It was becoming clear that the ones who had been asking about going to see Shri Mataji at the airport had done the right thing. I hadn't asked because it hadn't occurred to me. I just thought everything was organized as it was organized.

When the actual puja came, which would have been probably the next day, the talk was very serious. There was this sense that Shri Mataji was kind of holding her body really hard to prevent the deities from doing what they might do, because they had made an agreement to look after her. So she was holding them in order to protect us, but at the same time, she had this experience of us not being there. She was saying that the people who'd asked to go to the airport, and the people who were at the airport, they could come and do puja. And also the people who arrived later, I think. I was one of the people at the back because I hadn't been any of those people.

It was just a big lesson in recognizing that each one of us has our own individual relationship with Shri Mataji, and that "I am my own guru" thing. After I'd come home and after a while, I realized it was a big collective thing and it was also about working out the false gurus.

Interviewer: It seems, listening to it now, that this Guru Puja in 1985 was, as it is even now, a lesson for all of us yogis. Because Shri Mataji has given us our self-realization and also this capacity to be our own guru, and therefore we have the free will...

Speaker: It's the having the vibrational sense of what's happening, you know, having this sense of, "What the heck, this doesn't feel right." There were lots of people feeling like that that weekend, but I wasn't particularly noticing myself until obviously we found out that there was definitely something wrong. I'm just very grateful that I was there at that puja. I learned so much.

Interviewer: There were yogis who weren't allowed at the puja that time then?

Speaker: Well, we were sitting at the back. We were still in the room, in the tent. So it was kind of a symbolic thing that we weren't at the puja, but we were sitting there at the back. It was Mother's grace.

Interviewer: We were listening to this talk some time ago, and it was so strong. Mother was really reminding us of the very basics. We're so used to now seeing the very gentle, loving aspect of Shri Mataji that to hear that, one is just like, "Wow."

Speaker: Yes. And I must say, it's interesting because it's really in the past 20 years that I have felt how unconditional the love is in the collective. When Shri Mataji was correcting us so much—and I'm talking about the yogis now—what was then happening was that the yogis were having reactions, almost as if they were supposed to correct people, and they were judging people. So we had to kind of catch up with ourselves on that. We had to get to that point of recognizing, "No, it's not up to us to judge." But Mother got us to that. She got the collective to that point.

Interviewer: Yes, and she did say that she would not leave until she's established the collective. And actually, very nice lessons to learn early on.

Speaker: Yes. And also, the next puja in England was the Ganesha Puja and the joy—you see that contrast as well. The joy of greeting Shri Mataji at Brighton train station. You've seen some photos, and they're really beautiful.

Interviewer: We'll put the link for the puja so everyone can enjoy them.

Speaker: And the link, because there is an actual video of that, of her arriving in Brighton. It is a very historic moment. I didn't connect it to Guru Puja at the time, but Joan mentioned it recently, the connection between them. That was my next puja, and I remember I had some money set aside to give to the collective in Sheffield. That was the money that I used to go to Brighton, because Joan said, "No, use it to go to the puja. That's going to contribute to the collective, you going to the puja." So that's how I got there.

Interviewer: And what was the puja like, with so much joy?

Speaker: We had this meditation almost straight after the welcoming. We went to this hall, we all sat, we sang, and the joy was so immense. I felt such immense joy. Then at the end of the meditation, David was talking about the joy, and I remember thinking, "Oh, right, everybody else is feeling it too." I hadn't quite gotten used to the fact that we all feel the same, that it was a collective feeling. Obviously, that was the blessings pouring down on us from that welcoming.

It was another historic puja talk. The Birmingham talk about the Mooladhara was very specific, and then that Ganesha Puja talk about chastity and faith... everybody knows that Brighton puja talk. It's really long, isn't it? A very, very important talk. If you get that right, then things are easier and the deity is there to help much more.

Each puja, she's bringing us to that level. I suppose I just have this sense of those early pujas really bringing us up. But it could be that it was the same with every puja. It's because we have such limited understanding as human beings. The divine ways are so exponentially divine, and we try and understand from the things that we know. Obviously, we are in a different dimension, and sometimes we don't have the words, but we have that experience. We touch that.

Interviewer: Yes. Thank you so much for sharing so graciously and so generously your times with Shri Mataji and how the collective grew and evolved so we can enjoy it today. So thank you to you, to all who were there, and all who will be hopefully in the future.

Speaker: Thank you very much. And most of all, thank you so much to our Holy Mother who made it all possible.
