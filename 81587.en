I think I was going mad, probably. And very sick. But sometimes I was well; it was on and off. Sometimes very well, sometimes not well at all. Of course, meeting Mother is the greatest day of my life. It's something for which I'm still very thankful to God today—to have had that chance to meet Shri Mataji and also the chance to somehow understand who she is during that meeting. Otherwise, I could have lost everything, because Shri Mataji was going away the next day. So time was short. I think Shri Mataji and God made it easy for me. It had to be such that I had to understand it there and then.

There was a certain preparation before meeting Mother. Once, I was on a motorbike and had a head-on collision with a car. The moment the motorbike hit the car, my body was thrown into the air. While I was in the air, I knew I was going to die. In that split second, I saw my whole life since I was born—things one cannot remember from when you are a baby, up to that day. Then I saw my own funeral. I saw my parents weeping over my body. Each and every person I had met in my whole life was there. An angel up in the air told me it was a waste of a life, a life which really had a purpose. So it was really wrong. The next thing I heard was a big bang. This was the bang of my helmet on top of the bonnet of the car, and then I fell on the floor. Not a scratch. Nothing. It was a very strange feeling. How can someone see his whole life from beginning to end, including his own funeral, in less than a split second? So that was like an awakening experience.

Then one day I was in bed at 4 a.m. when my parents arrived home. They woke me up and showed me a glance of a picture of Shri Mataji. They said, "Look, look at what we have found!" I just said, "Wow," and went back to sleep. In those days, because I was very ill, I was always praying to Christ to send the dove, the Dove of the Holy Ghost, to land on top of my head. That's something I was always praying for because I knew I needed divine salvation. There was no other way I could get out of that situation. But even though I prayed and prayed, nothing happened, as you probably know from experience.

But that night, after seeing a glance of Shri Mataji, when I woke up, there was a voice in my head. I just knew it was the voice of Christ, but I wasn't for sure. The words were: "I was hungry and you didn't give me any food. I was naked, and you gave me no clothes. I was ill, and you didn't come to see me. I was in jail, and you didn't come to see me either." Those words kept coming into my mind, very loud. And I knew, "Oh my goodness, these are the words of Christ, of course."

Then I realized, yes, of course, my cousin was in jail, and I had refused to go and see him for two years. He was my age, but he had done some drug offenses, and I said, "No way. I'm not going to visit." And then I realized, my goodness, what a selfish person I am. Not minding the fact I'm hurting my parents, my aunt, my cousin. I just don't care for other people. All I care about is myself. I'm really the most selfish, absurd person. So, luckily, I had this thought: I want to go and see my cousin in jail at last. My parents said, "My God, what happened to you? Did you have an epiphany? We've been telling you this for two years!" I just said, "I don't know. I have to go and see him today."

That was my luck because I went to see my cousin in jail that day for the first time. On the way back, my parents went to see Shri Mataji again, so I was with them. That was my chance at last to see Shri Mataji. However, my girlfriend was an atheist and a communist, and she refused to go. Shri Mataji was staying in a place where you had to go up many stone steps. I don't know what came over me. I said, "Okay, you have to go. That's it." I dragged her up the steps by force, hurting her arm. I dragged her all the way up so she had to come as well.

We arrived there and were sitting in a small room. This place was like an old castle, a very ancient building, and the room where they told us to wait for Mother had no windows. To go into the room, we had to go down some little stone steps. The door was so small, like in ancient buildings, that to go inside you had to bend down a little bit. Once you are in the room, it's like a cell. You cannot get out. We were waiting there for Shri Mataji, who was having a siesta, and all my family was with me in that room. Then I saw some people passing through. I thought, "I know those guys." They were Sahaja Yogis, but I had met them in other false guru movements. I couldn't believe I would come to a place like this and meet these guys. I jumped out of that room and went after them.

As I went after them, I saw a lady coming out of a room, totally disheveled; her sari was not arranged. Mother had just come out of her siesta. From a distance, I had a glance of Mother and had the same experience as with the motorbike. But instead of seeing my present life, I saw all my past lives and could see that Shri Mataji had been my personal Mother throughout all my lives. That's what the vision gave me. So there you are. It was very easy for me to know that she is the Mother of the Universe. I knew I had met Christ at last. That's what I wanted. It was an emergency because Mother was going away the next day.

But then Mother came to the little room where we were standing with my family. She arrived at the room and looked in. I was back there, sitting next to my parents and my girlfriend. The first thing Shri Mataji said, pointing at my girlfriend, was, "Who is that woman? What is she doing here?"

I lost my tongue. And Shri Mataji looked at me. "You can translate." She knew that I knew English; I had been studying English for two years. I was really amazed. My goodness, she even knows that. "Who is that woman? What is she doing here?"

I said, "It's my..." I couldn't find the word. "My girlfriend."

"My what?"

"My girlfriend."

"No, no, I don't know 'girlfriend.' That doesn't exist. It's indecent. It's absurd. It's obscene." Then she asked, "Do you really love her?"

Big silence. I couldn't say I did, because I didn't. You see, Mother knew everything. "If you don't love her, then stop it. This is indecent. It's very gross. It's appalling." That was the introduction.
