We were both in Birmingham at the time. I'd finished college and Frances was at college, but we'd met after that. We were doing this yoga, and a girl invited us to meet Shri Mataji. For me, it was really weird. I'd been seeking, I'd been everywhere, and I used to go up to the library in Birmingham, which has a really good section on Indian and Eastern religions. I remember reading a few lines that said getting self-enlightenment was like being slightly drunk, which Frances actually did say.

I remember Shri Mataji coming to Dr. Johnson House and listening to her talk. The thing that impressed me most was that when Shri Mataji spoke, she never said, "Well, I think it's like this, and I think it's like that." She just said, "This is this, this is this, this is it." I thought, "How can she say that without there being a debate?" Then something in my head said, "She talks like Christ." She just talks like she knows that it is like this and it isn't any other way. I remember thinking how weird it was that she just talked like that.

After she gave her talk, I did feel realized, and I knew what it was. But I didn't know what that meant. I'm a Westerner, so I'm realized, but I'm thinking, "Well, what does that mean?" The funny thing is, I was always on the go, always busy. But at that point, my head was really peaceful. I just thought, "Wow, this is incredible. I feel slightly drunk, but nicely drunk and really happy." Some of the guys that were there said, "Do you want to work on other people with us?" and I just said, "Yeah, why not?" Normally, I would have been thinking they were weird.

Then, as Frances said, somebody asked, "Would you like to touch Shri Mataji's feet or kiss Shri Mataji's feet?" I can't remember which it was now. And I just went over and did that. That was really weird as well. Why would a Westerner go and kiss an Indian lady's feet? It was just so weird, but I didn't think it was weird at all at the time. I just did it.

The next day, we went to Bala's house. Again, I could feel where Mother was. Bala said, "Can you feel where Mother has been sat?" and I could feel a wind coming from the chair. But again, I didn't think anything of it. I remember feeling it but not thinking anything about it.

I don't think there were 20 in the room; I think there were far less because it was a very small room, only about 10 by 10 or 12 by 12. Shri Mataji kept eating channa, didn't she? She was always just throwing channa into her mouth. I don't know if anybody else experienced that. She used to say she was eating the bhoots. But what I was really impressed with, or surprised by, is that Shri Mataji went around the room and was attentive to every single person.

There was a guy sitting in the corner, and she asked him, "What do you do?" He had a guru, and he had a mantra, which was, "Who am I?" Shri Mataji said, "I know this man." I thought, "Well, how does she know him?" You always got this feeling with Shri Mataji—and it was only my second day—I'm thinking, "How does she know that person?" When somebody spoke about a spiritual teacher, she would say, "I know them," or "I don't know them." I was getting the feeling that where she was coming from with "knowing them" wasn't from a book or a newspaper. I felt she was talking about knowing them from inside somewhere. That's the impression I got.

The story with me is that I kept fiddling with a watch while I was there. I'd only bought it a couple of days before, and I kept fiddling with it. She said, "Give me your watch." I gave her my watch, and she put a bandhan on it and said, "Oh, bhoots are like flies. They get everywhere." She gave me the watch back. Of course, I haven't got that watch now because I didn't know who Shri Mataji was at the time. So that watch is gone.

I also remember, for some reason, Shri Mataji said to bring lemons and a small bottle of olive oil, which she vibrated, as we would call it now. At that time, again, I hadn't a clue what she was doing with them. And that's about it for those first two days.
