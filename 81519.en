As a protocol, Ba used to walk behind Mataji. As Mataji was walking, Ba saw all the stars come down from the sky and follow Shri Mataji. They were flying behind her like butterflies, and everyone who was walking behind Mataji saw it.

When they reached the room, Ba was preparing Mataji's bed. Mataji rushed to her and asked, "What are you doing?"

She said, "I'm preparing my bed. I want to go to sleep."

Mataji said, "No, you are not going to sleep. Come here, sit on my bed and take the vibrations."

So Ba did. As she was taking vibrations, all those stars came and completely covered Mataji. Afterwards, Mataji was snoring, and Ba went to sleep.

The next morning, Ba said, "Mataji, I saw this last night. All the stars were following you, and when you slept, they covered you."

Shri Mataji replied, "Yes, this is normal. Only a few people can see. But I don't know why Sir C.P. can't see."

That was hilarious. "I don't know why Sir C.P. can't see." Yeah, it's such a compliment, isn't it? It's brilliant.
