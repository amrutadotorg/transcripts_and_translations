Hi, everybody. We're here in Cincinnati, Ohio, and I will have a couple of other people from Cincinnati that are going to say a few words as well. But I'd like to start this by showing you all a very short video of our dear friend Carolyn so that you can get an idea of who she is. This was taken at her 80th birthday party about four years ago. During that time, everybody was so happy and so jolly, but when she had a moment with the microphone, this is what she said to us. So can someone roll that for us, please?

[Video of Carolyn begins]

My hope is, and I hope everybody will join me in this hope—even though you're not 80, you're going to be. I have Shri Mataji's feet here and my attention on them, and that I, and we all, will remember every time we go into a store or into any public place, to remember the vibrations that we're spreading and not take it for granted and not forget about it.

My hope is also that we'll find some tremendously creative ways to spread Sahaja Yoga in Cincinnati. I haven't completed this. In fact, we've barely started. So that's my hope that everything will get moving. After all, I may only have 20 or 30 more years. So let's go.

[Video ends]

As you can see, that was our beautiful Carolyn and how she was always thinking of Sahaja. I wanted to share with you all a few things about her life. So if you'll bear with me, I am going to read this. I decided that would be the best way. We have two other speakers from Cincinnati, but I'll start with this part.

She came with Shri Mataji to Cincinnati, and she traveled many times in the U.S. with Shri Mataji. She was a constant companion for her. I was still just a few years new to Sahaja at that time and remember being so impressed with this lovely, dignified lady traveling with Mother. As the visit progressed, I found out we also shared a background in actively working for civil rights and for equal rights for women.

I was employed in TV and radio at the time, and it was wonderful to find another yogini who was also interested in politics and civil rights. But what I really learned from Carolyn was how to listen to Mother. Beyond her spiritual teachings, Shri Mataji often shared with us her ideas of what equality and harmony are and how Sahaja Yoga championed true equal rights.

Carolyn incorporated many of those ideas in her book, It Takes a Mother. I feel privileged to have read it and to have done a first pass at preliminary editing. She then shifted it to Richard and Felicity Payment, who polished it and helped get it published. In It Takes a Mother, Carolyn writes a fictional but somewhat autobiographical story of a woman's fight for equality in Washington, D.C.'s early TV, the passing of equal rights broadcasting legislation, and her work among American Indians. It culminates in self-realization. This book, It Takes a Mother, is available on Amazon, and we intended to have her review it here. Alpani and I, and others, had talked about having her review it on this site, but unfortunately, our time with her ran out too quickly.

But I urge you to go to Amazon and get It Takes a Mother. It will show you more than we can say in our few minutes here. Over the years, as I got to know her better, I realized how well-respected Carolyn was and how many yogis, old and young alike, turned to her for advice. When you asked Carolyn about a problem, she was able to help you look at it from a self-realized vantage point.

Whether it was at the Canajoharie school, where she worked tirelessly, or a collective problem, she did not shirk from difficulties. Sometime in early 2009, Carolyn took vibrations and decided to move to Cincinnati. I think that date is right—a lot of us have debated that, but we think it was around 2009. She was an immediate asset to our collective, as she had been to the other U.S. collectives she’d lived with or started herself.

After Shri Mataji passed away in 2011, Carolyn was elected as president of the U.S. Council. During a very difficult and tumultuous time, she held the U.S. yogis together. We were grieving, and many conflicting ideas for the future emerged, but Carolyn's faith in Mother was steadfast. Slowly, as a country, we regained our equilibrium.

Here in Cincinnati, we conducted local public programs, and Carolyn even brought guests across the Ohio River to my Covington, Kentucky programs. Vibrations always increased when she joined us. In her leisure time, Carolyn was a lot of fun to be with. We both loved music and enjoyed many concerts together, from jazz on the outdoor lawn of an African-American orphanage to the symphony at our renowned music hall and several choral performances featuring Sahaja yoginis. Carolyn loved many kinds of music, and attending events with her made the experience even more interesting.

We once drove deep into Appalachia together to give realization at a Corbin, Kentucky high school as part of the Sahaja Yoga Health Corps project. After traveling for more than three hours, Carolyn was immediately on point, engaging high school students in trying meditation. With seemingly effortless remarks, she helped us interest those Appalachian high school kids in meditating. Afterwards, their faces were beaming, and they sent us lovely thank-you notes. When she had the collective meeting at her house, we all loved how beautifully she led the meeting and how lovingly she fed us delicious snacks.

Carolyn was always ready to assist with important projects. She was instrumental in helping us conduct a Love America tour, where teams of visiting European youth helped us blitz many businesses, schools, and mental health centers with the experience of Sahaja Yoga. Afterwards, we continued that work at the Linder Center for Mental Health and at a senior citizen retirement center.

Sometime during the COVID pandemic, when we all separated into our homes and online Zoom meetings, Carolyn's health started becoming troublesome. Our dear yoginis Shalini and Ram, as well as many others, took great care of Carolyn. By early this year, it was obvious that the end was near. In late April, as many of the yogis as possible met and meditated together and then trooped across town to her hotel room. Even then, Carolyn remembered everyone by name, went around the room saying lovely things to each of us before receiving a colorful photo showing our Cincinnati fireworks sparkling over the riverfront. It was signed on the back by all the yogis, and she thanked us profusely. She said she would have it placed with her in her coffin, as it was to be a green burial. As usual, she made an ordinary event take on a dignity and specialness that often happened effortlessly around her.

At the urging of her children and siblings, she spent the last couple of weeks of her life with them at her older sister's house on the East Coast. She graciously shared those final days, watching movies and receiving love from her kids, grandkids, and birth family. We had all said our goodbyes, but most appropriately, when we were just coming up from Sahasrara Puja on Mother's Day, Sunday, May 8th, we received the word of her passing.

I think I speak for all the Cincinnati yogis when I say that we were honored to know Carolyn. She was a special friend to each of us. Her knowledge of Sahaja Yoga was deep and comforting, and we all loved her dearly.

We're also privileged today to have Svetlana Cleet here with us, and she has a few things she'd like to say. And then we have Hilary Thomas, who wants to say a few things.

Hello again. My name is Svetlana Cleet. I got my realization in 1989 in Leningrad, St. Petersburg, when Shri Mataji just started Sahaja Yoga. After the Indian yogis left, I was one of the first who led public programs there. I met Carolyn in '93 in Moscow at my wedding, because my husband and I, and she and her Ukrainian husband, were married on the same day: November 15th, '93. I just noticed how beautiful she was inside and out—always dressed well, always had nice jewelry. As a matter of fact, paying respect to her, I'm wearing her jewelry today because I feel its vibrations, because she was a great yogini.

When I was sick with cancer a few years back—I'm well now—I could not eat or drink through my mouth because of radiation damage and had nourishment only through intravenous. Carolyn gave me a beautiful dress. She said, "I want you to look beautiful." It was so sensitive of her, so sincere—her pure love, like no other.

I'm deprived of collectively enjoying food with yogis, but she wanted me to be part of the collective and looking beautiful. We went to the symphony together. When there was Realize America in Cincinnati, she was a great part of that. She was like super luxury—she bought real plates and real silverware for the collective to enjoy their meals. For foreign yogis who came for that event, they were all together and collectively happy. I still have that set, and when yogis come for pujas or for some events at my house, I offer it to them. I feel that Carolyn is still with us.

To end my small memory, I can tell you, I started reading her book, It Takes a Mother, after she passed. I felt her real presence on every page, and it brought Carolyn back into my life again. Thank you so much.

Wonderful. I think we have Hilary Thomas, who's written something that she wanted to share with us. Hilary?

Great, yes. Hello, everybody. Thank you so much for giving us the chance to remember dear Carolyn.

"Thank you so much for having me." I almost remember that and say that many times in my life since she said that. The last time I saw her was in the hospital before her family took her to Maryland. She was joking and being positive, as always. This was just one week before she passed. When the doctor came to discharge her, he said that it had been a privilege to take care of her. To me, it was also a privilege and a blessing to have known Carolyn. We love and miss you, Carolyn. And to see you, too, all your friends in Europe.

So now, I think if we can, we will move to Teresa Cody. She is at the Canajoharie School and worked so much with our dear Carolyn. So please, do we have Teresa?

Yes, she's here. Yes. Jai Shri Mataji, everyone. Thank you for inviting me. I was doing the same thing yesterday—I was trying to remember when Auntie Carolyn started here. I believe it was in 2008 because it was before she moved to Cincinnati. One thing that I really remember about her is that she was 70 when she started coming here to help, and she had the energy of ten people.

Seeing her work, we'd all look at each other and think, "Oh, we better get up. She's working so hard. We can't say we're tired." I'd say, "Oh, this is hard work," and she'd go, "No, it's not. It's not hard work. It's not hard work at all." Anita's here, who's originally from Cincinnati too, and we were talking about how she was a warrior. That truly was what Auntie Carolyn was. There was no "no."

It could be done. One of the things she helped us with regarding the government was a religious visa we were working on. What they had written in there, she said, "They can't write that. That's racist. We have to fight this." So she got on her hat and we worked with our lawyer. It went down to Homeland Security, and then they kept not doing their job. So she called our local congressperson and worked with them to fight it, to finally get us this religious visa so that we could employ people from afar. But one thing she always did—and we were talking about this last night—was that there was always love. There was never any doubt in her mind that things could get done.

And I think all the children here made her feel young, too. She played with them so much. I remember one time we have a tractor, and they would go on a hayride. The trailer fell off and Uncle Russ couldn't get it reconnected. The grass was above their heads, and she goes, "Come on, we can walk through this!" That's what she really liked seeing, teaching the children not to give up, that you can persevere through anything. We had this big, steep hill that we climb up by a creek, and she'd yell at the aunties, "Oh, no, don't help them! They can do it. Let them try. If they can't, we'll assist, but let them try." So that's my memory of her: never giving up. There's always an answer. There was no stopping.

She worked here at the school for eight or nine years, so she was in her late 70s when she finally said, "I don't think I can do it anymore." And it's like, "Auntie, you've done so much." But every day I would talk to her, she missed it. "I wish I was there. I wish I was there." She was such a light and a guiding force that I enjoyed so much. When I came into this position, I had never managed people. I'd never lived in an ashram. So with her guidance and all her years of knowledge—from Sahaja Yoga, from just being a manager at a bank—all these things helped me grow so much. I'm so indebted to her. I feel she was definitely somebody that we've been together with in a past life. There was just so much joy that she always brought to the school. She's missed. I'm trying not to cry because she's a very great soul.

Oh, thank you so much. It's really lovely. It's always been amazing to me how children loved Carolyn so much. I'm sure you saw that with her there. It was amazing. She was always "online" with all of us, but when it was children, it was a different matter. They were like her own little children. Every child she met was like her own. It was really amazing. Thank you.

So, yes. I think we have Sylvia, don't we? Out on the West Coast. I think she wants to say a few words. Do we still have Sylvia Dooling?

Oh, hi. Sorry. Hi, Betty and everyone. Thank you so much for inviting me. Hi. I'm sorry, I'm... there's a little delay, I think, in the Zoom. I'm in the car driving between Florida and Virginia.

But we can hear you, Sylvia. We can hear you well.

Oh, great. Okay. I won't put my video on because I think it'll be distracting. I'm sorry... Carolyn... I mean, it just flows from the heart, I think. So I'll just start with my realization in a library in Northern Virginia under the dear facilitation of Carolyn.

I remember that day so well, of course. I remember the way Carolyn introduced everything made so much sense that I just thought, "I can't wait to talk to this lady after the program." After the program, I nearly chased her and her husband, Belodia, out of the library. I just wouldn't let them go. Finally, Carolyn—you know how she was just full-on about everything and full of love—turned to me and said, "I would love to talk to you. Please give me your phone number. But my family's waiting at home. It's my birthday, and they want to celebrate." I almost followed them to her house.

For the next while, I felt like Carolyn's little child. Honest to God, I was 48 years old and I had just had my rebirth, and this was my new mother, sister, everything. Our relationship was everything to me. We talked about three times a week, and when we weren't talking, I was remembering the smallest and most beautiful little things that she did. I certainly remember about a year and a half after I'd been in Sahaj, she decided we would have dinner at her house. It was always beautiful. It was lovely china, which has been mentioned here, and it was done like a party, even though it was just Carolyn, her husband, and myself. We would listen to a talk and we would meditate. In one talk, Shri Mataji recommended that we spread Sahaj Yoga in the churches, to talk to the ministers. So she decided that we would write to ministers.

So we got out the phone book—this was 2001, 2002—and we selected three churches. One responded. It was a Unity Church in Virginia Beach, Virginia. We went there and Carolyn gave this minister, who was a lady, self-realization. We had a program there for a year. Nobody came. I mean, there were just one or two people each week. But Carolyn decided that it would be a great learning experience for me. So after being in Sahaj for really only about a year and a half, she had me giving programs. That was my real knowledge base.

You never really know anything until you teach it, and I had to immerse myself and talk about a subject that was still new to me. But under Carolyn's tutelage and guidance, she would be beaming, "Oh, that was a beautiful program!" She would always tell me that, even though I was falling on my face and blushing the whole time.

I don't know why, but with Anna Mantini—perhaps it was Anna's great passion—she and Anna decided that we would go to the reservation at Pine Ridge, South Dakota, which is the Lakota reservation that Anna had contacted through an amazing series of events, which I hope Anna will tell us about. I had never done anything like this before. I had never thought that I would take off from work and go to an Indian reservation and give self-realization. But it just didn't matter. If we were doing Mother's work, everything would be fine.

We really didn't have space in our brain to worry about anything when Carolyn was involved because her enthusiasm and absolute devotion—that absolute trust that if we were doing Mother's work, everything would work out—just overtook everything else. You were just thoughtless because you didn't want to miss any of this amazing stuff going on. It was sort of that faith that you could see working through Carolyn and Shri Mataji.

So we went there and we gave realization. People came from Colorado. Yogis came—Alia Einstein and her new husband. Anna came. People came from Canada—Regina and Christina. So it became so collective. What an amazing, amazing thing to have happen when you're only in Sahaja Yoga for four years at that point.

...and they came and brought gifts to Shri Mataji. And that was all Carolyn and Anna together, their amazing energy. So... there are almost too many memories to recount. But everyone has said so much here, and it's just palpably true that any time you were in the presence of Carolyn... you just felt like Sahaja Yoga was... you maybe thought that Sahaja Yoga was the answer, but when you were with Carolyn, there was no doubt in your mind. This is the way we're going to save the world.

So, I hope I haven't run over time. I don't remember what my time allotment was, but I'll end there and just say thank you so much for the beautiful memories and beautiful vibrations today. Jai Shri Mataji. Jai Shri Mataji. Jai Shri Mataji.

Thank you so much for sharing with us. We are at about 3:30. I don't know if...
