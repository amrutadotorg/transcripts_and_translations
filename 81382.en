 (England)
Thank you so much for joining this evening for a recollection of your times with Shri Mataji and how she got you to set up what is called an ashram. Now, ashram is a very old term. It's a Sanskrit word; it's a spiritual retreat, a place of learning. So when was it that Shri Mataji actually asked you to get together, to live together so that you could meditate and do Sahaj and actually ascend together? How did that come about? Would you like to start, please, Maureen?

*

Well, first of all, we were meeting at one of the yogi's houses, and Pat and I did stay there for a while. That was in North Gower Street in London. But then Shri Mataji organised for us to get a place in Acton. It was Acton Lane, wasn't it?

Yes, that's right. And I actually went there on the tube with Shri Mataji to look at it first.

Which year is this?

'77, it must be. Yes, must have been '77. It was some months before we started public programmes. It was on the 15th of August when we went with her. And then she actually paid for the deposit on it. Do you remember?

I remember that more with Finchley Road. With Acton, all that happened was I went there with her on the tube, which is quite a long journey. I looked at the place, that's all. And again, it was a flat over a shop, I think, wasn't it?

I don't know if it was over a shop. No, it was on the first floor, that's for sure. It was a flat on the first floor.

Okay, yes. And it had a very loud train at the back. And at the front, we used to get really loud lorries braking all the time because it's on a hill. There were only about four or five of us there, weren't there? Christine, yourself, Pat, me, and Gus.

There's a handful of you in 1977 then, isn't it? What was ashram life like then in this first place that you got on Mother's instructions?

Well, not just Mother's instructions. Mother actually got it for us and paid for everything. We didn't have the... she really got the whole thing going.

How did it happen? So she was in Ashley Gardens then at that time?

No, she wasn't in Ashley Gardens. It was Hersham Green then, I'm sure. It was in Hersham Green.

So she said, "Okay, so this is a place I've got for you." Take us through those conversations, please. Pat?

Well, I can't remember exactly. It was a long time ago. But I think basically Mother started talking about it. And also, Maureen, you asked for a boon in India, didn't you, that we could get one?

Yes.

And then one day Mother asked me to go out with her, which happened quite often. We'd go out looking at houses or all sorts of things, really. Shopping in Oxford Street, or meeting people at the airport. I'd drive her out and back. And which was quite a surreal experience, sitting at the airport with Shri Mataji, having tea, on our own, waiting for someone to turn up.

Anyway, all I remember is that Mother asked me to come with her. So we went on the tube all the way to Acton and found the place. I think it's a bit of a walk from the station. And we went and saw it. And I suppose we must have seen the landlord. I don't remember that particularly. And then got the tube and went back again. That's all I can remember.

Do you remember the date, Pat? Maureen must have it somewhere, because she kept a diary.

Yeah, I'll have to look it up. Sorry.

Okay. When I went with Shri Mataji on the 15th, we were on... it was the 15th of August, I remember. And she said, "Today, why, there's lots of vibrations." And it was Assumption Day. So there must be lots of people worshipping Mary, the Virgin Mary, she said. And she said, "We're going to go to this place, because we're booking this place, this ashram."

And we went. And the guy who drove us was, you remember, he was the builder, or the guy who was doing the renovation for Ashley Gardens. He was a fellow who looked more South American to me or something. Anyway, he took us and he drove us there. And I remember she probably must have paid the money or the deposit and booked it for us. And then we definitely must have moved immediately after the 15th of August.

Right. And we weren't there very long at all, were we?

We must have been there at least a month and a half, at least.

About that. Jamal, you and I were sleeping in the lounge, weren't we?

Yes, I was there for two weeks with you, and then I left to go home. I had to come back later.

You were still a student, Jamal?

Yeah, I was still a student then. I'd just finished my degree, in fact.

Well, we were really still finding our way as to how to meditate and what to do.

So what was a day like in the life of the Sahaja Yogis?

It was like a few seekers in a flat together trying to find their way. And we were working. We were going off and working and stuff. So, it felt very experimental, I think is the best way to put it.

Actually, Maureen and Pat, I think it wasn't exactly true, because you knew exactly how to meditate. In the morning, you remember, we used to get up early, we used to say all the mantras for all the chakras. We would meditate. And it was very powerful, actually. It was extremely powerful.

It was our first time of having somewhere where we could all do that together, really. Although we had done that in Gavin's place before. But there were less of us. But also in that Acton ashram, we had Gus, who was even newer. So he didn't... I can't remember what he did, but he was hardly sort of prepared for ashram life.

So from this ashram where you stayed for about a month, a month and a half, what happens next?

We carried on as usual, living there and meditating. And then Mother said we had another ashram to go to. I can't remember how it was brought up.

Did Mother visit you there in this first one?

I'm trying to remember. I don't think so. I don't think she came when we were there. But she definitely came to the next one. Oh, very much so. Several times.

So which was the next one and when, please?

Regent's Park Road. So it would have been over September, October. October-ish time. End of September, beginning of October, 1977. And we went to look at another place just before that, further down the road as well, before it was settled. And then Mother again did everything with the landlord and paid the money. Paid the rent, paid the deposit or whatever. It was amazing.

And we all tried to get jobs. Well, basically, we had been hippies. We'd given everything up. And Jamal was a student, so none of us had established places as such. Or had the money for deposits.

You remember that place? It was just above a kind of DIY shop. He was the owner, actually. And we had a kitchen downstairs, dining room, where we all cooked. Shri Mataji used to come to that kitchen and sit around that table. And we had a little garden out the back where we had a Havan with her.

It was such a tiny garden, yet we managed to have a whole thing with Mother. Heaven knows what the neighbours...

She read the Vishnu Sahasranama.

Oh, Vishnu Sahasranama. Wow.

Yeah, she read the whole Vishnu Sahasranama.

That would have taken a while?

Yeah, but it was quite fast with Shri Mataji. Amazing. It was pretty amazing. That was, I think, my first big Havan. I don't remember a Havan before that.

It was the first big one in London. I don't think it was that big.

No, I know, but it felt big. Well, everything with Mother felt big. Even if there was only...

As in time, or as in intensity?

In importance, in intensity. Everything with Mother felt out of this world. You couldn't actually say it was small in numbers of people. But also, we had that drama with the fire brigade, didn't we? The night we moved in.

So, is this Regent's Park Road?

Yes.

Do you want to briefly share with us, please?

Oh, it was this chap that came. It was Jamel's friend, actually, who was visiting. And he said he could smell burning. And we all looked around. And he said, "I'm just going to get some advice from someone." And we were all looking around for this burning smell. And then this whacking great big fire engine pulled up, two of them, came all the way up the back. And next thing we knew, there were ladders up and firemen and a searchlight on the building and firemen climbing through windows. Completely crazy.

And then they called the landlord as well. And he turned up. And it turned out it was just the potatoes burning in the oven. It was completely crazy.

Oh, wow. Thank God for just the potatoes in the oven.

It was like a movie. You couldn't believe it was happening.

Did it have consequences with the landlord?

Well, if so, I think poor Shri Mataji had to take... she had to sort of calm him down. Because she had taken the assurances that we were all good, upstanding people. Because when he came after the firemen had gone, we were busy clearing the house with Ajwan. And there was just clouds of smoke everywhere. And I was in the lounge with this huge thing burning, and it was all full of smoke, and discovered it was the landlord. And I tried to explain to him that we were just clearing the vibrations. He wasn't very impressed. But we got away with it all anyway. It was extraordinary.

And then Gregoire came to stay, didn't he? He came from... he was finishing The Advent. And going to Mother's house every day to talk to Mother and revise things.

And every day, Maureen... he'd come back with the latest changes. And we didn't have word processors those days. So Maureen had to retype everything every day.

I hired a typewriter for a week. And it took months.

Wow. So how long did it take?

About three months, I think. Three months to type The Advent. Wow. Because she must have kept revising it.

Every day for several hours. I was there. We used to go together, yeah, every day for several hours.

Any interesting conversations that you'd like to share from one of those visits, Jamal?

One thing that I remember was Gregoire was away. I don't know whether he had gone to the toilet or hadn't arrived or something. And she was correcting the text. And she was crossing a whole lot of lines. And then she said, "I'm going to do this for his ego." Because Gregoire was a very interesting character. He was quite argumentative. He was really defending his ideas. To defend his version of The Advent.

But Shri Mataji somehow didn't really agree to it because it had an intellectual incline to it. And she thought, "No, that's not the way." So she tried to really simplify it, make it a bit more accessible to the layman.

He had put the whole intellectual explanation of seeking at the beginning. And Shri Mataji said that was a big hammer that no one would get past.

That must have been difficult for him.

And he said that every day he'd go through it. And he told me every day he'd end up at Shri Mataji's feet saying, "You're right, Mother." But he was working out all that stuff to make it a perfect version of what the seekers could see. So he did an amazing job. That's completely fantastic.

So aside from The Advent, which in itself was a very time-consuming and attention-consuming task, what was the atmosphere in the ashram like?

We used to work on each other and do oil our heads on a Saturday. We got up at four in the morning, said all the mantras together. It was wonderful. And we were building up to the first public program as well. This was going on. Which was not that long afterwards, was it? It really wasn't that long.

And then we started having people come back to the ashram. That was mind-blowing. Lots of people. Lots of dramas went on. Remember when we were all working in Harrods together? And somehow we got that guy in carpets involved. Poor man. It was too much for him. He came and stayed in the ashram for a while and went quite bonkers. And we had all kinds of adventures with him.

But Shri Mataji came and she would see the new people in the sitting room. It was quite a big sitting room. We'd all just be all crammed in there and she would work on them individually. And so we were kind of learning as well. And for us, it was so exciting because here were new people. Here were people who were actually doing it instead of just us handful.

Did you feel anything... you know how children can be quite possessive about their mother?

Oh, no. No, it was wonderful. I didn't feel that.

This was '77. Still, October '77. From October...

No, not for me personally. I just felt... because we'd been desperate for people to have it. We'd told all our friends and they'd said, "Oh, fantastic," and then got off. You just couldn't believe that nobody could see what we'd found. And then for Caxton Hall to have a whole hall full of people and then follow-ups for people coming to the ashram or working on them... there were a lot of sessions like that, weren't there, Jamal?

Yeah, she worked tirelessly on so many... on us and so many people who used to come. And she used to be with a candle almost all the time. Sometimes also burning lemons and working with lemons on people. It was amazing. We went really deep, deep, deep down into the cracks of the problems, and she would go and find the source of the problem. Sometimes you can't imagine what the source of problems were. Like she would say, "Okay, you have this problem." And then she would take someone's hand and say, "What is this ring you have on your hand?" She would find that the ring is completely possessed and it's got a bhoot in it and then she would take it out. Or a necklace. Or she would say, "What kind of experiences do you have in the past? What about your father, your mother?" She would actually investigate until she finds where the problem is from. But she knows, of course, but she sort of works it out with the person.

It wasn't just on an everyday level. All this exercising things from people, and you could almost feel them and be aware of them being pulled out of people. And it was really quite, quite extraordinary. I suppose everything was extraordinary, but it wasn't like Miss Marple investigating jewellery. It was like the Goddess investigating every dimension that these people have been through.

We would also go back to... then Mother got Ashley Gardens and we would go there after Caxton Hall every Monday, go back to her house.

Which is where you'd have nice dinners with her and sometimes she would cook for you all.

Not necessarily there. She cooked in Hersham Green, but at Ashley Gardens not so much. But there was always a couple of servants who did some of the cooking and Mother would just do things if she particularly wanted to. Not us though.

And this is, you're still at Regent's Park Road.

I was missing by the end of it because that's when I got thrown out of the collective for being caught up. I wasn't clearing out enough. I mentioned it in that other video where I caught flu, really bad flu twice in succession. As soon as I started getting better from the first lot, I got it from the second lot and I was absolutely in a dreadful state. So I moved out and I got a bed-sit around the corner. And Maureen used to sneak out and see me sometimes.

Eventually I got called back into action when we got to the next ashram, which was Dollis Hill. There weren't enough people to pay the rent, I think partly, but also they were a strange bunch of people who ended up there. I think when I moved there, everyone was in India.

And then how many more? Because the first ashram had just a handful of you, wasn't it?

Yeah. But we had one or two other people kind of around after Caxton Hall. Regis and Chaya were there at Dollis Hill. All sorts of people were. We moved into Dollis Hill and there were all sorts of people there.

So this would be '78, 1978 sometime?

Yes, it must have been. I went there, I was only there for a term of college and I went there and that was 1980 though. It was coming up to the time Maureen and I got married. So I think I would have been there from about Easter 1980, but it was established well before that.

You must have had it a couple of years then.

I think so. Well, I know that Mark and I, we went to a wedding at Dollis Hill the night before our first year exam. So that would have been like June 1979. And Shri Mataji organised a wedding at Dollis Hill ashram. She just produces couples from somewhere who wanted to get married.

They were not yogis?

No. Wow. So we had a wedding out the back in the garden. We all attended. Amazing. And Shri Mataji attended. And it's like everything Mother did. It was all illustrative. You just knew you were learning something and there was something going on.

That must have followed after some time for you all, wasn't it?

Yeah. And then that night after the wedding, I think it must have been about one in the morning, Shri Mataji was going back to Victoria to Ashley Gardens in her car. And she gave Mark and I a lift down to Ashley Gardens. And as we were saying goodbye to her, it must have been about two in the morning by then. We happened to mention to her that we got our first year exams the next day. And she said, "And you still came," you know, as if you wouldn't. We were so pleased that we'd bothered to come along.

Yeah, so that date I remember very well. So that was, and it was established, obviously, but it was still sort of early days for it. So that sort of June.

We did a lot there, didn't we? The signing of The Advent for our copies. The inauguration of India House. Mother just gave each one of us a copy and wrote something in it before she gave it to us. It took me years before I got it translated.

There are some miracle photos from Dollis Hill of Shri Mataji sitting and signing The Advent.

I mean, at one of the times at Dollis Hill, I can remember Shri Mataji sat for eight hours without moving. And we were able to actually get up and go to the loo or get a drink or whatever, but she sat there the whole time.

[Photo shown] So this is Sahastrara Puja in Dollis Hill in 1980. Oh, this person down there is myself. In red on the right corner. It was my first ever puja in Sahaja Yoga. I think I was two weeks in Sahaja Yoga when I went to the ashram. Somehow, I got the address of the ashram.

Dollis Hill went on for a long time. Any stories that you'd like to share of Dollis Hill ashram?

I don't know if Maureen or Pat remembers this Puja, which was probably a Sahastrara Puja. I was not in London then. I had gone back to Algeria for a few months. And I used to come to London every month because I was working with an airline. And I remember one day, I had a plane from Algeria to London, and I arrived late. And somehow, when I went to the check-in, they said, "Okay, no, you can't go. That's it. We've closed the flight."

And then what happened was, I met a friend of mine from secondary school. And he was a pilot with Algerian Airlines. And then he went to the check-in desk. He said, "Come on, guys, we work with you. You should let him get on the plane." And ultimately, they called the pilot, and the pilot said, "Yes, he can come in." So I managed to get into the plane and sit. And when I arrived, the pilot said, "Yes, we've been delayed because the French army were doing exercises over the Mediterranean."

So fortunately, because of that delay, I was going to this puja in Dollis Hill. And when I arrived in Dollis Hill, I arrived late. And when I arrived, then they started the Aarti. And I did the Aarti with them. And Shri Mataji, of course, was there. It was, I think it was a Sahasrara puja, but I'm not entirely sure. And then, at the end of the Aarti, I think one of the yoginis or something came to me and said, "You know, Shri Mataji said, 'Don't start the Aarti yet. Jamal is coming.'"

Wow. And she knew I was on the way. And she stayed the Aarti. And I thought that was so amazingly thoughtful of Shri Mataji just to... she knew that somehow, a yogi was coming and she had to delay the start of the Aarti.

And there would be about 15, 20 of you by this time or more?

The room was pretty full, actually. Lots more. Lots more than that. I think more. Because that's just the front you're seeing there. It was a through lounge. It's one of these sort of 1930s built semi-detached houses. And the wall had been knocked through and there was sort of four double doors between the front lounge and the back lounge. So it was all effectively one room. So, yeah, we often had like 30 or more people in there. Packed, absolutely packed.

The other thing that we had in Dollis Hill was all the TM people coming. So that was a huge upheaval. Because they were so caught up. And Mother was exercising them. Really exercising. Mother came to Dollis Hill quite a lot. She'd sort of turn up on spec and just sit and talk to us.

All the time. I remember once we ended up having one room for Mother at the front, upstairs, with a bed in the middle. And we often used to sleep on the floor around it. I remember I went to sleep there once. Everyone had gone to a program with Mother. I went to sleep on the floor in my sleeping bag. And about three in the morning, suddenly all these noises. The door flew open. The light was turned on. And Shri Mataji walked in with thousands of ladies. And I had to stand up and hop out of the room in my sleeping bag quickly.

Mother would sit in that chair and have us work on her. And she would ask one or two of us to press on her back. And she would say, "Oh, just press harder. You won't hurt me." And she would be sitting there with one foot across her knee, very relaxed, eating chana and drinking tea or drinking water. And there would be two of us behind Mother with all our strength. And it really did deny the laws of physics, because we would have pushed a car with that much force. And Mother was just talking, laughing, working on people and telling us things and eating chana. She wouldn't move.

And it was, at the time, it didn't really seem strange. Because it was just Mother asking us to do something. And we did it. Nothing seemed strange, no matter how it was. But if I think about it, I could push a car with one hand. I mean, not quick. But I was a lot skinnier but still quite strong. If I was to push someone at their back, I would push them off the chair, even if they were braced with two feet. But Mother sat with one leg across her knee and just talking, eating chana, drinking tea, as lighthearted as you ever saw her. And there would be two of us pushing her back with all our might. We weren't pretending. With all our might, she would just say, "Oh, you won't hurt me. Just push harder."

Yeah, she always would say push harder. Well, it's like that. When you were rubbing her feet, she'd say, "Rub harder, rub harder." And you'd be absolutely exhausted.

What was it like? What did Shri Mataji's feet feel like?

It was hard work. It was really hard work. Because she had a lotion called Pretty Feet. And it was like a foot cream rather than a hand cream. And we would rub this into Mother's feet. And it was a real chore. And then Mother would say, "Oh, yes, thank you. Put your head on my feet." And you'd put your head on Mother's feet. And like your head was going to explode. I've never felt such pressure anywhere. But because Mother was working out... we weren't working on Mother, obviously. We were being worked on. And it was astonishing, really. Mother's feet felt both incredibly strong and incredibly soft at the same time.

But I must say, I was not very good at it. Shri Mataji asked me to rub her feet. And I was sweating all the time. It was hard work. And Shri Mataji looked at me and she said, "Oh, good." And she asked this big man to take her feet and massage them because I don't think I was doing a good job.

I actually got a memory as well of that because I remember being at Brompton Square and Shri Mataji often used to ask us to rub her feet. And on one occasion, she said, "I want you to pull my toes." And I thought, "Really?" She said, "Yes, pull my toes. They're just like taps. And whichever toe you're pulling, you're going to get the vibrations into your chakra from that particular toe."

And I remember I was pulling, I think it was the right heart or the left heart, one of the two. And I was pulling. She said, "No, harder, harder, harder." And you think, "No, I can't go any harder." But Mother said it was completely beyond... and you're just being flooded with vibrations. And it was a lovely experience I had with her from actually rubbing her feet.

And I also remember after some public programmes, Mother's chakras would be whirling around so much after giving her vibrations to the whole hall that she'd get Warren to kind of work on her. And I remember him sort of putting his hands on her back and his head was getting redder and redder. All the vibrations coming into him. And it was helping Mother, I think. Sometimes we didn't suck enough. We didn't take the vibrations enough out. And so we had to sort of literally put hands on them to help Mother take these vibrations.

So that's Dollis Hill. And it kind of gets everybody firmly into Sahaja Yoga. The family grows. And you're there for about two, two and a half years. Is that right? And then what's next?

Chelsham Road. The story that we told before, basically, of getting the keys. So we know the date of that because it was the 25th of July, 1980, when we got the keys and we went in there.

When did you move in, Graham?

Well, I was going to Caxton Hall programmes. And I'd also got my realisation in Hampstead at the Friends Meeting House. I think the first meeting that Hester arranged in Hampstead at the Friends Meeting House.

Was this 1980, Graham?

Yes, I think so, June 1980. One of the first ones. It was amazing because I'd met Hester before and she just sort of said, "Oh, hi, this meeting." And so I did. And I remember Mother turning up wearing this beautiful white sari and she looked absolutely queenly as she sort of flowed into the room. And then we had the normal realisation programme. And I remember being worked on by some yogis after that. And Mother sort of coming towards me. And I was sweating and I was feeling so hot. And this lady behind me was raising my right side and pushing my left down. And Mother sort of came closer and her eyes were very close. And she said, "No, no, no, he's left-sided. Raise his left side, raise his left side." And I had a fantastic experience. And all I can remember is leaving the hall and it looked like a battlefield with people and bodies strewn all over the floor.

It was very, very proactive and not just sitting on the stage and not interacting. But she really did work very hard on all of us. And with the new people, it was like a battlefield. We used to have to stagger back to the ashram afterwards and try and foot soak and clear ourselves out and recover from it each time. But it was great. We loved it.

So how did Chelsham Road come about then?

Well, I suppose Mother asked Linda to buy it, isn't it? Just Linda. And she got it. And that was another miracle. I think she's probably told that story. I don't know it in detail.

Well, I don't really have the story, but I do know that it was a miracle how she got the money. Somehow. She bought it with one pound. There was something crazy, wasn't it? Something like that. She had to sell her house in Cross Cray to get the money. But Dollis Hill continued along at the same time for some time because Dollis Hill was rented and Linda bought the house. It wasn't just given up straight away.

I can just tell you a little bit about the house because I moved there just after Linda bought it. So the house was a ruin. It had been hit by a bomb, hadn't it? It was a complete ruin. What you see as a meditation room now, it hardly existed. Everything had to be changed and rebuilt. And the kitchen was upstairs. It was a very different layout. And I don't really remember where we meditated because there was nowhere very much to meditate. But I think we managed to find a place.

But the thing is, everything was a little bit of a chaos because people living there... I was not working. I could look after the place with Chaya, but people who lived there, they were working. So I found myself starting at five o'clock in the morning and finishing at 11 at night. Just somehow everything was very difficult. Whatever we started to do, everything was sort of difficult and falling apart.

I can remember there were 16 of us living there at one point. And there was only one bathroom. And all I can remember is that all night long, an alarm clock would go off every hour for somebody to go off and have their bath. It was the only way we could do it. So it was actually very difficult. And people would say that this was sorting out the universe or maybe the heart of the universe, which was in a terrible state.

It was really like a building site, I remember. And I know that Pat used to go off with Peter in what you call the van, which was the "yellow peril." And it was so dangerous to be in. But he somehow managed to get all these wonderful doors. From Lloyd's Bank. Wasn't it Lloyd's Bank that they came from? He came back with them. And then we actually polished them all up and used electric planes on them and made them all fit wonderfully in that big meditation room.

But first we had to build it. We had to build the wall and everything. And I remember digging the foundations for the walls with Nick Kurzweil. And then we got a bricklayer in to actually do the bricks. But when Gosia and I got married there, there was still no roof.

From 25th of July 1980 till the 5th of December 1980, the Chelsham Road ashram was still a building site.

It was being renovated. But the building went on there for a long, long time. For years. Including the building of the top floor. But to begin with, it was just a lot of people living somehow all together. I don't think any of us have lived quite like that. So many people crammed into one house.

I remember the kitchen. You mentioned being upstairs, Grazyna. I remember going up there, having breakfast there. And they had that old sort of cooker with a grill above. And every day, I think, the toast would catch on fire. The flames would be going up through the top of the grill. And they'd come out black.

That's why we had to be there all the time. Because the cooking facilities were really bad. The washing up facilities were bad. It was a wonderful, chaotic, extraordinary experience, actually. Something completely out of this world.

And then would Shri Mataji come and visit you guys?

Yes, she used to come. We used to have Monday evening programs at Caxton Hall. And so loads of people would arrive, as well as people living there. And so Mother would come. And then we'd have a lovely evening with her. And we'd make a meal for her. And then she'd give a talk and then work on everyone there.

You remember that Shri Mataji, before December, asked everybody to stay up all night to concrete the floor.

Yes, I remember. We spent a lot of time staying up all night, if you remember. I remember we had, at one stage, Mother said we shouldn't eat for one day. And we shouldn't sleep. We should stay up all night. We were often up at night doing extraordinary things.

I lived there from January '84 to about May '87. So I spent about three and a half years. And I remember we used to, first we started actually getting up at 5 a.m. for meditation. And then, of course, we had a lot of work to do because we also were doing the cassettes. And we were basically the only cassette producing centre in the whole world at the time. We used to produce all the masters for every other centre internationally.

And I remember that the first two years, I think we used to get up at 5 o'clock. We used to do meditation, puja, aarti, the whole lot. And then I used to actually sleep in the afternoon. I would just sleep in front of my computer for about half an hour, an hour.

It was a real workout, getting up at 5, trying to get a shower beforehand when there's loads of other people queuing. And then we were very dedicated about doing the pujas first thing. And then we'd have breakfast and off we'd go to work.

And I remember that we used to get up at 5. And one day, she called the ashram and she said, "From now on, you have to get up at 4." So Elizabeth took it over to wake us up at 4. And it's true that you sort of get up and you knock your head around a bit. And they used to walk around with a bell. You could hear this bell ringing. And you could not ignore it. It was impossible. But that actually got everybody in.

I remember that very well. Also, the other thing was, Mother decided at one point that we should stop drinking tea. And this was terrible for English people, because we used to drink so much. I think you could only have like two or three cups a day at the most.

Mother said, well, you could drink tea, but no more than two or one cup. And we used to drink two or three cups an hour. And we used to have this tea, I remember in Dollis Hill too, with chai, with cardamoms and cinnamon. We used to have this really strong, stronger and stronger. So when someone came who wasn't used to it, they'd literally collapse after having a sip.

Well, Mother said that the way to give up tea was that if you stop having milk in it, half of you will give up. Stop having sugar, the other half will give up.

But then, Gail, you were there with children. So that was the next stage, wasn't it?

Yeah, because I had William then, my first child, and he was a baby. And it was quite challenging, I have to say. That's another side of ashram life, isn't it?

Which year is this then, Gail?

He was born in '82.

Can I just say a little story about 1980? Linda was pregnant with Dattatreya, her son, in Chelsham Road. And Shri Mataji rang the ashram. And she said, "Linda, it is time. Linda, it is time." So she asked to call the ambulance. I don't remember at the time. But we were on the way to the hospital, where she couldn't even reach Royal Free. She had to stop at University College. It was halfway, because she was delivering the baby. So actually, Mother knew exactly that she was going to deliver. And she was not aware of it, really, at the time. And her husband couldn't be at the birth of the baby, because he went to the wrong hospital. He went to the hospital where the baby was going to be delivered. So I was actually present at the delivery of the baby, which was a fantastic experience, I must say.

[Photos are shown]

Of course, we had the 16 marriages, of course, in the garden.

Yes. Was that 1980?

No. 1981. That was '81 or '82. I think it might have been a Krishna Puja.

Yes, there were 16 couples crammed into the garden. 16 marriages. I remember telling... we were actually doing programmes all over the UK. So the yogis from Chelsham Road would go out, and on one occasion, we went to Sheffield, where Gail was actually doing a public programme. That's where we met for the first time. And then we'd have a puja on the following day and come back.

A few weeks later, I think we were travelling on a train with Mother, and she said to Pamela, "Oh, who's that lady who lives up in Sheffield?" And I think Pamela said, "Oh, her name's Gail." And then Mother turned round to me, and she said, "Oh, Graham, I think you should marry Gail." I hadn't thought about marriage at all. So I said, "Yes, Mother," as you do. And then I said, "Oh, perhaps you'll forget about it." But eventually, a week later, she's like, "Have you phoned her yet?" And then, "No, sorry, Mother."

Eventually I did. And we had a sort of conversation, and we were saying that Mother thinks it's a good idea we should get married. What do you think about that? And she said, "Oh, yes, that's very nice and very good." So we arranged to meet, and that was history. I remember telling Gavin, because I was saying, "Look, Gavin, we're engaged. We're going to get married." He said, "Fantastic. Krishna puja, 16 couples. Couldn't have been better."

It was just a lovely, lovely thing. But beforehand, you had the whole Haldi ceremony in the garden as well. Mother took me down to Southall to buy all the jewellery for Gail. She was just so meticulous.

I do remember we were all in the garden, and there was a big vat of Haldi. Masses of it. And Mother was sitting in a chair in the garden, and we were all being decorated with the Haldi. And I remember Mother was laughing and laughing, she was enjoying this. And there was so much Haldi put on us. I mean, literally. It was like a mud bath. So that must have been the first sort of Haldi in the West.

Where did you wash? Because there was only one bathroom.

We all kind of shared the bath, the ladies, anyway. We sort of went in twos or threes and kind of helped each other. Because we were caked.

The lovely thing was a Pujari, an Indian Pujari came. And who probably does loads and loads of marriages. So he knows it off by heart. And every time he'd start saying something, Mother would say, "No, no, no, no, no." And she'd correct him. And then, "Yes, Mataji." And then he'd go on. And then, "No, no, no, no, no." And it was just so comic, actually, that everybody enjoyed it so much. We had a lovely little fire in the back which all the couples walked around. Just one fire for everyone. So that was an extraordinary moment and very, very funny.

No, we got married by Shri Mataji in Terminal 2 of Heathrow Airport. We were both very shy and we didn't think about going to India and actually having a full-fledged marriage like all the others. And what Shri Mataji did, when she matched us, she invited us to go with her to the airport because she was about to go to Spain.

And when we got there... she took us both to the airport in her car. When we got there, she took out some jewellery from her bag and she said, "Oh, it's funny, I've got these." She had a kind of Baroque-style ring and she had some earrings, a coral ring. And she gave them to Gilmour there and then. And she gave me some cufflinks, which were also with a coral stone on it. And she said, "That was it. You just now have to go and make it official."

What year is this then?

That was end of May, around the 28th of May, 1982.

After Chelsham Road went on for years with all kinds of people living there, the next stage was that we started... we got this new yogi who ran a housing association. And he said we could form a housing association ourselves and be allocated properties to look after for periods of time without paying rent. So we went for it, of course. And then we started getting all kinds of properties all over the place.

We had one actually near Judd Street. There was another one in Bayham Street near Camden Tube Station. And there was another one also on the other side of Camden High Street. Another house we had. And then we had that one in Warwick Road. It was a huge house. And then across from there, Bramham Gardens. It was a huge hotel, wasn't it? At Earl's Court.

When all the couples moved to Bramham Gardens, Shri Mataji and Sir CP were also there living in the basement. Periodically Mother would arise and come up into the main front room. And that's where we had these lovely meditations with her.

Which year then?

It would be '81. '82.

That was also where she declared the first leader who was going to be in charge of us. Because before that, you remember we used to have these meetings and everyone had to have a say and you'd have like 30 people in a room and it'd take hours and hours for each person to stand up and waffle for hours.

And I had to take all the minutes.

Yes, I know. It was crazy.

So we had all these places on the go, all these ashrams. And then the next one must've been Nightingale Lane, I suppose. And that was massive, wasn't it?

So, as you probably know, we did move into Nightingale Lane, which was, I believe, a nursing home at one time. So, it was pretty extensive. Had a huge garden at the back. Beautiful, actually. And lovely amenities, you know, big kitchen to cook in, lots of things like that. So, we actually did have a Guru Puja there, I believe it was in 1982.

I do remember when we were there, everybody was put on a liver diet. I remember that. And we had to have water on our cornflakes. And I was allowed milk because I had a baby and I was feeding the baby. I think, thank goodness, I got milk on my cornflakes.

We had rotas for doing the washing up. And there were so many people there. It used to take about two hours to actually do all the washing up after a meal. It was pretty big stuff, actually, in those days. But, yeah, lovely. Really nice.

Mother was building it up all the time. There was another ashram at Surbiton, wasn't there, as well? That was the one with the fire. They had a fire, didn't they? I know there was a fire at Chelsham Road. Mother's murti caught on fire from one of those oil lamps. And everyone was freaking out. And Mother said, "Don't panic, don't panic. Nothing's going to happen." And it was just poof and all gone. Completely controlled like that.

But we did have the fire brigade out for an Ajwan session. Because there was so much smoke coming out of the window. The neighbours called the fire brigade. Mother wanted us to do Ajwan, clear out the negativity. So we were all sitting under these long sheets, which everyone ran around the house to get together. And we all sat under this, with this great smoking brazier of Ajwan. And eyes watering and everything. And there was so much smoke that someone had opened the kitchen window, which was out to the front road. And the smoke was pouring out. And someone called the fire brigade, who turned up, knocked on the door. And we just opened the door and said, "Oh, no, no, sorry. It's just a little bit of incense." And we shut the door again. But there you are. Shri Mataji sitting with all of us, just collected like that. So wonderful.

So were you doing the Ajwan treatment frequently?

I think everybody in the ashram was actually doing it all the time. Oh, we did everything all the time. We had the onions on the head, dry roasted on the head. And then other people walking around with big red or black lines. And honey in our eyes. And the light bulb treatment. I remember because we had a room that was on the first floor and it had a frosted glass window. And people used to come to the light bulb that was bare. It was just a bare bulb. I used to see people's hands looming up like a shadow, putting a cloth on the bulb to then put on your left Vishuddhi.

Another problem was the lemons. Getting stuck in the toilet.

How would you dispose of them? Just bin them in the end?

Cut them up. Put them in the toilet. There were various kinds of ideas. Some people used to cut them up and some didn't. Some cut them one way and some cut them the other. And some took the top off and some didn't. And what did Mother say? A lot of it, somebody would tell you Mother had said, but you wouldn't be sure.

My only memory was burning the lemon when she was in Finchley. The lemons wouldn't burn until you use them on yourself. And then when you use them, they would go black when you put them to the flame. But you didn't have to put it in the flame, just near it. And we used to have to burn our actual hands over the candle flame. So you'd end up with a really black hand. Burn each finger for each chakra. And honey in the eyes.

When I was in the first place, when we weren't in the ashrams, I used to get up at half past three in the morning every day and do every treatment under the sun. I also used to drink half a glass of salt water for some reason. And honey in my eyes, Ajwan. And then I would do a full puja. And it would take two or three hours every morning. I was determined to explode into some higher world. And in the end, it got more and more. I did one... I remember, I read the whole of the Devi Mahatmyam doing the puja. And then I read all the thousand names of Shiva. And then I got a crushing headache for three days.

Nothing was too much. You just did everything you possibly could.

Well, I was desperate, because Mother said I'd exhausted every possible way to damage my chakras.

Shall we now take the topic of, very briefly, sharing each one of you, miracles that mattered to you when you were in one of these ashrams, please?

It was like one big long miracle, wasn't it? One of the seminars we went to, I think we'd been down to the West Country. And then on the way back, the lady who was with us, it was her parents' house that I think we'd used for the seminar. She was so full of vibrations, she couldn't remember the way to the station. So Shri Mataji took over and said, "Right, okay, we're going to go this way. And then we're going to go this way, this way, this way." And eventually we arrived. But then I said, "But no, I think we're about half an hour late." So she said, "Right, everybody out of the car." And so we all got out. And then I saw Mother, she was just giving bandhan, giving bandhan. And then she said, "Go over and ask the guard what's happening." So I walked over and the chap said, "Oh, don't worry. The train from London's half an hour late. It'll be here in a couple of minutes time." So we all trooped in, got on the train and then off we went. So it was just very miraculous, actually, like that.

I think what I can remember mostly was the fact that you had a very deep experience because you'd been working on your vibrations for a number of days, even months. When you reach a certain level, somehow Shri Mataji is aware of it. She talks to you and she says, "So you're trying to do this, aren't you?" She knows exactly what you're trying to do and how far up you've gone. Like one day she said to me... for about several months in Chelsham Road, I was meditating on that state of Lord Shiva above my Sahasrara. And I could feel actually that my attention would go and start to float in a dimension which is much higher than Sahasrara. And then when Shri Mataji saw me, she said, "So you're trying to get there, are you?" She knows exactly what you're doing and she knows where you are and what your efforts are. She can see it very clearly.

Most of the miracles I experienced like that were early on when we first met Mother. Remember that time we went to Three Bridges with that Indian community? We ended up, that's the first time we did that stick dancing. But at one stage, I was just sitting in front of Mother and suddenly I just became a reflection of Shri Mataji looking at herself. And I just was just stuck there, struck dumb. And then everything dissolved in this golden bliss. And then I kind of opened my eyes again and Mother was looking at me and she said, "Very good." It was a rare moment then because mostly I was in a dreadful state.

I think it was a magical time. Mother would come and I cooked for Mother.

What did you cook?

Grilled bacon and poached eggs. Mother said it was really nice because Mother had been told by the doctors she had to have, I think it was an all-protein diet. And this was way before all these fatty diets.

When in heaven was this?

This was when I was at Dollis Hill, so 1980. She came in and said, "Oh, I can only eat protein." So that was all we had, I think. We had bacon and eggs. So I grilled some bacon and poached a couple of eggs. It was very nice.

The whole thing... At Dollis Hill, she would often work on the yogis. And I saw her trick Peter Pearce's neck. And I've never seen anyone have their neck tricked so violently. He was quite a bit bigger than me. He was like a bull of a man. He didn't have a neck really. His head went straight to his shoulders. And Mother had him sit down on the floor cross-legged in front of her while she was sitting on this chair. And she tricked his neck. And I thought she'd killed him. Because it was such... bizarrely, although Mother was only about five foot, she had such upper-body strength. She tricked this guy's neck. And there was an awful, sickening sound. And he shook his head. He said, "Oh, thank you, Mother." Oblivious to what Mother had done. But that's the only time I was really freaked out. Because I thought... it was just massive. The most violent neck trick I've ever seen.

One of the things... we shouldn't do it.

We just assumed we were supposed to do it. All these poor new people would come to a meeting and get their neck tricked and stagger off. We had to stop it in the end.

Gail, is there anything you'd like to share with us?

When we were living in Bramham Gardens, sometimes you used to drive Mother. And one day, Mother had guests. I can't remember. They were from the Far East somewhere. I was pregnant, and I really had this craving for dates. I really, really, really wanted dates. And I hadn't said anything to anybody. And you'd been driving Mother, and when you came back in the evening, you said, "Oh, Shri Mataji's sent you a present." And it was the most enormous sort of branch full of dates that these guests had given to Mother. And then Mother gave them to Graham to give to me. So she... as we've been saying, she knows everything. Absolutely. And it was just so sweet, because I really wanted to eat dates.

Of course, as a diplomat, Sir CP was often invited to very high-profile dinner parties. And she actually said that she went to have dinner with Margaret Thatcher at 10 Downing Street. And she said, "Of course, they had all these gold plates and knives and forks and everything. But do you know what? At the end of the meal, they served this rhubarb ice cream for CP. He was ill for days after this." And she said, "I had to work on him. I had to work on him so much. This rhubarb ice cream was deadly." Very funny that she sort of wasn't impressed by all the showy stuff.

It occurs to me that we'll probably have to do another programme on Ashrams, because there's still a few to go.

Yes, we would, actually, because this is probably just the tip of the iceberg of memories from the ashram.

Thank you all so much. Maureen and Mark from the North of England. Pat and Grazyna from Sheffield. Jamal from France. And Graham and Gail from East Sussex. Thank you so much. Beautiful memories. Thank you, Shri Mataji, for these beautiful experiences you've given us all. Jai Shri Mataji.

Jai Shri Mataji.
