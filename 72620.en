Talk to Sahaja Yogis
Varanasi (India)
Talk Language: English | Transcript (English) – Draft

Your train has to leave. He is telling Me on one side. On the other side, he says, I must speak in English and explain to you what they are saying. It's very embarrassing, because they are praising Me to the highest. They find it impossible to translate it and according to them, it is all my grace, as they call it, Karam, that it has worked out.

For God, they have two names are like Rahim and Kareem. And Rahim is the one who loves, Rahimat, who forgives. And the Kareem is who is the one who does. So this language itself is a very symbolic language, and the way they are singing is also extremely symbolic. But what I liked about them, that they know very good classical music, and also rhythm was very good. Apart from that, you see, they are singing from the heart. It's not just to please Me or to please you.

When you sing from the heart, it's different and if you see their eyes are just shining. They are all Realized souls. Now I have to tell them, later on, about Mohammed Sahib, about Salimdha, and Ali, his two sons, all the history about them which they don't know. Then they will know what they are singing has such a meaning. So, they are all our own, they are all our relations and we all have to accept them as one of us.
May God bless you.

Shri Mataji said that now the government has intended to do something for us, and thy have decided that now the qawwals will go and spread the message of Sahaja Yoga for the unity. So, it’s a great thing for us. So, these are the people who are now Sahaja Yogis, and will work for us. And we’ll work together and see to it that how we can achieve that goal for which we have come on this Mother Earth. With the blessings of Shri Mataji.
