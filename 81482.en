I was with the Sahaja Yogis, but they were on a boat in the middle of a lake. I thought, well, I want to go and join them. There was a guy with a punt, so I stepped on it and said, "Will you take me to the boat?" Off he went, and the punt sank. So I hopped back onto the bank, and he came out. The punt bobbed up again. I got onto it again, he went out, and it sank again.

I got back on the shore and said to myself, "Well, what am I supposed to do here?" And this voice said to me, "Keep the faith."

Then I realized the Sahaja Yogis weren't actually on the boat. They were standing around it on the water. I was just supposed to walk across the water to join them. Basically, what this was telling me—because I was concerned about getting married—was what Mother was saying to me: "Don't worry, it's working out."

The next very strange dream I had was that it was my wedding day, and I was in bed with this woman, which I thought, "Oh, that's really weird."

Then a couple of days later, we went to... where was it we met? I can't remember the name of the place. Goa? No, where I met you. One of the hotels. The hotel was there. Ranjan asked me what I liked. I said to my little brother, "Whatever you like, let me eat it." My brother said to me, "What are you doing? What are you doing like that?" Yes, you were pointing to Uncle Douglas. And my father said, "Do you understand what he said?" I said, "You were both the same." My brother told him that I have seen a boy for your sister.

Right, now, Casey College... wasn't the meeting at Casey College? I think it was, yes. Casey College. I told Ranjan to bring your father and sister to meet me after the Sahaja Yoga meeting finished.

Anyway, at that time, I was doing all the recording. When we were at Casey College, Mother said to me, "Go with Ranjan, because I want you to meet his sister. That's the girl that I've selected for you." So, I went and met her. Then we went to a local restaurant and we had these thalis, which seemed like dustbin lids—huge thalis of food. They seemed enormous. Anyway, he said to me, "What do you feel?" The vibrations were incredible. So, what more need I say?

The next day, I came from where we were staying at Sion Koliwada, or something like that, outside of Bombay. The idea was that I would go the next morning. In the evening, I went to see where they lived, and the next day I came to meet them, to go and tell Shri Mataji what we'd arranged.

So, the next day, I went to their house at Tardeo. Then, we got some sweets and went to see Shri Mataji at Kalpana's house. Both of us, yes.

Mother said, "So, what have you decided?"

And I said, "Oh, yes, it's definite." She sort of exploded in... well, the way she would... she exploded in joy and pleasure. Her eyes opened, she took on a big smile, and she was so happy.
