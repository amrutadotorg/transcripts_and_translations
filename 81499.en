 (England)
Jai Shri Mataji, Felicity. It's very nice to have you this morning on the 1st of December 2023 to share your lovely memories with Shri Adi Shakti, Shri Mataji herself. It's been an amazing morning. It's been frosty, a very, very heavy frost. It snowed—didn't settle on the ground—and the sun's shining now. So we've had all weather. It's really quite special.

Would you please start with sharing your journey of seeking and how it brought you to Shri Mataji?

So I was thinking about this, and I would say my consciousness of seeking God really began when I was 14. I just suddenly seemed to sort of wake up in the world and become aware of the bigger world around me. And I remember feeling this joyful feeling inside that, "Oh, life is what you make of it. I can make this a good life." That lasted for a little bit, and then a whole bunch of family stuff came in. We had illnesses, breakdowns, fires, all kinds of things, which I think were just to distract me in a way.

But through all of that, there was always this feeling. We didn't go to church. My father was a very dharmic man, and when I was 13, we stopped going to church because we had a new canon. My father felt that he was just interested in social stuff, that he didn't have the depth, and so we stopped going. But somehow, I had that feeling inside me: there is God. And I wanted to find him. I wanted to find him.

I had a difficult time all through the last part of my teenage years, and then I went to university. I was 19. I remember arriving at university and settling in, and just suddenly feeling like, what am I doing here? What is my life about? I want to be with God. I want to find God. I remember feeling very desperate. I happened to have a copy of the Bible, so I grabbed the Bible. I thought, "Oh, I'll look through here," looking for some answers, something. I'm looking through, my mind going, "No, no, there's nothing here." And I put it down. I just had such a desperate feeling.

And then I heard this voice. I felt this voice. Forty years later, I can recognize it. You can feel when it's the voice of God, when it's divine. It resonates through you. It's like it blocks everything else out, and there's just this voice. And this voice said to me, "When the time is right, I will come for you." I just was comforted. I felt comforted, and I went, "Okay, I just have to keep doing what I'm doing."

So I finished university. It wasn't easy. I really worked too hard and felt I'd lost the joy. When I finished, I said, "Okay, I've done everything my parents wanted. I've got the degree. Now my life is for myself. And I'm going off to find the joy that I've lost." So I booked a ticket and went with a small travel group that was traveling from Turkey to India. My goal was to go to Australia, where my mother was from, and I would visit all these countries on the way. I was just off.

I had very interesting experiences. It was quite quick traveling through Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan, and then I got to India. It was like a totally different place. I'd been through all these Muslim countries, and suddenly there I was in India, a predominantly Hindu country, even though I came through the north. I started in Amritsar, came down through Haridwar on the Ganges, and I was just blown away by the color, the vitality. Everyone lived close together. Nobody minded the noise. And I just went, what is this country?

Because you have to understand, in those days, 1979... I'm traveling in November 1979. There was no internet then. I left university and I got a job at the airport for three months, saved enough money so I could go traveling. I left in September, went to Greece, got to Turkey in October, and then it took about a month through those countries to get to India. But there was just TV and radio and newspapers, and you were very limited by what they presented. So I realized my vision of India when I got there was of famine and drought because that's all the pictures that we saw at the time. No internet, nothing. So it was really eye-opening for me.

To travel through those Muslim countries as well, to be exposed to the different religions, was an experience. And when I got to India, I felt that the Hindu religion actually had the deeper understanding. They were very tolerant of all religions, and that's what I felt. By the time I got to India, I realized that actually, in their depths, all the religions were the same. It was all about being with God, devotion, and having that. There was this oneness that went through underneath all the religions.

Anyway, so then I traveled down through India. I had a boat ticket from Madras to Jakarta, then to Singapore, Penang, and then I had a flight to Sydney. I counted up all my money, and I said, "I'm going to stay in this country as long as my money lasts." So I had a hundred pounds, which went a long way in those days. A couple of rupees bought you a full meal, and the most expensive thing was travel. Anyway, I spent about five and a half months there. I traveled from the north down the west coast. I arrived in November, and it was too cold to go up north, so I had to go south first. So I decided to come down the western coast.

I came down to Kerala. On the way, every so often, I'd have this really strong desire inside... I'd see someone on a train traveling, and there were a lot of young Westerners. I wasn't a hippie, I wasn't on the hippie trail, but there were a lot of hippies. And I discovered there were quite a lot of false gurus in India at that time. I met someone who'd been to one of them. I met a fellow who'd been to Rajneesh. I met someone who'd been to the false Sai Baba. And I asked about three or four people at different times, prompted by this inner voice, "Ask them." And I'd ask, "Have you been anywhere?" I was sort of looking for a yogi in the mountains. "Have you been anywhere? Have you seen anything?" Inside, I was just asking. And each time, they would say, "Oh, yes, I went to so-and-so. Don't go there. He's just there for people's money," or "He's just preying on young people." And it was like, okay, okay, this is all new to me.

Then after about five months, I ended up in the Periyar wildlife sanctuary. It was beautiful. And the second or third night, this seeking came up in me again. My friend on my travels had given me a copy of the Upanishads, this beautiful Vedic text. Literally, it's poems of being one with the Divine. It's just all about the beauty of God. I just opened this book and started reading, and I just went, "Ah, this is what I want. I want this."

So the next day I left and moved into a different hotel. In that hotel were two young Australian men. I saw them walking up and down the corridor, and again, this desire came over me: "Ask them, have you been anywhere? Have you seen anyone?" And I'm going, "No, no, I don't want to ask them. I don't know them." I was really reluctant. Finally, I couldn't help it. I asked one of them, "Have you been anywhere?"

"Oh, yes," he said. "We just met this lady a few weeks back. I felt all these things on my hands. It's kind of gone off a bit for me, but my friend had a very deep experience. He won't really talk about it much because it touched him so deep." So I didn't know anything, but he gave me a copy of Sahaja Yoga, The Unique Discovery. This was the standard leaflet. It was quite big, A3, bigger than letter size. It had the black and white picture of Mother at the top, the standard one that we use, and then it had a lot of information.

I took it with me into my room, and I went to sleep. That night, I had insomnia, which was a problem I had at that time. I had recurrent insomnia and eating problems. In the leaflet, it said Mother could cure anything. And I thought, if she could fix my sleeping and my eating problems, I felt my life would be back on track. I would be going where I was supposed to be going. Because the sleeping, everything was so distracting. Your attention had to keep going onto your physical being and not just on the joy of living.

So I wrote to her. I said, "I'm down in the south. I'd like to meet Shri Mataji. How can I do this?" And I put a postbox in Bombay. So I'm on my way back up. I'd arranged to meet a friend in Delhi. It's so funny how all these little things come together. I get to Mumbai, open my postbox, and there is a letter. Someone wrote back to me—I don't know who it was, bless them—and said, "Shri Mataji is coming to the end of her tour. She will be back in Delhi for the last week of programs." And it was the exact dates that I had arranged to meet my friend. So I thought, good, okay, this is all lining up.

But the day before I was to get on the train to go to Delhi, I suddenly started to get this... I can't describe it as anything other than a fight going on in my brain of whether I should take that train the next day or wait another day and do more sightseeing. It was like two people arguing in my head. And whatever I decided, after 10 seconds of quiet, the other one would start again. "No, no, no, you should do this." It went on all afternoon until I couldn't bear it any longer. I flushed the ticket down the toilet. I go, "Okay, that's it. That's the end of that conversation. I'll get another ticket tomorrow and go the following day."

So the next day, I spent all day lining up for a new ticket. Didn't get to do any sightseeing, nothing. And off I go on the train. Halfway to Delhi, we pass a train wreck. And I realized, "Oh, my God, that's the train I was supposed to be on." And I just thought, somebody's looking after me. I should have been on that train.

So I arrive in Delhi on Holi day. I didn't know what this was. I come off the train and start walking through the streets to get to my hotel, and the streets are deserted. I'd been in India for five months; I know that in India, there are people everywhere. And there are people giggling up in their windows, and I see paint splodges all along the road. Then somebody laughs from up top and says to me, "You should get off the streets." I realized later, you're a target. But nobody did anything. There was a lot of respect in those days for English people, for Westerners. There weren't so many touring around. And I found the Indians, the whole of my time there, nothing but gracious, respectful, and courteous. Hospitable. I did meet one or two people that I had my doubts about, but in general, I was pretty protected, and protected by other Indians. I think some of them were quite shocked that a 22-year-old young Westerner was traveling alone. Somebody even said to me, "How does your father let you travel alone?" I had to explain to people that we weren't all promiscuous and debauched in the West because that's all they saw on the TV.

Anyway, I settled into my hotel and I found the address they'd given me where Mother was going to be. And I thought I'll go the next day. So the next day off I toddle. I must have got a rickshaw to take me to this address, and I think this was 10 Ashoka Road in Delhi. I arrived at the gate; it's a little bungalow set back within a bit of land, and at the back of the land, they'd set up a pandal where they were having public programs. Gregoire met me, bless him, and welcomed me in. I think he said, "We'll have tea in a little while." I just remember sort of hanging around, and people didn't pay me much notice. Then we had tea.

At that point, my chakras... this was '79. I'd been through such a lot in my life. My chakras were very blocked, and life was in monochrome for me to some extent. Shri Mataji, I just saw her; she was part of that. I think she tried to talk to me a little bit, but I can imagine... when I've seen later people coming in who are quite damaged in some ways, you can see they're not connecting, so you just sort of leave them be.

Then they said, "We're having a program in the evening." I must have gone away and come back and gone into the tent. It was full of mature people, like Indian businessmen like my dad. There was only one other new Western person, and then half a dozen or so—I think there were 12 yogis traveling with Mother on this tour. This is the spring of '79. I sat at the back and Shri Mataji talked in Hindi, so I had no idea what was going on. Then two ladies came and worked on me, I think it was Marie and Mandy, and I just couldn't stop thinking. I didn't even know you weren't supposed to stop thinking. Nothing happened. I didn't get anything. They said to me, "You're thinking. Come back tomorrow night." But I saw other middle-class Indian people, suddenly after their realization experience, going like that and rushing up to bow at Mother's feet. So I thought, what's going on here?

But I came back the next night and, having been forewarned, I really tried not to think. Again, Mother spoke in Hindi the whole time, but then they came and worked on me again. I didn't know what my left side was, just a flash, but they said to me, "You've got it. You've got it. Go up and meet Shri Mataji." So I went up and I knelt in front of her and she said, "Good, good. Very good." She said, "Are you vegetarian?"—obviously picking up on my Nabhi problem. I said, "No, no, I'm not vegetarian." And then that was sort of it.

I got my rickshaw, went back to my hotel, and went to have my dinner. Suddenly I realized I'm sitting, eating my food, and there is no thought in my head about what I'm eating. Nothing. Usually I had this constant conversation around food: "Oh, should you eat this? No, you shouldn't eat this. If you eat that, you're going to get fatter." And I went, wow. I would enjoy living life like this. Then I went to bed and slept so deeply. I woke up and thought I'd been asleep for 14 hours, but it wasn't that long. And so then I thought, whoa, there's something here. See how Mother picked up on the things that were bothering me, and she goes, "Okay, I'm hooking you in. This is your hook."

So I went back the next night. And as I was going to the program that night, I realized that this nice mood I'd been feeling, which I hadn't been aware of, had gone. Obviously my Kundalini dropped down, and I went, "Oh, what was that? That was nice." So I went to the program, and it must have been near the beginning of that week. What I noticed, actually, when I first arrived at the bungalow, I remember seeing these other Westerners. I'd been traveling for five months with lots of other Western young hippie people, but for the first time I saw them and I felt, these are people like me. I felt a connection inside, a deeper connection on a deeper level, nothing to do with what they looked like or what they wore. It was just like, "Oh, these are people like me."

Because you don't understand anything when you first come into Sahaja Yoga. You don't understand what this is, what Mother is offering you. What I felt was, I really liked how I felt. I liked the people. I felt there's something deeper. I could feel something inside me saying, "Go back, go back." But I couldn't physically manage to attend every program. I could feel it was too much for me vibrationally. I couldn't put it into words, but I could just feel that. So I said to myself, "Just go every second night." I would have the day off just waiting for the next day to go to the program. I don't remember doing sightseeing or anything; I was just waiting.

Towards the end of the week, Douglas, bless him, said to me, "We're going to Bordi for a seminar. Would you like to come?" Oh, I forgot to say, I got to Delhi and discovered a letter from my friend saying he couldn't come. So I was completely free, no obligations. Later I thought it was a trick to get me up to Delhi, to make sure I would be there. I also discovered that I was traveling all around India during the time Mother was there. She was there from January to mid-March, and so was I. I just feel in hindsight that was no coincidence. I was in Kerala when she gave that public program, so I know that, on the one hand, we are all nothing, but Mother has shown us how each one of us is special and is taken care of.

So then I traveled on the train down to Bordi. There were very few of us, about 12 of the Western yogis. This must be the India tour, the very first India tour, with Pat, Maureen, Douglas... I think they were on one in '78 because Pat and Maureen weren't on this tour. This is the spring '79 one. No buses, no official tours. Everyone was traveling on the train. I remember feeling surprised that she didn't... I had the sense from people who talked to me about the other false gurus that they were all up in their ivory towers. If they deigned to speak with you, you were lucky. You didn't have that feeling. Shri Mataji was traveling with everyone. Her presence was very much felt, and she was the person around which everything was revolving, but she didn't trade on that in any way. We were all respected and you all had a part in her attention.

I'll skip ahead a little bit. So we're in Bordi, and I think there were about 30 people. Not all the Westerners came. And that was it, a seminar for about 30 people. I remember we had this foot soak in the ocean. At this point, I still didn't know what this was all about because Shri Mataji had only spoken in Hindi. I think the yogis might have said a few things, but I didn't have a clue. I knew you were supposed to feel something. I didn't feel anything. They'd said, "Do you feel cool?" Nada. But something inside was telling me to stick with this.

We're in this little kind of seaside hut, bigger than that, near the water. Shri Mataji's on her chair in the middle of the room, and she gets all the yogis to stand up and form this horseshoe bandhan. The person on the left had their hand towards her, and then all the rest of us were connected, actually touching. You put your hand out, and the person on one side puts their fingers into the Sahasrara. So your left hand is being connected to the person on your right, and your right hand is going into the Sahasrara of the person next to you. We're all in this lovely bandhan. And the person right at the end on the right-hand side has their hand out towards the air, away from Shri Mataji.

So we're standing like this, and then Mother says, "Are you all feeling a cool breeze in both hands?" Then I realized I'm feeling cool in my right hand for the first time. Wow, I'm feeling cool vibrations, but nothing in the left. So I said, "I'm not feeling anything in the left." And Shri Mataji said, "Come, come forward." I went up and I knelt in front of her. She seemed very big. I have this memory of her just kind of looming in front of me. She said, "Put your hands out and ask, 'Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? Is this the cool breeze of the Param Chaitanya?'"

I asked out loud, and I felt this rush. Something just rushed up, and this weight literally fell off my shoulders. It was just like coming out into the sunshine. This cool wind just blowing into me from her. And I was just like, wow. It was transformative. Suddenly I felt... obviously she just completely—my left side had been completely blocked—she just opened it up. I felt like I got my soul back again. I felt like I could write poetry. All the joy came back. My liver was very bad, so my attention couldn't settle into the silence, but I just felt totally different. I went, "Oh, wow."

Then in the afternoon, we sat around her and she spoke in English for the first time. She gave this talk, and I listened to it recently. What I remembered from that time was that in that talk, she said, "And do you think Christ was some skinny, namby-pamby sort of fellow?" And something inside me went, click. It's okay not to be thin. When I look back at that talk, so much of it is around eating and food and being balanced. I just thought, oh my gosh. Of course, there were lots of other people it must have been meant for, but it was so tailored to what I needed to hear.

But when she opened her mouth and she started to speak in English—and because I guess finally I'd really got my realization—I just felt for the first time in my life, here is somebody who is speaking and believes everything that I believe is important, that I value inside. I couldn't have put it into words or articulated it if you'd asked me, but suddenly I felt that connection. It was just so deep because we had been living in a wasteland, I would say. The times in the seventies, growing up, it was like this barren wasteland of spirituality. I'd met three people at university that I connected with on a deeper level who were also seeking, I realized later, but here was Mother in person. I felt that Mother is putting a straw down, that I've been drowning and she's putting a straw down to me. And if I hold onto this straw, everything's going to be all right.

The seminar went on. I remember at one point just bursting into tears, uncontrollably. I think your left side opens and just all the pain and the suffering that you've had stored inside you... Shri Mataji said everything we've been through is stored in our chakras, not just this life, but previous ones. All this just came out and I couldn't stop crying. Somebody told Shri Mataji and she called me and said, "No, no, no, it's okay. You have to stop crying because it doesn't make you feel good when you cry too much."

Douglas, I have to say, took care of me. He gave me a photo, a black and white photo, my first one I had for such a long time. He told me, "You can put your hands to this." And I felt a cool breeze coming out of this photo. It was just this complete package of people I could relate to, this whole change in my being. And I just knew, I just want to be here. I want to be with Shri Mataji. I need to be here.

She was winding up the tour. We went back to Mumbai. Actually, I thought we had a puja after the seminar, but when I went back and looked through the dates in Amruta, I see that the puja, Mother had a birthday puja just before we went to Bordi. And I was invited to that, can you imagine? I had that realization like five days before. We were in a much bigger room with lots of Indians, maybe 40 or 50 people there. And Mother said, "Oh," and she beckoned to me to come forward. Later, I realized she always called new people to come up and wash her feet to clear them. As I moved forward and got close, she went, "No, no, no, it's okay. Go back." I think the vibrations would have been way too much for me to handle. She was so sweet.

I basically joined the tour and stayed with them at this point. When we went down to Mumbai, I stayed with them. Mother was staying, I think, in Rajesh Shah's flat, and I was just hanging out. Then back to Delhi. We were at the train station, and I think someone must have asked me what I was going to do. Mother said to me in Bordi, "You'd better come back to London." I also remembered that was the other thing that struck me: I was very impressed by the purity and the love of the Indian Sahaja Yogis. I remember thinking, if they've got this through Sahaja Yoga, this is what I want. I want to feel like that. I want to be that kind of person.

Then Mother said to me, "You better come back to London," because at that time, there were literally only yogis in London and in Delhi and Mumbai. That was it. When I got back to London, I discovered there was Marie in France and Gregoire... I'm not sure where he was at that time, but that was it. So I arranged to stay after Mother had left, and I would cash in my boat ticket and my plane ticket, which just came to enough to get a plane ticket back to London. I had vowed I was never coming back to London again, not being a city person. And I thought to myself, if I can learn to live in London through Sahaja Yoga, then I can learn to live anywhere. You get these flashes of wisdom.

So we're standing on the station, Mother's getting the train, I guess, to the airport. Everything was very grassroots in those days. Nothing was specially organized. Everyone was completely respectful, and their behavior towards Shri Mataji, especially in India, was impeccable. But she traveled like one of us. So we're standing on the platform, and suddenly I'm thinking, Mother's going, where am I going to stay? I had seen the coordinator of Delhi, Mr. Subramanian, who was such a beautiful person, such a big heart. And in my head came this thought, "Oh, I wish I could stay with them." I felt like I would be safe, that it would be a nurturing environment. Suddenly, she turns to him and says, "She should stay with you while she's organizing to come to London." And I just went, oh. That was my first early example of how Mother can read your thoughts. She knows exactly what you're thinking. You don't have to be next to her; she has this all-encompassing attention which just... she knew everything. So that was it. I stayed with them, it was lovely, and I hopped on a plane.

On my travels, about halfway through, I was down south. I had gradually come in from the north and just moved down south: Delhi, Rajasthan, Goa, down the coast. I'm very blessed that I got to see traditional India, how every state was different. It had its own language, its own food, its own marriage customs, its own culture, its own history. Every state was like a little country.

So I'm down south, either in Karnataka... it was a little hill station up with tea plantations all around. I'm staying in a little hotel, and this young Indian manager came to me one morning and said, "We have a resident who is a palmist." Where I traveled, I hardly saw any Westerners at all. I was just trailblazing. And this Indian palmist asked the manager, "I've never read a white person's hand. I would like to. Could you ask her?" So he said to me, "Would you mind? Could he have a look at your hand?" I thought, why not?

So I'm sitting at the dining table with my hand out. He's holding my hand. He has a little book beside him that he's consulting, looking at my hand, looking at the book. No conversation is going on, and I thought, well, I should take advantage of this. I should ask him some big questions. So the hotel manager translated. I said, "Who will I marry?" And he said, "Oh, you'll marry someone from a different country," which I felt from a teenager would happen.

Then I said, "How many children will I have?" He looked at my hand and he went, "I see five children." I went, "Five?" I had always wanted to have a very loving family, and I saw having quite a few children, but I hadn't thought of five. I said, "How many boys and girls?" And he said, "I see three boys, but I can't see more."

Then I asked him, "Well, what kind of career will I have?" I have a degree in psychology. The way he described it... he didn't say accountant, lawyer, teacher, or something like that. He was the real deal because he could see bigger, more spiritual things. The way he described it, all I could relate it to was like, oh, I'm going to sort of be in some kind of organization, like in a big factory with lots of people, and I'm sort of in middle management, helping and organizing.

Anyway, I sort of forgot about all of this and just parked it away. And then, back in London, at some point, it made sense. I suddenly went, "Oh, he was talking about Sahaja Yoga. That's what this was, that I was born to be part of this."

You go back to England, and Shri Mataji starts giving these incredible talks. It was so inspirational. It was like we were on a training course. Three years later, I went to Canada, and some of the same situations I'd been through in England started to recur. I went, "Oh, my God, that was army training." Mother was taking us through so many different situations so that we would know how to deal with them in the future.

When you returned to London, which you never thought you would, what was it like at Dollis Hill?

It was very different, obviously, and it was a big culture shock at first because I'd been away seven months. To come back to this cold, grey, unfriendly city where people were far away... I tried to explain to my father how in India they were so hospitable, and even though I'd been to places where they had nothing materially, they were so much happier and more joyful than anybody I saw in London at that time.

But I remember the first day I walked into Dollis Hill. There were photos of Shri Mataji all along the hallway. It was a typical little suburban house. You walked in through the hallway, stairs going up, and then there was a double living room/dining room knocked through as one, with the kitchen at the back and three bedrooms upstairs. There were photos of Shri Mataji all down the back wall. As I walked in and saw these photos, I went, "What am I doing here with all these photos?" It was obviously my ego that just jumped up, and I just went, "Oh, be quiet. Just be quiet."

It was all so new. I'm meeting all these different people, largely Caucasian. There was Rustam, Regis was there already from Mauritius. Such a mixed bunch. Sometimes people behaved and said things in ways that I didn't feel a spiritual person should. I just remember thinking, "Why are you talking like that? How can you say that to that person? Where is your sense of compassion and heart?" But there were beautiful people there, like Maureen and Pat and Douglas. Douglas and Maureen, I really have to thank for helping and nurturing me through those early days.

At this point, after I'd been to Bordi, I got what this was. I knew this was my life. On some deep level, I just knew, I couldn't put it into words, but I knew who Mother was. She was just part of what I'd been looking for.

She would come every week. Sunday would be programs at Caxton Hall, and the talks Mother gave were incredible. You would have a question during the week, and something would come up in that talk where Mother would answer your question. All the yogis would come, most of them lived in London at that time. There would be about 40, maybe 50 people. Those early talks are so much about Christianity. I felt that these were historical talks. Mother's not just talking to us; I could feel that she's talking to change things in England and change things in the world. She's teaching us truths, breaking all the conditionings that we had in Britain, in Europe, around the world. That's why these talks can be listened to again and again, and as we go deeper personally, you hear it on a different level.

She would stand up on the stage, give her talk, and then she would get down to give the experience of realization. That could take some time and it would always involve the affirmations that we do. Then she would go down off the stage and start going from person to person. She would ask who's feeling vibrations, so she could see who could feel it, and then she would go around and start working on people one by one. She never left until every person who wanted her attention, who needed it, who stayed, got worked on. She would also direct us to other people. She'd come down off the stage, start working on one person, and then she'd say, "Felicity, go work on this person."

I discovered in those early days she would always send me to work on someone who had some kind of Christian background with a blocked Agni. I learned not to talk to them too much, not to get into arguments. What was happening as we were working on the person Mother had given us was that as we gave vibrations to their chakras, our chakras would clear. She would send us to people who had blocked chakras like ours, so it was clearing us as well as clearing them.

In the beginning, when I got back to England, I actually couldn't feel vibrations for six months. I had felt them in India, but in England, I think there was just too much Agni in the country and in myself. I had a bad Vishuddhi, a lot of guilt in my left Vishuddhi. So instead, because I didn't feel vibrations, I would just raise the person's Kundalini, and then I would just start at the bottom with my hand towards Shri Mataji and slowly give bandhans, going up their chakras. After some time, I just stopped thinking about what I was doing.

Even though I couldn't feel, Mother would say to people in the room, she would call people over to work on the person with her. She was teaching us how to work on people. She would say, "Put your hands towards them. What do you feel on your fingers?" And then she would decode. She would say, "Oh, this is because..." and she would ask people questions. Someone was catching on right heart, and she would ask that new person something, and they would always go, "Oh yes, yes." And then Mother would go, "Ha, see, now it's cleared." She showed us.

One thing I learned was that very often she would hone in on who that person was devoted to. If it was an Indian person, she would find the deity that that person's family worshipped. Then she would say, "Ah, Shri Durga... now ask, 'Is this the cool breeze? Is this the param chaitanya of Shri Durga?'" And then they would just jump up and she'd go, "Ha, see!" So she was showing us how to work on them.

She showed us very much in Dollis Hill as well, but also to some extent in Caxton Hall, if there was a bhoot or... sometimes people came who were possessed with dead spirits. In those days, it was much more common. In these days, I think it's very uncommon. We've reached a different level and we don't tend to get people coming to programs like that at all anymore. But in those days, it was much more common, and she would show how, if it moved... if you're working on someone and you're working on a catch and then it would clear, Mother would go, "Look, it's moved, look, it's moving," and then she would be just getting it out because it was some entity there. If it was just a weakness in the chakra, then you just clear it and that would be it.

So I can remember that it could be very heavy. You'd go to a program... in those days, it was a dark place to be, London. There weren't vibrations anywhere, except when you were with Shri Mataji, or in the ashram, or at the public programs. And when you meditated at home, it took a long time. That's why we learned all these different things, because it took a long time sometimes for Kundalini to come up, and you foot-soaked every day. We were very disciplined. We had lots of diets. I immediately was put on the liver diet, which was no fats. I remember making a biscuit, a cookie, that didn't have any fat in it. Good for the liver, you know. I took it and I offered one to Shri Mataji and she said, "It's a bit dry. It's good to have some fat. Your brain needs some fat in the body." It was so sweet, the way she would say things and the way she would correct you. It didn't feel like correction, most of the time.

Our whole life was focused on our chakras and trying to protect ourselves. We would go outside and Mother said, "Look at the ground, look at the grass, look at children, look at the sky. Don't look at other people," because our chakras were weak. We would just absorb everything from other people. That's why we saw so much of Shri Mataji, because she came every Sunday, most Sundays, to Dollis Hill. She would sit around in this living room and she would work on people individually. She would make us go to sleep. She'd say, "Oh, it's time for a sleep. Now you just lay down and relax." I say she would "pretend" to go to sleep because Mother never really slept; her awareness was always there. She would make us go to sleep, and she told us that she was working through the subconscious and clearing out on a much deeper level. You would feel lighter. You would feel better. You always looked forward to going because your being just felt lighter.

It's very hard to explain. People say to me, "Oh, so special, you were with Shri Mataji." I think they imagine that we were living in a world like today where there are vibrations everywhere, globally spread, you can feel your Kundalini up, deep meditation. It wasn't like that then. The reason we saw so much of Shri Mataji was that was the only way for her to work out the human beings on this level, to clear her instruments. I remember when Grzegorz came from Poland, she said, "Ah, Poland." Grzegorz was the first person who came from Poland. Our chakras reflected where we were born, the country, the culture, everything we came through. So she really did make you feel that, yes, you had personal challenges and problems, but it was also all working out on a much bigger, more global scale. You really felt part of this. She was just so incredibly inspiring. You listen to those earlier talks and she's saying, "You're my warriors, you're my instruments. We have to change the world. This is what we're doing."

We had Caxton Hall, we had Dollis Hill, and at the same time, Shri Mataji was living in Ashley Gardens in a flat in Victoria. Amazingly enough, sometimes after programs, she would invite people to come back to her flat or she would arrange a meeting. Going to her place where she lived... I remember walking in through the door and I had to use the bathroom, a little cloakroom on the side. I remember sitting in there and just feeling like I was in the womb. You're in this softness of vibrations that just permeates. You're in this bubble, like in a cloud. It's such a different experience. Thoughtless, makes you go completely thoughtless. She's living in her human form.

After Mother passed away, I realized that every moment in her presence, something was happening, something was there. These small details could be shared, not just momentous experiences.

Being in Mother's flat with her, one time there were just a few of us there. I felt, because so much had changed for me in my life—she just resurrected me—I was very grateful, eternally grateful. I got this card and I was trying to compose some message to express the gratitude that I felt. In the end, I couldn't. No words seemed sufficient. Finally I wrote, "There are no words to express what I feel in my heart." When I gave her that card, she looked at me and she said, "That's the best." So sweet.

This is moving on a little bit now. In '79, I came to London in April. During that year, a lot of founder members came in, like Malcolm, John Watkinson, the Brighton group. Then in the summer of '79, some people from TM got realization. So not only was Mother at that period, '79, '80, giving talks, she was also exposing all the false gurus who had moved into the West and were operating in London: TM, Rajneesh, the Maharishi, Scientology. We even had a fellow turn up at Dollis Hill Ashram who was a Mormon. Shri Mataji was always gracious and talked to him. After some time, he left, and Mother said, "See, it's a mesmerism. A kind of mesmerism. I couldn't get through to them."

She was doing a lot of teaching of how to handle false gurus. We actually had a sort of set piece that we used to say when we were giving programs. I would say, "Sahaja Yoga is not a cult. You don't have to have fatty food. It's not fanatical. There's not rituals and things like this. We don't take money." There were all these things that completely set Sahaja Yoga apart. And that was very important to express.

This is how false knowledge operates: it takes truth and then it twists it in its own form. Because it's coming from an evil desire to confuse and to actually destroy people's chakras, it's embedded with all these catches. When the TM people came, Shri Mataji was very clear: "If you've been studying TM, you catch on left Vishuddhi, ego, and left Swadhisthana, because you're saying mantras, it's impure knowledge, and you're paying money because you think this is how it's going to work." So that was quite an experience, absorbing and learning how to help the TMers.

Then we had this lovely group that came up from Brighton. Such a collective. They were the example of open-hearted, warm yogis. In London, there was more of a depth. I mean, Mother was there, and there was just this deeper depth that I wanted to feel. So '79 was an interesting year of people coming in and establishing themselves, and the collective growing.

We were in her flat in Ashley Gardens and there must have been about 20 of us. It seemed like most of the collective was there. She's sitting in the chair in the window bay. I remember the light coming in behind her. Suddenly the tone changed, and I felt like the weight of the vibrations changed. She just looked at us all and she said, "You are the foundations of Sahaja Yoga on which I'm building. I can't remember if she said, "I'm building on you as the foundations," but she said, "I am sending you the children, and they are the ones that are going to change the world. We will build a school that they can come to. I will raise the children in the school, and you can come and work there." It was this vision, like a temple's foundation stone. You felt that she's just filling us with so much knowledge and experience.

There were so many dramas going on that Mother engineered. After a while, I began to see she would create this situation with a yogi that then she would talk to us about. For example, we all thought everything Indian was wonderful. She matched one of the yoginis to an Indian man, and she was getting the saris and the bangles and all these nice things. Then within a few days, the whole thing was canceled. Mother talked about it and she said, "No, no, he wasn't a Sahaja Yogi. The family was this and that." And we went, "Oh, not every Indian is amazing. We don't need to have that desire to be married to Indian people."

Nearly every week, something was happening. It was such a close-knit family situation that it brought me to be very non-judgmental and compassionate, because you could see how Mother is using this yogi to expose this for us all to learn. We had a saying, "There, but for the grace of God, go I." I'm not in trouble this week, but it could be me next week. To the point that if Mother started praising someone, that person would go, "Oh, what's going to happen to me?"

It felt a bit like being in boarding school sometimes because you were so tight-knit. There were no secrets. We were just this big family. I adopted that with my children. We lived in many ashrams, and sometimes you could see really odd behavior. I would always talk to them about what was happening and say, "Well, you see, uncle has this weakness there, so that's why he's reacting like that." I would never make them feel that he was a bad person or a bad yogi.

It's really important to see the bigger picture. Mother said each one of us works out for 10,000 people. So that comforted me through a lot of challenges. Okay, this feels really personal, but I know if I can help work through this, this will help other people. Because she really emphasized "monkey see, monkey do." She told that story about the monkeys on the different islands and how one group learned to use a tool, and then the others on the other islands learned that too, without being in contact.

That is a very important point, because Mother emphasized that. The more yogis we got, the faster things would move, the more changes would happen. I could see that in Canada. When we first were there, we had seven, and then we got to 16, and you felt something vibrationally change. Then we got to 21. She said a long time ago, "When it reaches a certain big number, cancer will be eradicated."

This was the 1979 Guru Puja in December. It was held at Dollis Hill. Sometimes it wasn't so pre-planned; Shri Mataji would come and just say, "Oh, we're going to do a Guru Puja." Things were much more informal. This is such a beautiful photo. You see how youthful and young Mother looks in this picture. This was a special photo taken by the first Western yogi. Patricia told me that he took her camera to take this photo after the Guru Puja.

Patricia was just taking photos with her little camera, and when they were developed, these miracle photos came. She thought, "Oh, it's because the battery is going down or something." But Shri Mataji said, "No, this is the vibrations you can see." Shri Mataji said you could see the three channels being exposed. You can see how Mother's moving her hand, and the vibration is sort of following it. We had one yogini who had been in TM, and one time she said she saw that every time Mother lifted her hand, she could see the vibrations coming out and slaying some bhootish thing in the room. Just even this gesture that she did. Here you could actually see how the vibrations were moving and working.

After the puja, there was the signing of The Advent. This was the very first book that was written in English about Sahaja Yoga, and Shri Mataji made a really big thing about it. Gregoire was writing it. She would advise him, get him to rewrite things, reorganize the chapters. Finally it was ready, and they came with boxes of the books for the puja. They would take a new book out of the box, look around the room, and someone would be called up to be given a copy. She would open it at this page and she would write in Devanagari, which she said is the written language of Sanskrit.

The day Shri Mataji signed The Advent, I thought she was just writing her name in it like Western authors do. But when I went up to receive the book, instead, she explained what she had written. The translation of what she had written in my book said, "To my daughter Felicity, with loving blessing, your mother Nirmala."

She said to keep it in a special place like a Bible and only look at it with clean, washed hands. I have done that. Something had happened to one of the yogis, and he'd been affected by mesmerism. He came up and she said to him, "Read The Advent. That will clear your Agni."

We were also trying different ways to spread Sahaja Yoga. All we could use was newspapers with photographs, which were quite expensive. It was always important to use the photograph. Shri Mataji couldn't stress enough how it was the photograph that drew people in, gave realization, and spread vibrations. So one day I had this idea to create a little postcard and put the little black and white photo of Shri Mataji in the corner, and then write, advertising local programs. I brought it to Shri Mataji to see. She really encouraged us to come up with ideas. She would ask us, "Well, how could we do this? What do you think would work?"

I brought this postcard, and I was expecting some kind of analytical comment. She just said, "Try it." That was her attitude. "Let's try it. And if it doesn't work, we find something different." She was very spontaneous and practical. Your guiding thing was, does it have vibrations?

One day I was foot soaking and meditating in front of her picture, and I was listening to music. My attention went away from the picture, and I just sort of relaxed. I suddenly noticed I was feeling vibrations. It was really flowing. I went, "Oh, I feel vibrations." And then I looked back at the photo and it stopped. I thought, this is so weird. So I went to Shri Mataji and asked her about this because it worried me. She just sort of went quiet for a bit and then she said, "As long as you're feeling vibrations, don't worry." Later, what I think it was, was that I definitely still had bhootish things inside me. When I looked at Mother's picture, they all woke up like, "I don't like this," and everything just stopped. But when I looked away, everything relaxed and it flowed.

Basically, just don't panic. Don't worry. Be patient. The Kundalini has gone down deeper to work something deeper out. If you just be relaxed and be normal, it will come back again.

This Guru Puja was the one where Shri Mataji declared who she is. It was amazing. I felt like we'd sort of been hidden away in a pillowcase and Mother had come out and said who she was. I just remember feeling like, "Ah, she's done it! She said who she is." We all knew who she was, and we were just waiting for her to say it. You felt like this was one of those historical moments where something fundamental has changed in the world.

When she said about us being the foundation stone and she would send the children to us, she then talked about marriage. She said, "All of you must get married, and all of you must have children." She said, "If any of you don't want to get married, then get out of Sahaja Yoga. I don't want you." It was very clear that was our job, to have these children. She said there were so many souls waiting to be born. It's very different for the young people getting married today because when we got married, we all had children straight away. All our attention and our lives were focused on Sahaja Yoga, spreading Sahaja Yoga, building the collective, not on careers.

When the first children were born in England, Mother gave the name Athena, and we went, "Oh, that's nice, it's sort of Greek." And then another child was given the name Marina. And then she moved into the Sanskrit names. Now this was a big thing, because in those times, even though Britain had been in colonial India, it was not something that was respected, I think. She started giving the children these Indian names and she made it quite clear that we should use these names because they carried vibrations. Every time we said the name, it was like a mantra, and it was vibrations going out into the world. It was the beginning of embracing the beauty and the good things from the East. It was very difficult for some of us. The grandparents were like, "What is this name? How do you even say it?" They would struggle with this name.

When it came to my daughter, Richard and I, who was born in England, we said, "We're not going to give her any other name, no Western name. Just wait for Mother." We were able to take her to Chelsham Road and Shri Mataji named her Shreya, and we said, "That's it, no other name."

She also put a lot of emphasis on how we dressed, how we respected ourselves, especially in England. She said to me one time when I had recently gotten my realization, I was wearing a pair of corduroys, and she said, "It's not good to wear tight clothes." I never wore anything in Mother's presence other than a skirt or a dress. And she talked a lot about how important it was for us to wear saris at the pujas. I would say Shri Mataji was the supreme feminist in that she so supported women, women's roles, the strength of women, but as women. You don't have to detract from yourself as women. You can dress in a beautiful way.

So, 1980, Shri Mataji went to Australia, then '81 was America and Canada, which then took me into '82 when I got married.

This was my first proper tour in India in 1982. There were about 80 or 85 yogis on this tour, lots of Australians. It was for two and a half months. We arrived at the end of December, beginning of January. The tour was essentially around Maharashtra and eventually culminated in the marriages in Delhi in March. We had a program in one village, it was always in the outdoors, and people were on the rooftops, hanging out the windows. She often traveled and wore this white sari with the red border.

There was a very beautiful tour. We went to Sita's bathing place. We traveled down dusty, very hot roads. It was very physically demanding. Mother had to give a whole talk about not putting attention on your physical discomforts. Everywhere we arrived in the night, the villagers would have cooked food for us, and it didn't matter what time you arrived, you needed to eat because they had made all this huge effort. It was a real shedding of your physical conditionings. It gave the opportunity to cleanse vibrationally. Halfway through the tour, I remember just feeling like I was in that spiritual, ethereal place of India. She sent us to bathe in rivers with mud that we had to rub on ourselves.

So we traveled around all of Maharashtra and we ended up in Vaitarna. Shri Mataji had actually told me at the end of '81 to come to India on the tour. I hadn't been going to come, I didn't really have the money, but it all came together in the Sahaj way it does. Suddenly at some point I felt something change in me and I felt it's time to get married. I felt like I'd done as much growing as I could as a single person, and I felt I want someone to look after and be companionable with. So I put my name on the list.

We're in Vaitarna, and suddenly Shri Mataji says, "All those with your names on the marriage list, please stand up." So we all stood up, about 27 of us. Then we sat down, and she proceeded to talk about each person individually, even though half of them she had not met physically. If they had a weakness, she would say, "Their challenge is this and this," and then she would say something nice. She always balanced it with something good. Then she said to us, "Okay, now you go away and you write down on a list the names of three people you would like to marry." And I went, what? I didn't sign up for this.

I'd had some different experiences which I felt Mother had helped work out my conditionings of who I should marry, and I had become completely surrendered. I had decided only Mother will know who will be good for me. And then she says, put names down, and I'm going, "Oh no, I don't want to do this." But Mother said so, so you have to. I had to sit there, and there were about 12 men on the list, and I had to think about each one. And Mother had said that she matches you vibrationally. It's not for happiness, it's for your spiritual growth and joy. So how can I know?

I got to my husband, Richard, and I'd had a couple of experiences in a coffee shop, chatting with him as part of a group. I had decided he didn't understand anything. I was very into deep emotional conversations, and I could see he wasn't... I thought, "Oh, he doesn't get me at all." So I got to him and I went, "Oh, no way." And I just passed him over. Eventually, after much difficulty, I think I might have only come up with two names, and then I wrote, "I would marry anyone that Mother said."

So we're back at camp, and we've heard that Mother's in her bungalow and matching is going on. Every so often Warren, who was the leader of Australia, would arrive and come into the camp and be talking to someone. I started to get very nervous. The next time he came, I went up to him and I said, "I'd like to take my name off the list. I don't think I'm ready." He said, "Oh, actually Mother's got someone for you. She's got you a match, and it's Richard." I went, "Richard?"

But it was nice because I hadn't thought about him at all like this. It was very pure. I was still a bit concerned that this was a good match, so the next time I saw Warren, I said, "Is Mother happy with the match?" He said, "Oh yeah, she's very happy with the match." So I said, "I accept. If Mother's happy with the match, I'm happy." Later we heard that she'd said to Richard, "If Felicity doesn't accept you, I have someone else in mind for you." She really wanted him married and back to Canada. So sweet. I asked him later; he said he put my name down.

So we are engaged, and there were 12 couples. Shri Mataji said, "Two minutes. You're only allowed to talk two minutes a day, each of you. That's it." And it was 10 days to the weddings. She didn't want people to talk too much and then their egos would come up. So we weren't allowed to talk to each other, but we could be together. I was standing in the dinner queue behind him, and it was very nice because you can feel the vibrations from the person, so you start to get to know them vibrationally. I could feel he had a good heart, a kind person.

I'm standing in the queue behind him, and suddenly I feel Mother say to me, "You are two halves of a coin. You are two sides of the coin, and together you make the whole. You are coming from very different places and you are very opposite people. Over time, you will come into the center together, and then you will be balanced and have a happy life." And that's what happened. I went to Canada. We were there 35 years, and it really healed me. Later I heard Mother said, "I just had to get you out of England." It was all too heavy for your left side.

So then we had the weddings in Delhi. The grooms, they'd hired 12 horses for the grooms to come in the traditional Indian style. These were the first collective weddings in Delhi.

It was all very new. We shared one fire. Here we are standing, ready to garland. We were all given these beautiful veils Mother had bought for us, white silk with gold edging. That's me on the left-hand side in this beautiful sari.

It was a very special ceremony. There was an Indian pujari, and it felt like Shri Mataji was making up the vows on the moment. He would say something in Sanskrit, and then she would give the English vow. I remember as each one was announced, thinking, "Oh, I'd like to vow that." They were about sharing finances, welcoming Sahaja Yogis to your house. It was very groundbreaking. We just had one fire that we all walked around together.

This is after the wedding ceremony. We were taken into a place where they'd set up double bench seats for each couple to sit on, a little bit raised up. Then all the yogis came and gave us gifts. We had gifts from Pune, from Mumbai—beautiful, practical things. Each bride got a necklace and the grooms, I think, got rings. I look a bit blissed out.

Afterwards, we all got a hotel room for the night so that we could actually get to know each other. Then in the morning, we had breakfast together and then he left... no, I was due to leave very soon. So there you are, married to somebody you don't know. I remember the night of the marriage, he started sharing all these nice things about his family and friends and Vancouver.

Before we went to the hotel, I remember feeling surrounded by people congratulating us. It was the most blissful experience. You could almost physically feel the love in the air. On this India tour and after realization, Mother took us into realms of the spirit. It was such a beautiful experience. This is what's waiting for us, this realm of the spirit that is up above our Agni, beyond our thoughts, beyond what we can imagine. The deepest experiences I've had in Sahaja Yoga is when I desired to feel something. We should never stop desiring the best, the finest.

I wanted to share the story of the sari. This sari is 41 years old. It has silver thread. This was a sari that Shri Mataji chose for me. Before the weddings, we heard that someone had come from the town with saris, and they were all being laid out downstairs for the brides to choose. My instinct was drawing me towards pink, soft colors, and part of me was saying, "Oh, Felicity, this feels a little bit left-sided. Maybe you should have something different." My friend Pam picked up this multi-colored sari. She said, "Felicity, look at this sari! Isn't this wonderful? Oh, I want this sari." I said, "It's a bit loud."

Then Mother came down and she asked all the brides to bring up their choice. Pam was in front of me, and she comes up with this sari that she loves. Mother goes, "No, not this sari," takes it from Pam, puts it down, and picks up a more traditional red and green one and gives it to Pam. Then I come up with my pink one, and Mother goes, "No, no, no, not that one." Then she picks up Pam's sari, this one, and she goes, "Here, you should have this." Then she looks at me and she says, "Do you like it?" And I said, "Yes, Mother," knowing she knew exactly what I'd been feeling. Pam was a bit wistful that I got the sari that she wanted, but it was amazing because it was such a completely different sari. It was like wearing a new skin. It was perfect.

I came back from India. She said, "You fly like a bird. Get to Canada as soon as you can." Within three weeks, we had the banns for marriage published, a registry marriage in Chelsea Town Hall, we had Easter Puja at Chelsham Road, and we left. Off we went to a new life. She invited us to see her before we went. We went in, and Richard and I were squashed into her living room. There was a lot of ornate, beautiful furniture. She gestured for us to sit on the chairs. I couldn't. I felt so uncomfortable because I'm so used to sitting at Mother's feet. So I squashed myself on the floor between the chair and the coffee table, and then I felt relaxed. She talked to us about going to Canada and establishing Sahaja Yoga there. She said, "Canada is more like England than America. Go and be dynamic."

For those who feel they missed out, that they weren't with Shri Mataji physically, you mustn't feel like that. Yes, of course it was different, but I would like now to be with Mother in her physical presence as I am now. In those days, we couldn't experience and feel the immensity of her being in the same way that we can now. Now we have so much personal attention on us if we just ask for it and open ourselves. I just talk to Shri Mataji.

When Mother passed away, I was so upset because I was expecting that I would know beforehand. I came home from work and my husband and son said, "Mother's passed away." I didn't believe it. I went upstairs in front of my altar and I burst into tears and I just said, "I'm so angry with you, Mother, that you've gone." And I felt her say to me, "I had to leave so that you would become ready. You have to let my physical form go."

The best advice I would give is just meditate. Any problems you have... that's what she said to me once. She said, "How are you?" I said, "Oh, such-and-such." She said, "Meditate more." We all face challenges, and they make us grow. When we face a challenge, ask for Mother's help. Many years ago in Canada, Mother said to me, "Despite all your problems, Felicity, you have always been sincere and honest." I felt the way Mother said that, these were qualities that she felt were really important because you have to be honest with yourself. I've really come to understand that you cannot change the behavior of other people, but we can change our own behavior, how we react to things.

I would repeat what she says: "Enjoy yourself." Because when you enjoy yourself, you are relaxed, the vibrations flow, Mother can work through you, and she can fix anything. But we have to be patient with ourselves.

I think we're in a really special time, and I'm so blessed to be with all these wonderful yogis we have. It gives me so much joy to see the first, second, third generation. When I had my first grandchild, I just felt, "Wow, this is it, Mother. You've done it." She does it all. Hang on for the ride. We're on for more good times ahead.

I hope some of this will be useful and meaningful. Just from my heart to you and anyone who is watching, know that you are loved. That's what Mother said to me one time: "Can you not feel how much I love you?" She loves each one of us like that.

Thank you ever so much. We'll meet again soon.
