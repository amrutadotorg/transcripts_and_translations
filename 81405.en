Ashram in Le Raincy, Le Raincy (France)
Talk Language: English | Transcript (English) - In Progress

[Sound starts at 2:54]

Shri Mataji: You see, what is there to you ask permission for?
Gregoire: Marie has telephoned him, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Ask her.
Sahaja Yogini: Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: You tell him to come along, all right? Where is he staying? Just find out. Who is looking after that, John? See that Christophe should be told that he should come here, as soon as possible.
Gregoire to John: Ask Marie what she said, I don’t know.
Shri Mataji: There is nothing to you ask permission for.
Gregoire: Marie has telephoned him, Mother.

[Shri Mataji works on the back of a seeker]

Yes. Ann, did you tell John?
Sahaja Yogi: As far as she knows, Paul []unclear.

Shri Mataji: What about Harry? Has he come also?

Shri Mataji: [To seekers] So, you also didn’t feel, isn’t it? And he did feel something.
Gregoire: [In French: Madame, vous n’avez pas senti] Madame, you did not feel it.
Shri Mataji: Now, what do you do for the esoteric section?
Gregoire: They meet in a group and then it’s intellectual study and also they try to visualize colours, collectively.
Shri Mataji: This is the problem, you see. You see, when you are outside this house, you can see this house. That is you have to be on the sympathetic nervous system. To see the truth [unclear] But when you are inside, you don’t see. Say, from the distance, you can see a mountain, but if you are on top of the mountain, you don’t see it. So, to see it is going away from it. Because I can see you, and you can see me, all right? But I can’t see myself and you can’t see yourself.
So, it is very logical to understand that seeing is not being. All right? So, this is the wrong procedure altogether. And it is a mental projection also. It spoils your central system. But it can be cured.

Shri Mataji: They understand French?
You understand French and English too.

What’s the matter with the child, you said?
Seeker: Well, I don’t know. Physically, he seems okay, but he seems to have some trouble.
Shri Mataji: Can you call him?
Seeker: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Without the child, if she could come or she has got the child.
Please come. Please sit down.
What’s the matter with your child?
Gregoire: He is backward. His development is not...
Shri Mataji: Mental development.
Gregoire: Everything.
[8:17 No sound to 9:12]
Gregoire: ... [he is depressed] little bit from time to time.
Shri Mataji: For what? Her husband is not happy?
Gregoire: She is a little nervous.
Shri Mataji: From the very beginning.
Shri Mataji: Is it a [unclear]? You are nervous about him.
Gregoire: Generally she is.
Shri Mataji: Generally she is.
Shri Mataji: She is from where? She is from France?
Gregoire: No, Algeria.
Shri Mataji: That’s same thing.
Algeria.
Gregoire: It’s Africa, Mother.
10:00
Shri Mataji: You see, Djamel got this attack when he was eight years old.
So, what does the child do, in Algeria?
Seeker: He is here.
Shri Mataji: I see.
[To the seeker] Is he all right? Are you feeling any cool breeze, doctor?
Seeker: In the hands.
Shri Mataji: You are feeling.
Seeker: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Now, as a doctor, you don’t know that you have a liver problem.
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji: Swadisthan. Nabhi. Is he all right?
Gregoire: He doesn’t drink alcohol.
Shri Mataji: No, no, no. He thinks too much.

[Cut in the video]

[At 11:53 In the kitchen]

Alexandre: Oh, Valeria, how are you doing?
Shri Mataji: You see, because, why I am saying, the whole thing come as a moving thing. So you can’t move about. Somehow, you can move about, one can do things, you see, in the kitchen.
I keep my face all the time there.
[Laughter]
And then it could look all natural!
Alexandre: No, no, Mother. Do it naturally.
Shri Mataji: Yes, some salt.
Shri Mataji: Too much water, I think.
Not in this pot.
Because I just maintained all the chicken already. Put it in this one. Is it sour enough? Just see if it is sour enough. You know what is the word 'sour'?

Salt is all right?
Sahaja Yogini: Yes, I think. But I need less salt.
Shri Mataji: That’s very good.
That’s all. They can have more if they want [in a salt shaker].
Sahaja Yogini: Yes.

Shri Mataji: The chicken is very much cooked, also.

Shri Mataji: Hum?
Maie-Laure: We can take maybe some water?
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, it’s all right. Now you see, with the rice, you can melt it. You put the rice, and on top of that, you spread it. Because you can’t cook it anymore. Otherwise, all the chicken will become more f[unclear].
Alexandre: Very good lecture, Mother. [Laughter]
Shri Mataji: You must know exactly how much to cook. That’s the point. You can put the bread and all – what’s that?
Sahaja Yogini: [Unclear] Mother.
Shri Mataji: Give an additional taste.

It’s done. I think it’s ready then. Because the chicken will go more, sort of soft, you see, and sour.

Sahaja Yogini apart, to a man: Can you ask the men to carry the rice?

Shri Mataji: We ‘ll add this one later on for the chicken.

So that’s how I cook, all right? For my children. It’s no question of a guru; I’m your Mother. And a mother must cook for the children, isn’t it? So the food is ready now. If the rice is ready, and if the plates are there, bring the rice and just fill the plates and give it to them. And I’ll also have a plate with the rice, don’t worry. I’ll eat the same thing.
Ah, that’s over. It’s all right, I’ll put more. I think it’s a good taste. It’s all right. Thank you.
Alexandre: Thank you, Mother.

Now what should we do? Should we sit down, all of us Ann now, what you do, you get the plates and the tables, all right?
Marie-Laure; We fill it and then?
Shri Mataji: Fill it up and put this one curry and little chicken, and pass it over to all of them. But no salad or anything for them now today. Just put some bread also. I hope it will be sufficient.
[15:48 Cut in the video]

[Shri Mataji is eating on the sofa]
Shri Mataji: And little less, you can put. You put double. Water double, rice one. Then put some butter in the boiling water. When the water is boiling, before that, you wash the rice and keep it in tap water, keep it in tap water and keep it in the same.
To someone: Get something to eat and then you can speak to Me.
Hello! All right.
Then pour, take out the rice from the water, with your hands, and put it immediately into the boiling water. And then, stir that. When the water is boiling, then only put the rice, but don’t allow the water to boil too much, otherwise, the water will go away.
Then stir that. You can get rice like that, with a little salt in it. Put the salt if you want to, and again stir it. And after some more time, you just put down the heat. And you get rice like that.
Alexandre: Look well.
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji: You know, I have not done the rice. They have done it, I told them, out of instructions.
Sahaja Yogi: Oh, delicious!
Shri Mataji: I will only believe it if you eat four.
[Laughter]

Gregoire: I always remember Mother, my old fire was blown, my fire wasn't working. The kitchen was in a mess. You said, "It doesn’t matter". You took everything, the ingredients, and went near the fireplace. And on the fire of the fireplace, you cooked something which turned out to be absolutely amazing.
Shri Mataji: That’s the best way. You have the best taste with the natural wood.
Very important what [unclear].

[Cut in the video]
Shri Mataji:...Because my husband was saying that the Algerians are very good cooks.

Now, Djamila is feeling better, is it? I will tell you how to help your child.

[Cut in the video]
[Shri Mataji is giving water to a baby]
Shri Mataji: It’s all right.
He is drinking water. Mixt it up with something.
The mother: Yes. He had milk half an hour ago.
Shri Mataji: But water, you mixt something with that.
The mother: I make tea for him.
Shri Mataji: No, no, no.
The mother: Not black tea, chamomile.
Shri Mataji: That’s more [unclear]. Give them water. You must boil water and give him. I don’t know what to do, that’s not [unclear] a glass. Oh, God. If you allow Me, I’ll give him, all right.
Now all children who are born Realised drink a lot of water. And also, they may be fond of it.
To the baby: Drinking like big children! How can you? You have to suck in. You can’t have it because it’s full. Now, that’s all. [Unclear].

He wants the water to [unclear]. He enjoys. I think now, listen, it’s imaginary. I give. He is having. [Shri Mataji is using a spoon to give water to a baby] All right? Now lie down. Machindranath. Now not any more.

To Ophelia: See now! Where were you? Where did you go? Olympia? It’s just a little baby. I’m giving him water to drink, little baby. Little baby. That’s all, too much you are thinking. Very thirsty. He likes it more than milk?
Mother: Maybe. Because now with milk, he has a little difficulty digesting it.
Shri Mataji: And he got milk.
The mother: Yes.
Shri Mataji to Olympia: Now, he wants to play with you. Come along. Come here. It’s all right. Now. Oh, just loving you. All right, now, you want to take him? See this.
[Shri Mataji gives a photo to Olympia]

Gregoire: Could someone bring a glass of water to Mother after all this?
Shri Mataji: After all.

To the baby: Now very happy. Now very happy.
To Olympia: What’s that? That’s Mataji. Where is Mataji? Olympia? Where is Mataji?
To the baby: Eating the flowers!
Now he’ll eat my photograph.

And what is this one? It’s a baby. Say, “Baby.”
Olympia: Apple, apple.
Shri Mataji: Apple is not here. You have to cut it. Ask mother to cut it.
Gregoire: Now he is trying to throw flowers on you, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Apple. Please cut the apple for her.
All right, you seat here, they’ll bring for you. Sit down.
He really wants water. Yes give him a bottle of water.
Sahaja Yogini: With sugar?
Shri Mataji: No, no, without sugar. Is it boiled?
Sahaja Yogini: I have to see in the kitchen.
Shri Mataji: Take him with you. He is thirsty, what can you do?

Shri Mataji to a seeker: Feeling nice? The stomach, yes. The stomach, that is the centre for [unclear]. And if you have eaten all right, then you feel good.
Vibrations have improved? Yes.

When you stir it, you see, you should do it also clockwise. So it pours vibrations in your food when you are stirring.

Is there anybody from TM among you now? Yes. He has to [unclear] properly.

Seeker: What do you think about homeopathy?
Shri Mataji: Homeopathy is all right. Homeopathy is all right. But you see, after Realization, you don’t need any medicines. You seldom need any medicines.
Seeker: But to work as a doctor, is it?
Shri Mataji: Homeopathy is all right. As a doctor.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, he is a doctor.
Shri Mataji: To work as any doctor is all right. Nothing wrong.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, would you like some singing?
Shri Mataji: Yes. Now only. You can sit on the chair. It’s a good idea.

He knows the harmonium.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes
Gregoire: He is our great bhajan singer, Mother. He is a great specialist.
Shri Mataji: Where did you get the harmonium?
Alexandre: We brought it from India, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Oh! There must be one also in the ashram.
Alexandre: Yes, but I tried with your permission, to see, because some notes were missing. And I tried to-
Shri Mataji: Repair.
Alexandre: To put it right. But still, it needs some more keys.
Shri Mataji: No, but [unclear].
Gregoire: Anvers?
Shri Mataji: Germany.
Alexandre: Germany is the best?
[Shri Mataji nods]

[The harmonium is playing the Marathi bhajan "Amhi bighadalo"]

Shri Mataji: This is a song written by a poet, Tukarama.
[Unclear]
This was a poet, Tukarama, who wrote a lot of poems. It’s a- what you call, a pun on the word. And he says that, "Amhi bighadalo Tumhi bighadana". He says, "I am spoilt" ‘bighadane’ in Marathi means ‘spoilt’. And also, it means, ‘bi’ means a seed, the seed has taken its form, you see. ‘Ghadana ‘, my seed has taken its form. But to a mundane thing, it is, ‘bighadalo’, means ‘we are spoilt, so you also get spoilt’ you see. But the deeper meaning is that, "My seed has taken the form, so let your seed be it too". And then, I think they have made it like this that, 'in the company of Mother, we got spoilt, so you also get spoilt" you see. It is ‘spoilt’ [unclear] on the word ‘bighadalo’.

[Bhajan begins]
Amhi Bi Ghadalo Tumhi Bi Ghadana (x4, Chorus)
Matajinchya Sange Mule Bi Ghadali (x2)
Mule Bi Ghadali Chaitanyata Nhali (x2)
Sahaja Yoga Sange Badha raga Bi Ghadali (x2)
Badha Bi Ghadali Prakashamaya Zhali (x2)
Sahaja Yoga Sange Raga Bi Ghadala (x2)
Raga Bi Ghadala Anuraga Zhala (x2)
Matajinchya Sange Mihi Bi Ghadalo (x2)
Mihi Bi Ghadalo Mahayogi Zhalo (x2)
Matajinchya Sange Dharma Bi Ghadala (x2)
Dharma Bi Ghadala Vishwa Dharma Zhala (x2)
Matajinchya Sange Jana Bi Ghadale (x2)
Jana Bi Ghadale Nirmalachi Zhale (x2)

Shri Mataji: Beautiful. I must say congratulations to all of you. This is a poem written by him about, I think, two hundred years back. But it has been little bit changed by another Sahaja Yogi, whose name is Amrita [unsure] Damle. And he is a very great Sahaja Yogi. I will just again read it and give you the meaning. It’s a very touching thing. Actually, [unclear].
Gregoire: We have a translation in French, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Translation is in French?
Alexandre: We have made a translation but your translation is much better.
Shri Mataji: No, no, it’s all right.
Gregoire: Should we wash your glasses, Mother?
Shri Mataji [about her spectacles]: It’s something that’s broken. That’s gone wrong forever. Something’s gone wrong. All right, doesn’t matter.

‘Amhi Bi Ghadalo Tumhi Bi Ghadana’ means ‘we have got spoilt and you get spoilt’. Now whenever you say ‘bighadane’, it has a double meaning as I said, that the seed has taken its form, you see, there’s a transformation inside. The creation of the seed has taken place.
‘Matajinchya Sange Mule Bi Ghadali’ means in the company of our Mother, the children are being sprouted. That means the formation, I mean the creation has taken place in the seed. All right. ‘Mule Bi Ghadali Chaitanyata Nhali’. ‘Chaitanyata Nhali’, beautiful! Means the children have-are spoilt, so that they got drenched, you see, as little babies. Chaitanya, it means [unclear] vibrations you can say, or divine vibrations. So this ‘Amhi Bi Ghadalo Tumhi Bi Ghadana’
Now ‘Matajinchya Sange Badha raga Bi Ghadali’. ‘Badha’ is the impediment, impediment.

Now ‘Badha Bi Ghadali Prakashamaya Zhali’, and the obstruction got spoilt, that it became full of light. [Obstacle] itself got created and turned into light.
‘Sahaja Yoga Sange Raga Bi Ghadala’. Raga. ‘Raga’ has a double meaning too. Raga means melody. Also, raga means affection for a personality, others, love.
And it got transformed into ‘Raga Bi Ghadala Anuraga Zhala’. He's more fond of the one. ‘Anuraga’ means love. ‘Anuraga’ is love for all, total love. So this ‘raga’ got spoilt and became that ‘anuraga’.

‘Matajinchya Sange Mihi Bi Ghadalo’. ‘Mihi Bi Ghadalo Mahayogi Zhalo’.
‘In the company of Mother, I also got spoilt. And by getting spoilt, I’ve become a Mahayogi, a great yogi.’
‘Matajinchya Sange Dharma Bi Ghadala’. ‘My religion has got into creation, it’s spoilt again. My religion got spoilt. My religion got into creation and became- how do you say for that? Is manifested into creation.
And then, ‘Dharma Bi Ghadala Vishwa Dharma Zhala’. My dharma got spoilt. It became the Vishwa dharma. The religion of the universe.
‘Matajinchya Sange Jana Bi Ghadale’. The people got spoilt with Mother.
‘Jana Bi Ghadale’. The people got spoilt and they became nirmal. They became nirmal. They became Nirmala itself.
[Shri Mataji is gently laughing]
To someone: What a nice time you have come! May God bless you. They are singing. Hum.

The second one also, I’d better translate before?
Alexandre: We [unclear], Mother.

Shri Mataji: ‘Amhi Matajinchya charana [unclear]’. ‘You all have come to the Lotus Feet of Mother.’
‘Ganeshashe nameh [unclear]’. Ganesha [unclear] Sahaja Yogi zhalo.’ ‘As soon as I took the name of Ganesha, then I became Sahaja Yogi.’
Then ‘Lakshmi, Lakshmi, mhanata mhanata’. Saying ‘Lakhmi, Lakshmi’ I became Sahaja Yogi. It’s all the chakras.
‘Sarasvati pujita, pujita’, meaning ‘worshiping Sarasvati, I became a Sahaja Yogi’.
By saying, ‘Aham Brahma ashmi’ again and again, I became Sahaja Yogi.
Then by saying ‘Datta’ again, Dattatreya is the primordial master. I became Sahaja Yogi.
Then ‘Namah Shivahe, namah Shiva mhanata mhanata Sahaja Yogi zhalo’. Again I became.

‘Ram, Ram mhanata mhanata Sahaja Yogi zhalo’.
‘Krishna, Krishna mhanata mhanata Sahaja Yogi zhalo’.
‘Vitthala, Vitthala mhanata mhanata Sahaja Yogi zhalo’.
‘Yeshu Christ prabhita, prabhita Sahaja Yogi zhalo’. ‘By praying to Jesus Christ, I became Sahaja Yogi’.
‘Kundalini jagruti amruta, Chaitanya zhalo’. ‘And as soon as my Kundalini got awakened, I got my bath into Chaitanya’. It’s the Divine.

[About Olympia] She got surprised at Me.

All right, come along. What about your food? You had your food?
Sahaja Yogi: Not yet , Mother.
Shri Mataji: Not yet. All right. So, let them have something. There is something left-over.
Sahaja Yogini: They finished.
Shri Mataji: We’ve got some cheese and bread and please, look after them. You are the host here.
I think Nathalie you sit, because you sing really well. Come along. But others can go and look after. I think if you have got the meaning I need not-

[Second bhajan is sung]

Shri Mataji: Excellent. May God bless you. Even if you did, so it’s all right.

[Jai Jagadambe bhajan is sung]

Very nice.

[Hari Bol bhajan is sung]

About the baby: Yes, he is happy.
Which is the second one?
Alexandre: Jerusalem?
Shri Mataji: Then last is Jerusalem, yes, let’s have it.
Alexandre: Patricia will play. Last one, ok.
Gregoire: Mother, we just have something in French and I read it to you in English.

Be the Queen in our country, we belong to You.
Rule as a Queen in our country,
Be the Madona that one prays, kneeling, who smiles and forgives, in our country, in our place, in our heart.
You are our Mother.
Please carry to your son the humble prayer of your darling children.
Please, o pure Virgin, keep a heart which is meek, souls which are pure.
And again hearts which are strong and meek.
Shri Mataji: So beautiful.

Beautiful, very nice, very expressive. Now we can have Jerusalem. Also some Arabic songs from Guy?
[Laughter]
Gregoire: We can sing without harmonica.
[The song Jerusalem]

Sahaja Yogis: Om Twame wa sakchat, Shri Maha sakchat, Shri Adi Shakti sakchat, Shri Bhagavati sakchat, Shri Mataji, Shri Nirmala Devi namo namaha
Om Twame wa sakchat, Shri Kalki sakchat, Shri Sahasrara swamini moksha Pradahini Mataji, Shri Nirmala Devi namo namaha.
Om Twame wa sakchat, Shri Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati, Mahakali, trigunat mika Kundalini sakchat, Shri Adi Shakti sakchat, Shri Bhagavati sakchat, Shri Mataji, Shri Nirmala Devi namo namaha

Shri Mataji: Good. Everyone's feeling?

May God bless you all.
I hope to see you again this evening. And I must say, such a dream of the Divine, I feel now coming to its fulfilment. And people coming from all over the world, in one universal religion, integrating all their religions without losing the beauty of every, are singing one wit, with one melodious tone, the praise of God Almighty.

And these days, the Divine has to integrate all that is beautiful and holy together, and shake off everything that is ugly and anti-God. And I now see the beginning of that Golden Age which is the dream of your Father, God Almighty. It’s a very great joy for Me. I hope you will invest all the new people with gentleness, understanding and love. And give them whatever you have received in Sahaja Yoga with an open heart, and make them grow with enrichment of knowledge, thus giving blissful existence. As you are enjoying the bliss of God, share it with the new people. They may not be yet up to that level, doesn’t matter. Some of them may argue or doubt, but don’t get angry with them. You were also like that. So be extremely kind and absolutely compassionate. As I have loved you, you have to love all of them, and not a single soul who has got Realisation be lost. May God bless you.

May God bless you.
Thank you very much for the nice lunch.

[To a new lady]: Are you all right now? Put your left towards the right, all right? Left here. [Unclear] First left, then right. She should start with the Left Heart.
She should also say that she is the Spirit.

All right, for all the new people, thank you very much. I hope today you’ll all come, and learn how to give Realization. All right?
Who are all the new people, just come forward. I’ll shake hands with them.

[Shri Mataji shake hands with the new people]
May God bless you.
May God bless you.

Seeker: I’m very glad to see you.
Shri Mataji: I’m very glad also. I’m glad to meet all of you. Elise is there.
How are you?

May God bless you.
Good. Those who are hot should place their right hand, left hand on the liver, and right hand towards the photograph.
Gregoire: I explained them already.
Shri Mataji: Again, because some of them are new. I met all of them now?
Alexandre: Yes, dear Mother.

Shri Mataji: Yes? Thank you.
Elise is there.
How are you?
And some of you have got Vishuddhi, I think. For that, the mantra is, "Allah hu Akbar" which you should tell them. Because if your face is reddened, then know that you have got a Vishuddhi problem.

[Gregoire explains how to do it.
Sahaja Yogis and seekers say 16 times "Allah hu Akbar"]

Alexandre in French: You’re always welcome here. And so, tonight we have another program. It’s going to be the last night we’ll be able to see Mother. So we’ll see you tonight.
