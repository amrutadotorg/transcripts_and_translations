Talk Language: English | Transcript (English) - In Progress

[Sound starts at 2:54]

Shri Mataji: You see, what is there to you ask permission for?
Gregoire: Marie has telephoned him, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Ask her.
Sahaja Yogini: Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: You tell him to come along, all right? Where is he staying? Just find out. Who is looking after that, John? See that Christophe should be told that he should come here, as soon as possible.
Gregoire to John: Ask Marie what she said, I don’t know.
Shri Mataji: There is nothing to you ask permission for.
Gregoire: Marie has telephoned him, Mother.

[Shri Mataji works on the back of a seeker]

Yes. Ann, did you tell John?
Sahaja Yogi: As far as she knows, Paul []unclear.

Shri Mataji: What about Harry? Has he come also?

Shri Mataji: [To seekers] So, you also didn’t feel, isn’t it? And he did feel something.
Gregoire: [In French: Madame, vous n’avez pas senti] Madame, you did not feel it.
Shri Mataji: Now, what do you do for the esoteric section?
Gregoire: They meet in a group and then it’s intellectual study and also they try to visualize colours, collectively.
Shri Mataji: This is the problem, you see. You see, when you are outside this house, you can see this house. That is you have to be on the sympathetic nervous system. To see the truth [unclear] But when you are inside, you don’t see. Say, from a distance, you can see a mountain, but if you are on top of the mountain, you don’t see it. So, to see it is going away from it. Because I can see you, and you can see me, all right? But I can’t see myself and you can’t see yourself.
So, it is very logical to understand that seeing is not being. All right? So, this is the wrong procedure altogether. And it is a mental projection also. It spoils your central system. But it can be cured.

Shri Mataji: They understand French?
You understand French and English too.

What’s the matter with the child, you said?
Seeker: Well, I don’t know. Physically, he seems okay, but he seems to have some trouble.
Shri Mataji: Can you call him?
Seeker: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Without the child, if she could come or she has got the child.
Please come. Please sit down.
What’s the matter with your child?
Gregoire: He is backward. His development is not...
Shri Mataji: Mental development.
Gregoire: Everything.
[8:17 No sound to 9:12]
Gregoire: ... [he is depressed] little bit from time to time.
Shri Mataji: For what? Her husband is not happy?
Gregoire: She is a little nervous.
Shri Mataji: From the very beginning.
Shri Mataji: Is it a [unclear]? You are nervous about him.
Gregoire: Generally she is.
Shri Mataji: Generally she is.
Shri Mataji: She is from where? She is from France?
Gregoire: No, Algeria.
Shri Mataji: That’s same thing.
Algeria.
Gregoire: It’s Africa, Mother.
10:00
Shri Mataji: You see, Djamel got this attack when he was eight years old.
So, what does the child do, in Algeria?
Seeker: He is here.
Shri Mataji: I see.
[To the seeker] Is he all right? Are you feeling any cool breeze, doctor?
Seeker: In the hands.
Shri Mataji: You are feeling.
Seeker: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Now, as a doctor, you don’t know that you have a liver problem.
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji: Swadisthan. Nabhi. Is he all right?
Gregoire: He doesn’t drink alcohol.
Shri Mataji: No, no, no. He thinks too much.

[At 11:53 In the kitchen]

Shri Mataji: You see, because, why I am saying, the whole thing come as a moving thing. So you can move about. There is no harm in moving about. [Unclear] you see, in the kitchen. Shall I keep my feet all the time there?
[Laughter]
And then I could look at my children.
Shri Mataji: Too much water, I think. ...Not in this pot. Because that just maintains all the chicken also. Put it in this one. Is it sour enough? Just see if it is sour enough. Salt is all right? A little more. They can have more if they want [in a salt shaker].

The chicken is very much cooked.

Sahaja Yogini: Do you think we need some water?
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, it’s all right. Now you see, with the rice, it gets wet. You put the rice and on top of that, you spread it. Because you can’t cook it anymore, otherwise all the chicken will become most [unclear].
Alexandre: Very good lecture, Mother. [Laughter]
Shri Mataji: You must know exactly how much to cook. That’s the point. You can put the bread and all – what’s that?
Sahaja Yogini: [Unclear] Mother.
Shri Mataji: It’s done. I think it’s ready then. Because the chicken will go more, sort of soft, you see, and sour.

Sahaja Yogini apart, to a man: Can you ask the men to carry the rice?

Shri Mataji: We have this one later on for the chicken.

So that’s how I cook, all right? For my children. It’s no question of a guru; I’m your Mother. And a mother must cook for the children, isn’t it? So the food is ready now. If the rice is ready, and if the plates are there, bring the rice and just fill the plates and give it to them. And I’ll also have a plate with the rice, don’t worry. I’ll eat the same thing.
Ah, that’s over. It’s all right, I’ll put more. That gives a good taste. It’s all right. Thank you.
Now what should we do? Should we sit down, all of us? Christine, what you’ll do, you’ll get the plates and the rice, fill it up, and put this one curry and little chicken and pass it over to all of them. But no salad or anything for them now today. Just put some bread also. I hope it will be sufficient.
[15:48 Cut in the video]

[Shri Mataji is eating on the sofa]
Shri Mataji: Water double, rice one. Then put some butter in the boiling water. When the water is boiling, before that, you wash the rice and keep it in water, keep it in water and keep it in the same.
To someone: Get something to eat and then you can speak to Me. All right.
Then, take out the rice from the water, with your hands, and put it immediately into the boiling water. And then, stir that. When the water is boiling, then only put the rice, but don’t allow the water to boil too much, otherwise, the water will go away.
Then stir that. You can get rice like that, with a little salt in it. Put the salt if you want to, and again stir it. And after some more time, you just put down the heat. And you get rice like that.
Alexandre: Look well.
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji: You know, I have not done the rice, they have done it, I told them, out of instructions.

Sahaja Yogi: Very good.
Shri Mataji: I will only believe it if you eat all.
[Laughter]

Gregoire: I always remember Mother, [unclear] the fires were not working. The kitchen was in a mess. You said, "It doesn’t matter". You took everything, all the ingredients, and you went near the fireplace. And on the fire of the fireplace, you cooked something which turned out to be absolutely amazing.
Shri Mataji: That’s the best way. You get the best taste in the natural wood.
Very important what you [unclear].

[Cut in the video]
Shri Mataji:...Because my husband was saying that the Algerians are very good cooks.

Now, Djamila is feeling better, is it? I will tell you how to help your child.

[Cut in the video]
[Shri Mataji is giving water to a baby]
Shri Mataji: It’s all right.
He is drinking water. Mixt it up with something.
The mother: Yes. He had milk half an hour ago.
Shri Mataji: But water, you mixt something with that.
The mother: I make tea for him.
Shri Mataji: No, no, no.
The mother: Not black tea, chamomile.
Shri Mataji: That’s more [unclear]. Give them water. You must boil water and give him. I don’t know what to do, that’s not [unclear] a glass. Oh, God. If you allow Me, I’ll give him, all right.
Now all children who are born Realised drink a lot of water. And also, they may be fond of it.
To the baby: Drinking like big children! How can you? You have to suck in. You can’t have it because it’s full. Now, that’s all. [Unclear].

He wants the water to [unclear]. He enjoys. I think now, listen, it’s imaginary. I give. He is having. [Shri Mataji is using a spoon to give water to a baby] All right? Now lie down. Machindranath. Now not any more.

To Ophelia: See now! Where were you? Where did you go? Olympia? It’s just a little baby. I’m giving him water to drink, little baby. Little baby. That’s all, too much you are thinking. Very thirsty. He likes it more than milk?
Mother: Maybe. Because now with milk, he has a little difficulty digesting it.
Shri Mataji: And he got milk.
The mother: Yes.
Shri Mataji to Olympia: Now, he wants to play with you. Come along. Come here. It’s all right. Now. Oh, just loving you. All right, now, you want to take him? See this.
[Shri Mataji gives a photo to Olympia]

Gregoire: Could someone bring a glass of water to Mother after all this?
Shri Mataji: After all.

To the baby: Now very happy. Now very happy.
To Olympia: What’s that? That’s Mataji. Where is Mataji? Olympia? Where is Mataji?
To the baby: Eating the flowers!
Now he’ll eat my photograph.

And what is this one? It’s a baby. Say, “Baby.”
Olympia: Apple, apple.
Shri Mataji: Apple is not here. You have to cut it. Ask mother to cut it.
Gregoire: Now he is trying to throw flowers on you, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Apple. Please cut the apple for her.
All right, you seat here, they’ll bring for you. Sit down.
He really wants water. Yes give him a bottle of water.
Sahaja Yogini: With sugar?
Shri Mataji: No, no, without sugar. Is it boiled?
Sahaja Yogini: I have to see in the kitchen.
Shri Mataji: Take him with you. He is thirsty, what can you do?

Shri Mataji to a seeker: Feeling nice? The stomach, yes. The stomach, that is the centre for [unclear]. And if you have eaten all right, then you feel good.
Vibrations have improved? Yes.

When you stir it, you see, you should do it also clockwise. So it pours vibrations in your food when you are stirring.

Is there anybody from TM among you now? Yes. He has to [unclear] properly.

Seeker: What do you think about homeopathy?
Shri Mataji: Homeopathy is all right. Homeopathy is all right. But you see, after Realization, you don’t need any medicines. You seldom need any medicines.
Seeker: But to work as a doctor, is it?
Shri Mataji: Homeopathy is all right. As a doctor.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, he is a doctor.
Shri Mataji: To work as any doctor is all right. Nothing wrong.

Sahaja Yogi: Mother, would you like some singing?
Shri Mataji: Yes. Now only. You can sit on the chair. It’s a good idea.

He knows the harmonium.
Sahaja Yogi: Yes
Gregoire: He is our great bhajan singer, Mother. He is a great specialist.
Shri Mataji: Where did you get the harmonium?
Alexandre: We brought it from India, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Oh! There must be one also in the ashram.
Alexandre: Yes, but I tried with your permission, to see, because some notes were missing. And I tried to-
Shri Mataji: Repair.
Alexandre: To put it right. But still, it needs some more keys.
Shri Mataji: No, but [unclear].
Gregoire: Anvers?
Shri Mataji: Germany.
Alexandre: Germany is the best?
[Shri Mataji nods]

[The harmonium is playing the Marathi bhajan "Amhi bighadalo"]

Shri Mataji: This is a song written by a poet, Tukarama.
[Unclear]
This was a poet, Tukarama, who wrote a lot of poems. It’s a- what you call, a pun on the word. And he says that, "Amhi bighadalo Tumhi bighadana". He says, "I am spoilt" ‘bighadane’ in Marathi means ‘spoilt’. And also, it means, ‘bi’ is a seed, the seed has taken its form, you see. ‘Ghadana ‘, my seed has taken its form. But to a mundane thing, it is, ‘bighadalo’, ‘we are spoilt, so you also get spoilt’ you see. But the deeper meaning is that, "My seed has taken the form, so let your seed be it too". And then, "I think they have made it like this, and with the company of Mother, we got spoilt, so you also get spoilt" you see. It is ‘spoilt’ [unclear] on the word ‘bighadalo’.

Shri Mataji: Beautiful. I must say congratulations to all of you. This is a poem written by him about, I think, two hundred years back. But it has been little bit changed by another Sahaja Yogi, whose name is Amrita [unsure] Damle. And he is a very great Sahaja Yogi. I will just again read it and give you the meaning. It’s a very touching thing. Actually, [unclear].
Gregoire: We have a translation in French, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Translation is in French?
Alexandre: We have made a translation but your translation is much better.
Shri Mataji: No, no, it’s all right.
Gregoire: We want your blessings.

Shri Mataji [about her spectacles]: It’s something that’s broken. That’s gone wrong forever. Something’s gone wrong. All right, doesn’t matter.
