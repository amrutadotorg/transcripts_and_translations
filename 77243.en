[Shri Mataji speaks at 2:07:34]

It was really another great evening for all of us. And people are so creative, I am surprised the way they brought up such a difficult subject, controversial to so many theories already established.
So, you have seen how people can really understand now Sahaja Yoga better through the media of a theatre. Because to talk like this in the public is an impossible situation. Because they would never accept such a theory of a Kundalini coming as a serpent. But with this kind of a drama, I’m sure one day it will go into their heads that they need transformation everyone.

I don’t know how to thank all of you, especially those who acted for bringing of the beauty of such a subtle and a difficult subject. I knew what was on, what they were doing it. When I saw the snake, I knew what it was. But still, I must say I never expected such a manifestation of the beautiful ideology, I should say, beautiful reality which people don’t know, are not prepared to go beyond their rational mind to understand. But if the priests tell them or if a Mullah tells them or if a Buddhist tells them, then they are willing to accept it. But if Sahaja Yogis tell them the reality, they should accept it. Because, first they’ll have the experience. Once they have the experience, then they will believe that this is the reality. And this is how things have worked out.

Perhaps, I have not written about it in my book or nowhere, because they will put Me into court, I think, if they come to know about it. But the way you have done it is really so convincing, so beautifully convincing to people, that we should take it out, wherever it is possible. Maybe I’ll try; somebody in India, might try from the television, maybe. If they have some courage, they might do it.

Now as it is, times are very vibrant and many things are happening at this time, you can notice that so many things are happening. Because they have played with the ignorance of people and cheat them and miscarried them. But you know the reality, you have had the experience, and you know what you are capable of, what you can do. I would just suggest that you are not alone like Adam and Eve. You are so many! And you won’t suffer like the saints have suffered. On the contrary, you will get a great joy in giving Realisation to others, and talking about Sahaja Yoga. That will be the most enjoyable thing for you, remarkable for you, and a way is great satisfaction for you.

You have to go around and spread the news that the time has come for you to have transformation. I’ll give you an example of what things are happening. Like in Turkey, we had a big earthquake. And there, not a single Sahaja Yogi got any, any problem: their houses were saved, their things were saved. All such Sahaja Yogis are saved.

Today, I received a letter from a girl who was travelling by this London train which met with the accident. The parents have written to Me that she had my locket, and at the time when the trains just bumped into each other, this girl, actually, was not sitting on a bench, as such. But she was looking at something. As a result, she never got that jumping, or you can say that blow. And she said that she had just driven to the door, before the fire started, and she is saved.

Many people who are under attack will be saved. There's no doubt about it. And many people who are to be destroyed will be destroyed. But it's not the human beings that will be destroyed, but the wrong concepts under which people have been tortured, troubled, imprisoned, mesmerized. All those concepts will be exposed, and that will show that really, the Satya Yuga has started.
It is a very great time you are born, that you could all get your Realization and you can enter into this eternal life of truth. It's something very fortunate on your part, and fortunate for Me also, that I met you all and that you all came along and understood Me. It's difficult to understand a person like Me, because I say controversial things, but still, you accepted it because of your experience.

So tomorrow, I'm going to tell you what is the job of a Mahakali, and you'll be amazed how you are blessed by this Mahakali Power.

As far as today is concerned, I must congratulate all of those who have made this drama so wonderful and so successful. It's something very, very well done. And also, the way you have made the stage, and everything is remarkable. You have worked very hard. I must say, the English are known for their dramas. Very good dramas they used to make. Not now, but they used to make, I would say. Because now I can't see some of the dramas you are having there. But such nice dramas you had and such a sense of acting and rendering different scenes you had. All that was your specialty. And today I see the English coming around—or should I say the British—coming around and showing such a beautiful sense of acting and sense of production of the whole theme, which is so difficult. The way it was brought in, I don't know. Anybody would congratulate you for that. As far as I am concerned, I am really amazed, how you could achieve such a difficult task. So all my love and all my blessings to you all.

I must also say for Mr. Pawar, that he came all the way because I said, "You must come." And he was in a very unhappy mood when I met him. But I am sure, one day, he'll prosper now very well. And how he worked hard to express himself in different beats, ‘talas’, different beats, in different ways. Of course, now you all have started understanding these complicated things, like our Indian rhythms. But they are very rhythmic, and they are not only rhythmic, but they are very systematic and scientific. And they all have a great meaning.
So, I am very happy that you all have enjoyed that and that dancing very much. You encouraged him. And next time, he says, he'll bring some lady who is also dancing with him. So, we'll have some other dancing also.

As it is, tomorrow's time, we have to fix for the puja. I said about two o'clock will be all right because we'll finish, I hope, by seven or eight. Because, it’s not so very cold, but it is becoming. Surprisingly, this time, it was quite sensible. The nature has been very kind. And tomorrow, if anybody wants to meet Me or see Me, can also come at about twelve o'clock. And all the leaders can also come and see Me tomorrow at twelve o'clock. I hope that suits you all.

I don't know how much to say because I'm really overwhelmed by the production of this beautiful drama, and the music of Mr. Pawar. I mean, I wish him all good luck, and I'm sure he'll show his delicate sides also, and also his creativity in a much more fragrant way. Though today he has worked very hard, I must say, I never expected it when he was in such an unhappy mood, but he's done so well.

Then also, this thing that he has trained Sahaja Yoginis. This idea came to Me. I know, I just felt that if I tell him, he'll take it up. But he took it up so well! And all the girls were dancing so beautifully. I thought the Vrindavan had come here or what? The way they danced in such a good rhythm and everything, it was very surprising, very, very surprising, how these girls who never had training in Kathak, or in Indian dancing or in Indian music did so well, understanding the importance of rhythm, and also of the- you see, I get lost with English language sometimes. But I should say, it was the theme, theme of the subject. The theme has to be expressed. But the complicated rhythm is such that, you should know how to come to the first one [beat] that is ‘sama’, as we call it. It's a very, very difficult thing. But the way you have understood the point, and the way you are doing it, I mean I can't believe it, really. Because I used to think that, when I went to London, I felt the girls were walking like horses, like that.
[Laughter]

All their hair they had, you see small hair, and they used to jump like this. So I said, "How can these girls ever understand the delicacy of rhythm?" But not the black people- are not like that. Black people I've seen, even if they are going for a funeral, they'll be dancing with the tune, you know. But in England, I was surprised because they are so fond of horses, that I think horses had a great influence in their way of life. But now I think it's gone. It's not so much. It must change, and the way the girls did the dance very, very graciously, very delicately, I must say, what a transformation! And what a beautiful drama of the whole thing.

So I must also thank our gentleman, Mr. Sukhvinder Singh. Sukhvinder means, "The one who gives joy". And he's really very joy-giving. I didn't know he could play with a Kathak dancer. I didn’t know. I had never seen him before with Mr. Pawar or anyone. But Mr. Pawar told Me that he does play. I was very happy because he's a very good player, very rare, and one day he'll become a world-famous player, no doubt.

Then the other gentleman who played on the santoor also, was very well accomplished, I must say. Though I think I've heard him before or I’ve seen him before. His face seems familiar. But he was very much synchronizing with the whole thing, and it's very surprising. I've never seen any santoor player playing with the dancers. At the most, a harmonium fellow could be there singing, but never a santoor player. And he brought all the deficiencies [nuances] of a singer in his play. It was- you never felt missing that singer or a musician behind. It was so well done! I congratulate him also with all the rest of them. And may God bless them and give them a long life to entertain the whole world.
May God bless you all.
Hope to see you tomorrow at two o'clock. I hope, two o'clock, we'll maintain the time. All right?
Tomorrow there is only brunch, so I think we can manage.
Thank you very much. Thank you all of you, thank you, thank you.
