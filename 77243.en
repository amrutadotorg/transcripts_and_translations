It was really another great evening for all of us. And people are so creative, I am surprised the way they brought up such a difficult subject, controversial to so many theories already established.
So, you have seen how people can really understand now Sahaja Yoga better through the media of a theatre. Because to talk like this in the public is an impossible situation. Because they would never accept such a theory of a Kundalini coming as a serpent. But with this kind of a drama, I’m sure one day it will go into their heads that they need transformation element.

I don’t know how to thank all of you, especially those who had Ted for bringing of the beauty of such a subtle and a difficult subject. I knew what was on, what they were doing it. When I saw the snake, I knew what it was. But still, I must say I never expected such a manifestation of the beautiful ideology, I should say, beautiful reality which people don’t know, are not prepared to go beyond their rational mind to understand. But if the priests tell them or if a Mullah tells them or if a Buddhist tells them, then they are willing to accept it. But if Sahaja Yogis tell them the reality, they should accept it. Because, first they’ll have the experience. Once they have the experience, then they will believe that this is the reality. And this is how things have worked out.

Perhaps, I have not written about it in my book or nowhere, because they will put Me into court, I think, if they come to know about it. But the way you have done it is really so convincing, so beautifully convincing to people, that we should take it out, wherever it is possible. May I’ll try somebody in India, might try from the television, maybe, if they have some courage, they might do it.

Now as it is, times are very vibrant and many things are happening at this time, you can notice that so many things are happening. Because they have played with the ignorance of people and cheat them and miscarried them. But you know the reality, you have had the experience, and you know what you are capable of, what you can do. I would just suggest that you are not alone like Adam and Eve. You are so many! And you won’t suffer like the saints have suffered. On the contrary, you will get a great joy in giving Realisation to others, and talking about Sahaja Yoga. That will be the most enjoyable thing for you, remarkable for you, and a way is great satisfaction for you.

You have to go around and spread the news that the time has come for you to have transformation.
