 (England)
In 2020, I was asked to give an interview on how I came to Sahaja Yoga for the documentary Storie di evoluzione al femminile (Stories of Women's Evolution), filmed in Italian with English subtitles. The film is about women who, by seeking and nurturing their inner being, have overcome their own fears and can now face life with greater courage and self-esteem. This interview you will see is part one of my memories, which were not exactly golden at the time. It's called "Elizabeth's Story" in the film.

Part two, which I have entitled "A Sahaj Pilgrim's Progress: Protection, Tapasya, Miracles and Blessings," describes the way in which I was guided, protected, comforted, and cured by the divine power that time after time prevented me from going in the wrong direction before taking me by the hand and bringing me to Sahaja Yoga. Indeed, even the darkest clouds have a silver lining, thanks to our beloved Mother, who is always guiding, protecting, and looking after us, her children.

My name is Elizabeth Matthews. I was born and raised in England. After graduating from university in England, I married a Frenchman and moved to France. He was a depressive maniac, which in fact corresponds much more to what he had. Because every winter, starting in autumn, he would become depressed. He went down and down until he attempted suicide. Then, in the summer, it was the opposite. In the spring, he started to be what I called normal—a very sensitive, very polite person, a normal, intelligent person. He was also a teacher, like me, and everything seemed fine. Then, as summer went on, he became hyperactive, aggressive, arrogant, and sometimes violent. So, in the summer, I had no choice. I had to suffer his anger, and that was it.

The first thing was that, alone in France, I had neither family nor friends. I had only been there for a few months, and I was pregnant. I was just alone. After three years of this series of depression and hyperactivity, I told him that I couldn't take it anymore, that I wanted to leave and take my children to England, because by then I had two.

He got very angry and threatened to kill all three of us before I could leave. What could I do? I was alone, and he was also a hunter. He had a rifle, and from that moment on, he always kept a rifle under his bed. Always. I was really scared. In addition to the loneliness, I couldn't talk to anyone about it.

He said that I couldn't leave. I couldn't do anything. I had already earned a French degree, and I had told myself that by getting a British degree, I could teach and be a little more independent. But I had to stop studying.

In 1979, they introduced divorce in France. I went to find a lawyer who said to me, "Why didn't you leave before?" I looked at him and said, "If I told you, you wouldn't believe it. But I couldn't." I stayed like this for ten years because it was necessary. "But now I want a divorce," I told him. I chose to see the lawyer when my husband was depressed, thinking that at that moment there would be no violence. By the time he came out of his treatment, we were already almost divorced.

In 1980, after the divorce, I took my children away and we moved to Geneva, where I was given a teaching position in a French international high school on the border with Geneva, Switzerland. For ten years, I raised my children on my own. But a year after I moved to Geneva, my ex-husband committed suicide. This caused many, many psychological problems for my children. My daughter was 13 years old and had become very rebellious. There was nothing to do with her; I couldn't say or do anything for her. My son, on the other hand, who was one year younger, locked himself up. He no longer worked at school and no longer spoke.

I started working a lot. I did all the activities that I had done in England when I was young: I did theater, I played tennis at a fairly high level, and in the summer, I went to the mountains—the Jura and the Alps around Geneva. In the winter, I skied. I had so many activities that I didn't have time to think about my problems, but it became a little too much.

One day, I was walking in the Jura mountains with a colleague, and he said to me, "You know what? I found a meditation yoga that I started, and it seems to me that it would interest you too." Like her, I was very interested in Buddhism and inner peace. She gave me the book by Grégoire de Kalbermatten, a Swiss diplomat who had been with Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi in London in the '70s, where he introduces and talks about Sahaja Yoga. That's what this yoga was called. I read this book, which is called L'Avvento, and I immediately understood that it was for me. I asked my colleague to let me meet the Swiss group in Geneva who practiced this yoga.

I had to wait a few months because it was summer and there was no one around. But in the end, she invited me to her home with another lady and four or five yogis, practitioners of Sahaja Yoga in Geneva. There they raised our Kundalini and gave us our Self-Realization.

After the experience, a yogi asked, "Do you have any questions?" The other lady said, "Yes," and started asking many questions. Then they turned to me, and I said I didn't have any. I had nothing really in mind. I was completely without thoughts because I had found this inner peace that I had been looking for for so many years. There was nothing to say. I felt so good. I no longer felt the need to do all the activities I did before—to run to the right and to the left. Inside me, there was everything. There was silence, peace. I had really found what I needed.

From that moment on, I started to read everything I found: the discourses of Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi. Reading all these discourses, I understood the importance of the woman, of all women, and of the family. I started to do a little introspection about myself. If I had let myself be taken into that first phase of submission and depression, it was because I had no respect for myself. I didn't realize the importance of the role that the woman has in the family, in society, in the world.

The way that I chose to get out of that phase was through hyperactivity—doing all these sports, travels, theater, and so on, to forget the things that didn't fit me. I wanted to believe that I was someone else, someone strong and powerful, but inside me, there was still this fragile side. In fact, I created an imbalance inside of me. From the depression of before, I went to stress, action, and frenetic movement. It's not this imbalance that brings us inner peace. It's not like this that we can truly be ourselves. To be ourselves, we women must be centered. In the center. Neither depressed nor hyperactive. We are the peace itself. We are like a fortress that supports the family, that supports society. I understood that it's only with Sahaja Yoga that I found the means to be myself and to be able to help others who have lived through very bad things. So I can tell you from the heart, really, that at my age of more than 70 years, after 34 years of practicing this yoga, I feel truly happy. The inner peace, the silence, is there even when there are problems, if we know how to be in balance.

At the time of my divorce in France in 1979, I had never heard of Sahaja Yoga or Shri Mataji, who at that time was in London looking after a group of hippies, a few of whom were French. Until they were fully established, Sahaja Yoga could not spread in Europe, except in Switzerland, where Grégoire de Kalbermatten brought his brother, sisters, and friends to Sahaja Yoga and formed a group who were meditating in Geneva. Quite by chance, in 1980, the French Ministry of Education appointed me to teach at the international high school on the Swiss-French border, just a 15-minute drive from the center of Geneva. I couldn't understand why I was being sent there at the time, especially as I had applied for a posting to another French international school at Valbonne, near Nice, in the south of France. Little did I know that I was being directed to Geneva because there I would get my realization.

During my summer vacation in 1982, I went to visit my brother, who was living in Hong Kong, where he was chief architect for what was still a British colony. I explored southern China before flying to Thailand and touring the whole country in a jeep with several other people of different nationalities. One of the highlights was traveling down the Mekong River in a friendly Thai villager's rice boat as far as Burma (Myanmar) to visit villages in the Golden Triangle, where they still cultivated and smoked opium.

One of my fellow travelers was a Belgian scientist whose hobby was visiting a different part of the world every summer and filming a documentary about it, which was then shown to the public at a cinema in Belgium. More than a year later, Marcel, the Belgian scientist, contacted me to say that he wanted to film a documentary in India about the different religions in Kashmir: Muslims in Srinagar, Buddhists in Ladakh, and Hindus on their annual pilgrimage to Amarnath in the Himalayas. He had understood from our conversations in Thailand that I was fascinated by India and Buddhism. Would I be interested in helping him do research for the film and then accompanying him on the trip to act as his interpreter?

The first photo was taken in Srinagar, on a houseboat on Dal Lake where we stayed. These beautiful boats were originally holiday homes for the families of British government officials when India was part of the British Empire. We visited floating markets and admired local products and handicrafts.

Then came the five-day pilgrimage up the Himalayas to the cave in Amarnath where Shri Shiva told Shri Parvati the secret of eternal life. Hindu tradition has it that this secret was overheard by a parrot, so Shri Shiva transformed the parrot into a block of ice to stop it from talking. In the cave, there is usually a large Shiva Lingam made of ice and a smaller one next to it. By the way, Sahaja Yogis prefer to think that the smaller lingam is in fact Shri Ganesha, not a parrot.

This trip was planned for August 1985, and for a whole year beforehand, I was doing research to prepare for it. I had even made an appointment with the Dalai Lama at his ashram in Switzerland for July 1984, partly for information about Tibetan Buddhism but also for my own purposes. At last, I could find out more about how to achieve inner peace. But then, a letter came from the Ministry of Education with the dates when I would have to be examining students in Lyon. I would be working full-time in July. There was absolutely no way I could get to Lausanne for my appointment. Disappointed, I set about looking for an alternative.

Eureka! We would be in Leh, the capital of Ladakh, on August 15th, Indian Independence Day. On that day every year, villagers came from all over Ladakh to welcome the Dalai Lama, who would be visiting Buddhist monks in Leh. In the afternoon, the doors of the monastery were always opened for a public audience. Hooray!

We saw the Dalai Lama's car arrive and drive along the main street to the monastery, but there was no sign of the man himself. We were there all afternoon, waiting for the monastery doors to open, but they never did. For the second time, I was unable to meet the Dalai Lama.

In autumn 1985, the English Dramatic Society in Geneva was putting on the play Old Times by Harold Pinter, and I was playing one of the three characters. Our play was then chosen to represent Switzerland at an international English drama festival in Holland. On arrival, we checked the program to find out when we would be on stage: 8 p.m. on Saturday. Okay, great. I turned around, and there on the door of the conference hall opposite was an enormous poster. On Saturday at 8 p.m., the Dalai Lama in person would be giving a talk and a public audience. Incredible. Mother had organised everything. For the third time, I had been saved, even though I was still totally unaware of the danger. Shortly after that, I got my realization and began meditating with the Sahaja Yogis in Geneva in the new year, 1986.

It wasn't easy for Sahaja Yogis to teach in a French state school at that time, as we were being persecuted by an association called ADFI, and their accusations had led to Sahaja Yoga being added to a government list of dangerous sects to be kept under special surveillance. Any reference to Shri Mataji and Sahaja Yoga, or wearing a medallion with Mother's photograph, would lead to complaints to the government from the fathers of our students, many of whom were diplomats at the United Nations in Geneva and could cause serious trouble.

To try and spread vibrations in the school, I gave one international class of sixteen and seventeen-year-olds a big project to do together. We studied a number of peace activists and Nobel Prize winners, all of them realized souls: Abraham Lincoln, Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King, etc. Then, each group chose one of these inspiring figures and created posters with photos and information about all of them for an exhibition in the school hall for everyone to see. There was a parent-teacher meeting in school around that time, and I even got complimentary remarks from one or two diplomats. This project must have helped to improve vibrations, as I had hoped.

My first encounter with Shri Mataji in person was in spring 1986, when she came back to Europe from India and was giving a public program at a university in Geneva. After her talk, Mother invited the new people in the audience to come up on stage, and I joined the queue. When it was my turn to meet her, I knelt down in front of her with joined hands, as if in prayer. The Swiss yogi standing beside her said, "Mother, this is a new Sahaja Yogini." She looked at him and said, "I know," then took my joined hands in hers with a radiant smile full of love and tenderness, like a mother holding a little child's hand to support him when he's learning to walk. Just as she had protected me for so many years. Overcome with emotion, I could hardly speak. All I could say was, "Thank you, Mother. Thank you."

In 1988, the Swiss yogis decided to open a Sahaj primary school in Cabella for their own children and one or two others from different countries, and they asked me to be their English teacher. I was already teaching full-time, but I had no classes on Wednesdays. If I went to Cabella on Wednesdays, I would have to do all my marking on weekends. What is more, I had never taught such small children before. But after all, why not? When Shri Mataji came to the official opening ceremony at the school, I was there with the teachers, so I was fully compensated for giving up my free day. Here we have Shri Mataji looking at the present that the children have made for her, and we, the teachers, are on Mother's right. She then takes the scissors and cuts the ribbons to open the school. That is a beautiful memory.

At about that time, my mother fell ill with lymphoma. She had one tumor on her center heart and another in her throat and had to undergo chemotherapy, then radiotherapy that burned her vocal cords, leaving her practically voiceless and extremely weak. The cancer specialist in England told her she would never be able to speak normally again. Not only that, but my brother, who was only 38 years old, was diagnosed with brain cancer. My mother was desperate. When she called telling me, she sensed that I was not as upset as she had expected me to be and wanted to know why.

So I told her how I had discovered Sahaja Yoga and gotten my realization and described the effect that my encounter with Shri Mataji had had on me. She asked me to send her the only book about Sahaja Yoga that existed at that time, The Advent. So I posted it off to her straight away. The next time she called me, she had already read the whole book two or three times, and her only comment was, "I thought I was the one and only person to think like that." Then she asked if she could come to Geneva with my father to get her realization.

They came to stay with me, and I told them absolutely everything that I had learned about Sahaja Yoga in the six months I'd been meditating, including the fact that Shri Mataji is the Holy Spirit. My mother came to the collective meditation in Geneva with me, and the yogis gave her realization. After returning home, she tried to meditate on her own for a while but gave up. However, she always had a photo of Shri Mataji, and above all, Mother was in her heart.

She went to her regular check-up with the cancer specialist, and he asked her if she'd been having something different in the way of treatment. She told him that she had started doing Sahaja Yoga but no other treatment. "Whatever you do, keep it up. You're getting better," he said. At her next appointment, miraculously, both the tumor on the center heart and the one in her throat had vanished. Her vocal chords were cured, and she could speak normally. She was 65 at that time, and for 20 years after that, there was no trace of the lymphoma. Then, in 2008, it returned in the form of breast cancer, and she passed away two years later at the age of 88. My mother's spirit had achieved its aim. She had recognized and worshipped the Adi Shakti in her heart, even though she had never met her in person.

My brother lived for 10 years with brain cancer. He had several operations, and for the last two years of his life, he was paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair. After his second operation in 1986, I traveled to Hong Kong to spend some time with him. Every afternoon, I went to see him in the hospital. We talked and I read to him until he fell asleep. One day, while he slept, I raised his Kundalini, put him in bandhan, and prayed to Shri Mataji to bless him. Despite the fact that he was fast asleep, he must have felt his Kundalini in his Sahasrara, because he raised his right hand and massaged his fontanelle bone as he slept. Such a beautiful occurrence that I will never forget.

I spent Christmas 1987 on my first Sahaj India tour of Maharashtra with the yogis from Switzerland. I enjoyed singing with them and meeting yogis from Australia, New Zealand, and many other countries. The tour ended in Ganapatipule, and there, for the first time, I watched the Sahaj marriage ceremony. It was magical, like being in a dream or a fairy story—so bright, colourful, and full of joy. Nothing like the nightmare I had been through in my own marriage. Once bitten, twice shy. I definitely didn't want to risk another disaster. I was allergic to the very idea of marrying again. No more marriages for me.

The 1988 India tour started early, and I couldn't get time off school before the Christmas holidays. So I flew from Geneva to Mumbai and hired a taxi to take us to the tour location. The taxi dropped us off not far from a big tent. We had arrived in the middle of a puja, and Mother was already there. I dumped my luggage outside and went into a corner at the back of the tent, feeling very conspicuous and uncomfortable as I wasn't wearing a sari and wasn't feeling at all fresh.

At the end of the puja, while Mother was giving presents, I decided to take my suitcase and find a place where I could freshen up and change into a sari. I was about to do so when two yogis appeared. One of them, who turned out to be from Vienna, asked me, "Are you Elizabeth from Switzerland?" "Yes, why?" "This is your husband, Nicola." What? It was such a shock. I must have gaped at them incredulously because I hadn't filled in a marriage application. My previous marriage had lasted for ten extremely traumatic years, and I was bringing up my two teenage children on my own. Yet, for some reason, I couldn't react. I just surrendered. That was probably due to the effect of the puja, but also because nobody had said anything to me before, as I had arrived during the puja. Mother, once again, had organised everything in such a way that I just couldn't react. This was confirmed when Nicola and I did namaskar to Shri Mataji before the wedding. She looked at me with a sweet, loving smile on her face and said, "Don't think."

Our wedding was in Ganapatipule on the 28th of December, 1988. At the end of the next school year, in July 1989, I moved to Milan, where Nicola was working as a technical designer. We were so blessed that summer. Every weekend, the whole collective from Lombardy gathered at the Garlate ashram near Lecco, on the banks of Lake Como. When Shri Mataji came to do a public program in Milan, she stayed at the ashram and allowed us to worship her in the magnificent park by the lake. That was the one and only opportunity I ever had to do Lakshmi Puja to the Goddess in person, and I thank our Divine Mother from the bottom of my heart for having allowed me to do so.

The following year, 1990, she did public programs in sports stadiums all over Eastern Europe. In every country, thousands of people came to listen to her and get their self-realization. In the summer, Europeans accompanied her and remained in each country to do follow-ups. But in September, they had to go back to work, so extra help was needed. I was about to change jobs, but I was persuaded to start in October. And so, I went to Sofia in Bulgaria to do follow-ups twice a week for more than 200 people in the main lecture theatre at the university. Vibrations were fantastic when we did collective workshops with so many people.

Bulgaria was without a doubt the poorest country in Eastern Europe at that time. There was never much to buy in the shops. Most of the time, there was only tinned food on the shelves, and in the markets, there would be just potatoes one day and onions the next. How people survived was a mystery. And yet, every morning, the lady I was staying with gave me fresh Bulgarian yoghurt and fruit for breakfast. How did she manage it? I discovered later that one young yogi drove a taxi. As petrol was rationed, every day and all night if necessary, he would queue at the petrol station to fill up so that he could drive up into the mountains to get yoghurt and fruit for my breakfast. Several of those early yogis I met in Bulgaria have married in Sahaja Yoga and have lived in France, Spain, or Canada ever since. Such humble, generous people, so enthusiastic and open-hearted. It's a blessing to have such lovely brothers and sisters.

In 1991, Shri Mataji bought Palazzo Doria in Cabella, and there was a tremendous amount of renovation. For several years, we rented a little house on the other side of the river so that at weekends, we could come down from Milan to help. Then came Mani Pulite, the "Clean Hands" crisis, during which top managers in Italy were arrested for corruption, and lots of smaller businesses had to close down, including the one Nicola worked for. By now, he was 45 years old, and however hard he tried, it was impossible to find another job.

As I'd been employed by the French government, I had applied for six years of temporary retirement to move to Milan, but that was now coming to an end. If I didn't return to work in France, I would lose my job. Nicola didn't want to leave Milan, but the vibrations weren't at all clear. I asked for guidance. The answer was clear-cut: as I still had a teaching post in France, I should go back there.

So, for the beginning of the school year in 1995, I returned to teach at the international school on the border with Switzerland. After two months alone in Milan, Nicola joined me. We remained in France until I retired, only returning to Italy for pujas in Cabella and to visit Nicola's family. In France, Nicola could only find odd jobs to do, and it was obvious that he was dissatisfied. Unfortunately, the Nabhi problems he had always had were getting worse, but he refused to go to the specialist appointments I made for him.

At Christmas 2006, I retired, and we moved back to Italy, but he still refused to see a specialist. When he eventually agreed to have a gastroscopy three years later, the cancer had spread to his whole stomach, which had to be removed. He then had to undergo both chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

In the early morning of December 24th, 2012, he suffered a stroke. By the time we got down to the emergency room, his right side was paralyzed, and he could no longer speak. Then the Ganas took over. While we were waiting for the doctor, we were alone in a small room, and I was able to give him vibrations, say the mantras out loud, and pray to Mother to help him. Nicola seemed calm and serene.

In the evening, he was taken up to a room where there was an elderly patient whose daughter was visiting. While the doctor examined Nicola, I chatted with her. When the doctor had finished, he told me that Nicola's situation was stable, but that it would be up to him to decide whether he wanted to carry on living in such a miserable condition. An emergency call came for the doctor. He was right. Nicola had made up his mind. He had left us. It was 7:30 p.m. on Christmas Eve, and the Christmas Puja was just starting in Cabella. Nicola had chosen to join his brothers and sisters worshipping at the lotus feet of our Divine Mother.

On Christmas Day, the lady I had spoken to at the hospital came to see me. She told me that while I was with the doctor, she had gone back into the room to see her father. Nicola had smiled at her and waved his hand. She went to her father's bed, and for a few minutes, her back was turned to Nicola. When she turned around, he had stopped breathing. She was convinced that he was saying goodbye to me with a smile. From the expression on his face, we could see that he was peaceful and serene. Thank you, Mother, for your love and infinite compassion.

In April 2014, my father, who was living with me, passed away shortly before his 95th birthday. I was now alone up in my mountain refuge, free to go to all the pujas in Cabella, public programs in Liguria, and a Sahaja Yoga course for foreign students at the university in Genoa. I was so happy to be a full-time yogini at last.

In 2017, I spent two months in Asia. One week in Delhi with a Swiss yogini, another week with the yogis in Bangkok, and then on to Laos, Myanmar, and Cambodia to see Angkor Wat before flying on to Melbourne, Australia. After a week in South Australia, I flew to Uluru to worship. Visitors can explore only one side of the rock. In the caves, we see a little Ganesha who has been bathing in a pool on the rock after some welcome rain. The orange rocks change colour during the day, becoming red and then brown as the sun goes down. Jai Shri Ganesha.

Before Christmas 2018, I drove to where my daughter lived to stay with the grandchildren. When I arrived, she immediately made me feel unwelcome, behaving as if she was still an adolescent in crisis. As soon as I could, I drove on to the island where my son Stefan lives. I spent three peaceful weeks there. Although Stefan has never wanted to try Sahaja Yoga, he respects my ideas and values. He welcomed the idea when I suggested teaching his daughters to meditate on the beach. So I was able to give them realization.

From there, I drove down to southwest France to stay with a French yogini. Together, we did three weeks of wellness, meditating and working intensively on our subtle systems. When I left for the eight-hour drive back to my daughter's place, I was absolutely full of cool vibrations. My intention was to pick up a suitcase and maybe spend the night. My daughter was alone and became aggressive as soon as she saw me. She obviously couldn't stand my vibrations. I was shocked, shaken, and upset. Despite the fact that the roads were icy and jammed, I decided to leave immediately. Without Mother's help and protection, I could never have managed to drive back home over Mont Blanc. I was in such a state.

For three months after that, I struggled with a very heavy left side. I did my best to work on it, but there seemed to be no way out of the tunnel. That summer, after Guru Puja in Cabella, I came down with bronchitis. At the end of October, I was trying to organize a public program when I got up from the table after lunch, fainted, and started to vomit. I was taken to the emergency unit at the hospital. The test results were normal, so they just gave me a blood transfusion and sent me home. But that night, I collapsed again, and my blood pressure was so low that I couldn't get out of bed. By the fourth day, I was getting weaker and weaker and began to see flashing lights, like little angels all around me. I really thought my last hour had come.

I was taken to emergency again, in semi-intensive care this time. They discovered that I had a tumor at the top of my stomach, between my left Nabhi and my heart, and it was bleeding. Ruled by left Nabhi: peace and serenity in your family, which didn't exist in my family. Heart chakra: the mother-daughter relationship, which was so difficult. So at the end of November, they removed half my stomach.

On Christmas Eve 2018, the specialist announced to me that all was well, that I wouldn't need chemotherapy or radiation because I was cured. For me, it is obvious that Mother was present throughout this ordeal, showing me how dangerous attachments can be, either to family or to anything else. I'm doing my best to destroy this conditioning and forgive my daughter, with whom I have had no further contact for five years now.

In the hospital, I meditated all day, every day. I read Mother's talks, and my attention was always on her. I surrendered everything to her: "Mother, your will be done." Other patients and even the nurses asked me how I managed to remain so calm, if I wasn't scared. They could feel the strength that Mother's attention and protection gave me. You might think I'm exaggerating when I say that this experience was precious and enriching for me. I felt no pain, only divine love and protection. I was just a baby in my Mother's arms. A truly golden memory.

Praise be to you, who is our sweet and loving Mother. Praise be to you for guiding us through the labyrinth of life.

Jai Shri Mataji. Jai Shri Mataji. Jai Shri Mataji.
