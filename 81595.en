 (England)
I was brought up as a Catholic, and I felt that wasn't it. In the church, I felt like an intruder. So I became a communist, and then I discovered that communism wasn't very good either. I didn't really know what I wanted or what was going to happen. I didn't think I was a seeker, but obviously I was, because people didn't seem to make sense. They were living with contradictions in their lives all the time, and I couldn't make out what it was all about.

One day, I cycled to the lake. It was five o'clock in the morning, and I was quite tired; it was a long ride. I just stretched on the ground. The sun was rising, the daisies were growing around me, and I suddenly became one with nature. I instantly thought, "Well, this is God," because it was such a strong experience. I came back home and announced to everybody that God really exists.

I had been trying to come to England for seven years but was refused a passport. After this experience, everything started to happen very quickly in my life. I was able to get the passport and come to England in 1977. There, I came across different seeking books and bought lots of them. I was going to different meditation groups, and I was training to be a Hatha Yoga teacher.

Then one day, about a week before I came to the program in Caxton Hall, various people started meeting me at random. They were looking at my hands and saying, "You really have healing hands." I thought, "Well, I don't think so," but if they say so. Then a friend of mine came to my flat and said, "I met this lady. She healed my back. She's really a great healer." So I thought maybe I'd better come along and check it out.

I came to Caxton Hall, and it was quite amazing. Shri Mataji was wearing a white sari. There were these two big Indian standing lamps, and they were on both sides of her, burning. She looked very majestic and very, very powerful. She gave a talk, and then she asked us to go into meditation. I had this very strong experience, like a fountain just opened at the base of my spine and went, really, through my stomach and up. I was completely shaken by the experience.

Afterward, I went to Mother's feet. I had a burning in my heart, obviously from doing Hatha Yoga, so I was thinking, "What is this burning?" Then, Mother just looked at me and said, "Your problem is here." She was very sweet. She was saying, "Do you catch colds?" I was thinking, "Colds? Yes, I do." And she was saying, "Yes, you are very joyful," because I was smiling and she was smiling. I just knew I had arrived at my destination.

But the interesting thing was that the next day, I started to feel very strange. I was walking along the street, and I felt that I had Shri Mataji's hair. It was so bizarre. I was walking just like she did, and I thought, "Am I ever going to be myself again?" because I was moving how she did. It was quite strange. Later on, I found out, obviously, that Shri Mataji says that we are all one, so we are in her body. From that perspective, I now understand that through this Self-Realization, I was taken by Shri Mataji into her body.

Of course, then I tried to find out about all the secret things, like the ashram. That was very difficult. I tried to find out the address, but nobody wanted to give it to me. Douglas was operating the recording equipment, so at the next meeting, when Shri Mataji wasn't there, I said to him, "Maybe I can help you." He said, "Alright." Then I said, "By the way, do you know the address of the ashram?" He just looked at me, checked my kundalini, and said, "I suppose I can give it to you."

So I went to the ashram the following week. It was the Sahasrara Puja in 1980. I just thought I was popping in, but the puja had started, so I stayed. To my great surprise, Shri Mataji called me to do the puja. It went on for quite a while. Then, strangely, after the puja, there was a havan, which is normally the other way around. Shri Mataji asked me to do the havan with everybody else. It was the thousand names with translations, so it took about four hours. After 20 minutes, I started to feel amazing, but at the same time, things were clearing up, and my legs were not really up to it, though I was quite used to sitting on the floor. I looked outside the window and saw it was getting dark. It had started at 9 o'clock in the morning.

After the havan, there was a music program. By the time I left, I felt very, very clear inside. I think ever since then, I have never missed any programs or any pujas. I just couldn't have enough of them.
