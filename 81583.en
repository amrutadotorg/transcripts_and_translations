I was trying to improve my martial arts. I was involved in the martial arts, and you're trying to achieve this state of moksha, the Japanese style, but we weren't getting anywhere. A friend of mine had been to Mother's meetings, but he didn't tell me about it. He couldn't make Shri Mataji out, so he gave me this tape, one of those old cassette tapes. He said, "See what you think of that, what's your opinion."

So I sat in the garden one August afternoon and put this tape on. Mother's voice sounded so pure to me. I called Brenda out and said, "Come and listen to this lady's voice. It's 100% pure." I didn't know why I was saying it, because what she was talking about didn't make any sense to me. But I just knew that this lady had something. I felt something here, in my heart, but nowhere else. I couldn't make any sense of it.

To cut a long story short, I phoned my friend up and said, "Where did you get this tape from?" "Well, I've been going to Crouch End, and she goes there. But she's coming to my home before a meeting in the East End of London. If you want to come over, you can meet her there."

So Brenda and I went over to his place. As we turned into the street, there were all these people outside his house. It was a hot summer day, and they've all got scarves on and everything. I thought, "This is a bit strange." He had this big wooden Buddha, and they were taking it out and putting it in his garden. I said, "What are they doing to your Buddha, John?" He says, "It's got bhoots, so it's got to go in there." I said, "What do you mean, it's got bhoots?" He said, "Well, they'll tell you." I asked this young fellow, "Are you cold, mate?" He said, "No, I'm protecting my Vishuddhi." I didn't know what he was talking about.

We were in the garden talking to these people, and I had some of my students with me because we thought we were going to get this Moksha to improve our martial arts. Then someone shouted, "Jai Shri Mataji," and Mother came into the room.

We all followed her into the room. She sat down right about where you're sitting now. This young Sahaja Yogini came along and went to her feet. And as this girl, Kathy, went to her feet, we saw the Kundalini go up her back. Mother said, "Ah, do you see the Kundalini? Do you see the Kundalini?" It was a distinct, transparent snake. That's just what it looked like. We were all dumbfounded. I looked at her and I said, "Yeah."

My friend had two sons who, in those days, were skinheads. They didn't like foreigners and weren't going to have any coming into the house. They had their boots on and everything. But when we looked around, they'd both come in from the garden. Their boots were off. No one told them to do this, but no one could dispute what we had just seen.

My friend's wife had just left him, and he had five children. Mother said to my wife, Brenda, "Are these your children?" And she said, "No, no, they're not my children, Mother." So she said, "Well, where are your children?" She said, "They're at home." "Bring them to the meeting tonight." So we shot home and got the kids.

We went back that evening and sat in front of Mother, and all my students were there as well. Mother was saying to each of them, "You're very right-sided. What are you doing?" And they were saying, "Martial arts." By the time she got to me, I felt really guilty. I thought it was all my fault. When she worked on me, it just felt like an ice cream cone above my head. Then someone said, "Can you say the Lord's Prayer?" And I said, "Well, I don't know it." So they said it for me. They asked, "Can you feel the cool breeze?" And I could feel this up here. I thought a window was open somewhere. Mother said, "Can you feel it?" I said, "Yeah." But it didn't make any sense to me. It felt very good, but it was all completely alien.

Then she went along to my oldest son. I'd just lost my brother, who was very fond of my son, and my son was still worried about him. She said to my oldest son, "Ah, there's someone here protecting you. You lost someone recently." He said, "It's my uncle. I love him." And she said, "Well, you tell him you're okay now, and he'll be fine. You let him go." He didn't want to let him go, but he did eventually. Then some yogis were going to work on our younger two children, and Mother said, "No, no, no, no, no. They're realised. You leave them. Leave them."

[Another speaker, Brenda, continues]

My experience was when Rupert was in the garden with his men. I was at the kitchen door, leaning, sort of half listening to what was going on inside and half listening to what was outside. I didn't hear the house clear out, but the next voice I heard was, "Hello." I turned around, and... well, I don't know how I restrained myself from running and kissing her. It was as if my heart recognized her, but the brain didn't. I thought, "What are you doing? Control yourself."

I walked up, took her hand, and said, "I'm so glad you could come." And she just hugged me. It was such a wonderful experience. You can only relate it to your earthly mother if you've not seen her for years and suddenly you see her and think, "Ah, Mum!" You really want to go and run and hug and kiss them. Well, that's exactly how I felt. But, of course, your brain doesn't understand your heart, does it? Everything else that Rupert said is extremely accurate.

[The first speaker, Rupert, concludes]

Yeah, it was fantastic. Absolutely. For years I couldn't comprehend what was going on that night. For about two years, I didn't believe these vibrations were coming from me. I kept saying, "There's a door open somewhere." I couldn't comprehend this cool breeze. And even when I did, it didn't make a lot of sense to me because I was brought up in a different culture. People would say, "This is the Kundalini." And I thought, "Okay, well, so what?"
