On the way there, my feet were walking because I couldn't run away, but my heart was racing. I didn't know why.

Do you have any idea what a goddess would be like?

Just after that, she asked us to come up. She put her hand on me and said, "This one is sick. What have you been doing to yourself?" She basically said I'd exhausted all the possible ways of damage. When I was walking in, I was in a bad state, but I was also quite aware of other dimensions. I walked in the room expecting a quiet atmosphere, maybe someone tinkling a bell in the background.

Oh, she turned around and blew me a kiss as she left.

One more interesting thing: to sort of prove that the Thrava had opened—I don't know whether you remember this or not—she said, "Cover your ears." She spoke to us while we had our hands clasped over our ears like that, and we could still hear what she was saying. She said, "You're hearing me through the Thrava." That was quite amazing.

I was going to ask you, was there a particular experience that helped you relax? Because so far, I think you were looking for a...
