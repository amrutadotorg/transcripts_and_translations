 (England)
Okay, so this is our fourth and final session of sari stories. We're going to start with Rosalind's sari story, and then there'll be a little bit of a hiatus while I switch everything around for Gary's sari story. Okay, Rosalind.

Okay, well, I've just been looking through some old diaries to try and find the date of this, and I cannot pin the date, so other yoginis might remember when it was. It was an India tour. And both of the stories, they're very, very short, were on India tours. It could have been my first India tour, actually, ‘89, ‘90. We stayed overnight there. I don't know if anyone remembers this, whether Daniel was there. I think it was the year that the Italians had brought some pasta. Everybody was a little bit fed up with the tour food, and the pasta came, and everybody was very cheerful about that. But anyway, I'd put my name down on the marriage list.

I was very nervous about it. They told me—all I could go on was what yogis told me about how things go—and they told me that you need a certain amount of money if you're going to get married. So I duly took out a lot of money in England and changed it at the airport into rupees. And I had this large pile of money in my bag wandering around India, worrying about this money. You need this money to pay for the marriage, or you might have to pay for the marriage.

Anyway, when we got to Pakistan, Shri Mataji had all of these beautiful, beautiful saris brought in—well, they were outside on tables in the garden.

(Something just came up about Spanish on my screen.)

We were looking to see the saris. We were able to choose a sari, and I saw one that I really liked. It was a dark, almost like a midnight blue thing. It had silver stars and things on it, and I really loved this sari. Once I'd got my eye on that one, I couldn't really forget about it. But I kept thinking about this money and the marriage, and I didn't know what to do. I was very new. I had only been in Sahaj for about 18 months, and that was my first time in India, so I didn't really know how things worked.

Anyway, I must have decided not to go for the sari and to save the money in case I got married. And then I saw over the next few days or the next puja that we had, girls had bought this sari and were wearing it to the puja. So you can imagine how I felt. I didn't get the sari, and I didn't get a husband either. So it was a big lesson in being surrendered. But, of course, I didn't really know about surrender then. All of the other stories on saris, people have been able to show either a picture or the actual sari, so it was a bit sad.

It's funny how you remember things like that, though, because it was a real lesson to just live in the moment, really, and go for whatever was being put in front of you. That's the thing to do. So that was that.

And then there's only one other very short story, again, on an India tour. It's not really about a sari, but it's about a Punjabi suit. I don't know whether it was that same tour, but Shri Mataji had taken us all to the theatre. All I had in mind was I wanted to have a Punjabi suit. I'd seen other girls in them, and I really liked them and thought they looked very comfortable. And again, I was very attached. I couldn't get my mind off wanting a Punjabi suit, and we hadn't been anywhere to buy anything until this one day when we were near a town. I can't really remember where it was. That's why I've been trying to look in my diaries for the date.

Another yogini from Germany said she'd come with me. And she came with me, and I tried one on. I'm very tall and have quite broad shoulders, so not all of them fit me very well. This one did, and I bought it. I asked her opinion, and she said it's okay. And then I wore it that night or one night for the theatre. It happened to be—I didn't really mean it to happen—but I just happened to be right at the side where Shri Mataji was walking out when we'd finished the play at the theatre. And she just looked at me and very, very firmly, I mean, really firmly, said, "Children's clothes." She said it directly at me. And then she turned away to the rest of the collective and said, "Oh, you can buy them in such and such a place. You can buy children's clothes."

It was quite a shock because she looked directly at me and said very firmly, "Children's clothes." It took me a while to understand, but I thought afterwards that she was telling me, "No, that's not the right thing to wear." And now I know about things, it was actually quite a very young Punjabi suit. It wasn't really suitable for me. So obviously, I should have had a sari on really.

And that's it, really. Those are my two very short stories.

Host: Well, they're both lovely. And just so emblematic, I think is the word I'm looking for, of these things that happened to us that we really recognize as lessons. Especially, I think, in the early days when we're changing so much so quickly, and these incidents happen and we know that they are specifically happening so that we'll learn something from them.

Rosalind: Yes, exactly. That's exactly right. I knew even then they were happening to teach me something, but it's a bit of a blur. You're not quite sure at the time, but of course, you learn later.

Host: Very funny. Thank you very much, Rosalind. I'm going to remove the pin from you. And Gary, can you switch your camera on, please, my dear.

Gary: So here I am.

Host: Yeah, lovely. And now you're pinned also for the recording, which is continuing. So I've got these images lined up. Just let me know when to put them up.

Gary: Okay. Well, I'll introduce myself for the people who don't know me. I'm Gary, originally from Australia. I got my realization in 1981 in Australia, and I've been living in Austria now for the last 40 years. I’m married to Hamid Mirani, who quite a few of you probably know. My stories are varied.

Initially, when we went on the first India tours, Shri Mataji was giving out saris to all of the women on the tour. It was such a joy to wonder what color you were going to get. There was always this red one or a blue one or a green one. They were the first saris we were ever given in 1981.

I've got one sari here. This one was, I think, from 1982. So it's a good 42 years old, this sari, and it's still in very, very good condition. As you can see, it's a cotton sari. We were allowed to bow down to Shri Mataji's feet, and then she gave us the saris personally. So it really still has very nice vibrations, even though it's such an old sari which I haven't worn for a long time. But it's this pure cotton, really lovely sari.

The main story that I'm going to say today is about how I actually got my name, Gauri. In 1988, as many of you know, there were the nine nights of the Devi, and it was celebrated in Pune. My husband was working in Pakistan—he went there for at least five consecutive years. In 1988, we decided we would go with him, with a nine-month-old baby and a three-year-old little girl. So we boarded the plane and we landed in Bombay. Hamid, because he was doing work in the garden while we were there, he'd taken a lot of seeds and earth and different things from Austria that probably were not really allowed to be imported into India. But he just brought them all and surrendered.

When we got to the airport, the lady said, "Look, I'm sorry, but you'll have to go into quarantine." It was two o'clock in the morning, with two little kids there, and I thought, how are we going to do this? So, bandhans, bandhans. Suddenly, a lady came out of the blue with a white sari on. She looked at the little girls and she said, "Don't worry. You can just go straight through. Don't tell anybody, don't look at anything, just go straight through." And she said to Hamid, "Now you go and plant your garden. Don't worry."

So we got into Bombay, and then the next day we went to Pune. Hamid was working at the garden every day and going each day to the pujas. He was able to do the whole nine pujas. In the course of this time, I received a sari through Hamid. Shri Mataji said to Hamid, "What's your wife's name?" And he said, "Glenda." She said, "That's not a good name. That means 'lady from the valley' or 'lady from the glen.' And she should be more from the mountain." It means white or snow or up in the mountains, Shri Parvati and Shri Shiva. So she gave me the name Gauri. That was how I got my name, but not directly from Shri Mataji—through Hamid, actually.

And this is the sari. My Gauri sari, I call it. It's very old now, and I've worn it a few times, so it's not in the best condition, but it's still a very precious sari, naturally.

The puja was on the 16th of October, as far as I remember, in Pune. I was actually allowed to go up on the stage and do the puja. But at the time, I was feeding my child, the little one. And suddenly, my name was called: "Hamid's wife." So I had to kind of quickly button my blouse up and walk all the way up to the stage. And Daya came up with me. She wasn't supposed to, but she came trotting up in her little sari, which was so cute, actually. She was only three. And she ended up actually doing the whole puja. Shri Mataji was so enthralled by her because she was being so good. She was offering the bracelets, and she was offering the perfume. It was a very, very powerful puja. You can imagine, it's the Navaratri puja. It was really, really special.

Afterwards, when we got back home, Shri Mataji invited us to Pratishthan. And so we went, and we were in a private room with Shri Mataji. She was saying to me, "I don't know how to pay Hamid for all the work he's been doing in Pratishthan, in the garden." And she was looking right at me. And somehow, inside of my head was, "He always wanted a son." This was somehow in my head. And then Shri Mataji looked at me very, very knowingly, let's say. I was sitting there, and I was thinking, "Oh, yes. Okay."

Then when we got to Australia, because we went to Australia after India, Shri Mataji invited us back for Ganapatipule. When we got to Australia, I felt very tired. I wasn't feeling very well at all. I was still breastfeeding my daughter, the middle daughter. We got to Ganapatipule, and I didn't feel well at all. I thought, gosh, I hope I'm not pregnant again. Anyway, I got back to Austria, and I was.

About a year after this, a lady came into the room in Pertelsdorf—Sara, actually, she might even be online, I don't know. And Shri Mataji said, "Why isn't she going to India?" And I said, "Oh, she's pregnant, Shri Mataji." Then Shri Mataji looked at me. She said, "But you were pregnant." And I said, "Yes, but I didn't know, Shri Mataji." She said, "Oh, yes, but I did." And this was the time when I was pregnant in Ganapatipule.

This was the sari Shri Mataji sat on in Pertelsdorf when she was talking about this. So that was a really nice moment. Shri Mataji gave me quite a few saris, not always personally. I got them mostly through Hamid. But this one I got personally, and this was at Sara Shah Day. I think it was about 1997, around this time. Hamid was leader of Austria for quite some time, so this is why I received quite a lot of saris.

This sari I remember. Shri Mataji gave me this sari when Iran and Australia were holding Guru Puja, and this was actually given to me for Iran. So that's this sari. I have other saris here. There's about four or five saris that were given to me at different times during Hamid's leadership. Sabina Huckle also has more or less the same saris; we were given them, and we both got saris the same together.

Host: I'm just going to put up the picture of your name in the frame as well.

Gary: Yeah. Okay. That would be nice. This is Shri Mataji's handwriting. It was so special when I received the sari with the name written, my name written down, Glenda, which was really quite amazing that Shri Mataji wrote my name. And then underneath she writes it in Hindi, and then underneath that, Gauri. Edward was so kind to frame it for me, and I've kept it ever since. It's a very beautiful thing to have. You can see the Hindi is at the bottom.

Host: Yes, please. As many as you have.

Gary: I don't have that many sari stories. Well, I can tell you another story about my daughter, actually. She put on a fashion show of all Indian clothing, and it was part of her getting into university in Australia. It was at La Donna Mesa, it's called, the woman's exhibition. I had 16 girls parading with all different types of clothes down in my cellar for quite a few months before this, but it was really powerful.

They started off with the Mooladhara, and they had everything in red. So there were red Punjabis, red saris, and it was just a mixture. And then they danced to it and came out in a very good display. They started off with the Mooladhara and then they went up to Swadhisthan, went up to all the colors of the chakras. And the last one was a wedding. They had the Indian clothes on for the wedding as well, the wedding saris on. It was a really nice thing to do, and it just showed you how auspicious Indian clothing is. It was very successful, actually, and she used it and got into university with this presentation of her work. So it was actually a really, really lovely thing.

Host: What was she studying, Gary?

Gary: Oh, she did film, Communication in Film and Media. She got her bachelor's in Australia with that. Unfortunately, she can't use it because she's in the Czech Republic with two little boys at the moment, so she's not really doing the job she worked for. But she'll get back to it, probably.

Host: No, I mean, that is a lovely story. I do have also this picture of you and Christine.

Gary: Yeah, I don't know whether Christine's online, but I think she might be. Christine and I came to Sahaja Yoga around about the same time. We were both born in 1952. Somebody happened to walk past and see us both sitting there with our saris on and took a photo. It was just after Christine did her sari presentation as well, so it was really nice to have it. It was at Shri Kartikeya Puja recently.

Yes, if you put it up, I can tell another story about that sari. We were both sitting there, and the sari I have on was actually one of these saris where Shri Mataji bought them all. I think they were from China, and she said we all should take one. I think they were all free; I don't believe we paid for them even. And I chose this one, and the altar happened to be exactly the same color as my sari. It was gold and this sort of petrol color. It's a very comfortable sari to wear, but it's also one that Shri Mataji bought and gave to the collective to choose.

Quite often, I was ironing Shri Mataji's saris for the program. I remember ironing her white saris. That was extremely powerful. You just went into meditation ironing her sari. Of course, you were a little bit nervous that you didn't do it properly. But I remember ironing her beautiful white sari for the program. That was amazing.

We were very, very blessed to be so often with Shri Mataji, and we can't thank her enough for allowing us this time with her. We were so close. In the early days in India, we were able to offer garlands around her neck every day. Sometimes we were at Shri Mataji's feet for 10 minutes while she worked on us, and we felt amazing afterwards. I remember one time when Shri Mataji gave us all the bindi and worked on our agyas. It was really powerful. These first India tours were very, very personal, and we were very often called by our name. Shri Mataji gave us little Ganeshas in our hands, and we received so much in those first India tours. That's why these saris, also receiving them personally from Shri Mataji, is such an amazing blessing. We treasure them, and I've looked after them all these years. I don't wear them. It's something that I've kept.

Especially my Gauri sari. That was a very special time. It wasn't easy with two little girls there in India for three weeks while Hamid was enjoying the Navaratri pujas every day in Pratishthan. I was there with the two girls in this private home. But the blessings came, and the time we had in Pratishthan with Shri Mataji at that time was very special. It was just my family, just our family with the two little kids. And Shri Mataji was talking about the little kids, "Oh look, see the lovely kids." They were really nice, and they were well-behaved. It was such a special, close time with Shri Mataji, and we will never forget it. Also in Ganapatipule, we were invited to Ganapatipule that year, and that was a very special year too, 1988.

I mean, I can go on, I suppose, with different stories, but they’re not sari stories then. Maybe somebody else likes to tell a story. Is there somebody online that wants to tell a story spontaneously?

Rosalind: Gary, when you talked about Hamid in the garden, I remember all the Austrians. He wanted all these trees from Austria. So we all were going to the India tour, and every one of us had a little tree, smaller than us, and we brought them on the planes with us. In those days, you just seemed to get through, didn't you? We had trees, and the plane was filled with these trees that we were bringing for Mother's Garden.

Gary: We had all of these seeds, boxes and boxes of seeds he brought in. We checked them all in, and it actually would have been really illegal to bring them all in. There were seeds from all over the world. I think Hamid was asking for people to donate things from all around the world or all over Europe, and he gathered them all. So it wasn't normal to come in with all these seeds.

I remember this so clearly, this lady in the white sari coming up like a savior. It was like Shri Mataji was in this woman. She just came up and she said, "Oh, just go through. You plant a nice garden." But the way she said it was just so beautiful. She just sort of knew that it was something special. It was so nice. And he planted such a beautiful garden. It was like a paradise garden, like the Garden of Eden.

Rosalind: And then they razed it, I believe. Then at one point, it was completely bulldozed by one of the sisters.

Gary: Oh yeah, it's not there anymore. Hamid went there every year for two months. He had a two-month holiday after his work, and every year for two months he was working in Pratishthan. In fact, he was working there when my second child was born.

Host: How many years did he do that for, Gary?

Gary: Four or five years in a row, consecutive years. You had to, because he had to watch it, make sure it was going to grow properly, and then new plants were planted. It was a lot of work. A lot of work.

Host: Betty from the US wants to know if you had a son after you were thinking about wanting a son.

Gary: No, we didn't have a son. We had a third daughter, who lives in America, actually. No, we didn't get our son. Each child was a son for Hamid, and they're all daughters. But they've got sons. Well, Daya's got two sons.

I went on an India tour pregnant. I was five months pregnant, and I went on my last India tour with my first child. Yes, I didn't know. But then a year later, when my daughter was already one, Shri Mataji looked at me, and it was just so amazing. She said, "Well, I knew you were pregnant." I was just sitting there, I thought, "Oh my gosh, of course you knew."

I got into a little bit of trouble when I came back, because that was the year, 1991-1992, when everybody got hepatitis. Oh yeah, including me, pregnant. But I had no symptoms, unlike other people. I only found out because I was getting the regular pregnancy blood test and they said, "Oh, do you know you've got hepatitis B?" Wow. My gynecologist wasn't very impressed, I have to say. I came back from India, you know, and went to the gynecologist. I was already two and a half months pregnant. I was shocked, actually. I just had no idea at the time. And yeah, that was the gift for Pratishthan. She's the gift.

Host: Okay. Well, I'm going to stop the recording now.
