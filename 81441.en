We definitely had one of these rooms here and one upstairs, as you said, Douglas. Here's the main entrance, where we stood many times, waiting to see her off. Her car would be here. We'd all gather, and the poor caretaker would be there saying, "It's really time, I have to shut the door," and we'd move another inch further forward. The whole pavement would be full of Sahaja Yogis and new people wondering what the big deal was. And then Shri Mataji would be there in her car, and off she'd drive. Then we'd finally, reluctantly, go off to the Spaghetti House for our supper.

If you walk up a little bit to the door... I'll just follow you along. That's the way it goes, isn't it? I guess that looks like the original door. It's strange because it always used to be nighttime here, didn't it? You'd seldom see it in the light. No, it was always a night watching Mother get into the car or get out of the car at the front.

It was 30 years ago. If you look, it looks slightly different. The pillars... and these are new anyway. It looked clean and neat. Wasn't there an awning over here? Like a Victorian glass thing with wrought iron at the top. That's why initially I didn't recognise it. It was a municipal building; it was Westminster City Council's building. You might find some early pictures on the net, actually.

There was a fire. There were a couple of fires here. Well, there was a fire whilst we were here. When you went in, there was the entrance to the main hall, and then I think there was a stairway on the left that went up and around. There was a balcony, sort of a gangway or a balcony along the back. It was a mezzanine floor that led to those rooms up there. And I remember that stairway was burnt. I don't know quite how the thing caught fire.

How long did we have meetings here? Until about '82 or '83. I don't know until I look at the tapes. It was quite a few years. Five, seven years, something like that. I think until at least '82. We started in '77. So we left college... well, you left college in '82. In 1981, they were definitely... yes. So '82 or '83, I would think. We'll check from the list of tapes.

Right, let's have a look. There we are. Look. Caxton Hall. You can see where Caxton Hall starts. October '77. The 24th of the 11th, right? No, it's '77. Caxton Hall... I reckon '83. Caxton Hall there... That's '80. Caxton Hall... Caxton Hall. Still at the bottom. Oh, do you remember that one at Stratford? Yes, I do very well, because that was where you were marked, wasn't it? Yes, that was it. Was that '84? No, '80. Yes, that was when I was pregnant with Athena. Right, Caxton Hall there... that's '80. So we're in 1980. Putney there... '81. I think it's going to be '82. Yes, it's got to be '82.

No, we never had pujas here. Just public programs, talks.

We'd get a few hundred people, two or three hundred anyway. The Great Hall helped. I'm sure that first meeting there was a lot, about 200 at the very least. But after this first meeting here, our numbers went up from six or seven to 60 or 70, didn't they? Straight away. The numbers stayed about the same for the next few years, but they did change. People would come and people would go.

'83. So it was from '77 to '83. Six years. That's a long time.

I remember we used to do the meetings, wouldn't we? Blow the conch at the end and all bow down and leave all these poor new people standing up like lemons. But most of the time... do you remember we went to the flower store and bought all those flowers and decorated it just like we did the Altar Hall? It's amazing. All the microphones. Incredible.

So here we are in Christchurch Gardens, City of Westminster. And over the road, we've got the famous Caxton Hall. This distinctive Victorian red brick building on Caxton Street is Caxton Hall, opened on 19th July 1883 as Westminster Town Hall. During the next hundred years, it served a wide variety of purposes, for example, as a venue for concerts and public meetings for the jet movement. During World War II, it was also used by the Ministry of Information for press conferences given by Sir Winston Churchill and his ministers.

From 1933 to 1977, many thousands of couples were married at Caxton Hall in the Westminster Registry Office. It gained a reputation for hosting many social weddings and those of the rich and famous, including Sir Anthony Eden, Ingrid Bergman's third marriage, Elizabeth Taylor's marriage to Michael Wilding, Peter Sellers, Roger Moore, Diana Dors (twice married here), George Harrison, and Ringo Starr.

And from 1978 up to its closure in 1983, Caxton Hall continued to be used by a wide variety of organisations as a venue for meetings, including, of course, Sahaja Yoga meetings hosted by Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi. And it is a Grade II listed building.

We didn't really know what was going to happen at all. Even when we were on the tour, we were amazed by the sort of speech. I mean, the first time we did that was in Cambridge. They used to do national tours all the time. Sir C.P. was off on business, and Shri Mataji went to my hometown, Middlesbrough. She went to Derby, Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds. She went to Leeds a lot.

And during the day, when she would stay overnight, she would go shopping. One has been captured on film. Someone filmed her shopping for crockery in Derby, because Derby's near the potteries, near Wedgwood. And there's film of her just going around this lovely crockery shop with lots of Sahaja Yogis just following behind, on the tail of a comet, really. She used to love that.

When she'd speak, she would speak about the area itself. My hometown's an industrial town. Before the Victorian era, there was nothing there. Then they discovered iron ore in the local hills, and steel. With Sheffield, Teesside and Sheffield were the two centers of the steel industry in England for a long time. So Mother came to Middlesbrough and gave a talk in the college, the polytechnic there. She would drive around and ask about the locale where she was going to speak. I drove her around and across the Transporter Bridge, across the River Tees. I drove Mother across the Transporter Bridge, which is quite a famous bridge. She asked me what the town was. I said it was built on steel.

We had just had our third child, our second son, and she was staying in my friend's flat. We didn't have a name for him; he was only a few weeks old. I said, "Mother, can you name him?" She said, "What's this town built on?" I said, "Oh, it's built on steel, Mother." She said, "Oh, we'll call him Samarth, which is the man who was equal to his own name. And we'll call him Samson as well." So he's called Samarth Samson. And I said, "That's beautiful." He was named in a steel town, so he's like a man of steel. It's beautiful.

So I think that was the Spaghetti House there. That was the tabula calda, which means "the hot table." After the Caxton Hall meetings, most times, we would all decant to the tabula calda. There'd be 20, 30, 40 of us in there. And occasionally, Mother would come and sit upstairs in the corner table. But it's shut now. It wasn't another particularly significant or auspicious building, but it's great memories for us all from 1979 and the early '80s until Caxton Hall shut. It's a shame we didn't get in there, but the lights are on upstairs.

Right, we have to find somewhere else. Look what they've done to the Spaghetti House. It's gone. Oh well. We've done the work, move on. It's gone to a better place.

Shouldn't we all be talking about deep, profound memories? Absolutely. It's all relevant. Just shooting a bit of the flavor of London, anyway.

This is the way I came three months ago in the taxi, somewhere around here, where we got behind the Grenadier Guards. It was a whole regiment, all in full regalia, marching down the middle of the road, and the taxi was just behind them at a walking pace. I was in the taxi with her. It was hilarious. We laughed because it was like they were escorting her. And then she started working on the soldiers. "Right side's very bad," she said. Exhausted. Amazing. Put that in the book as well.

There were some yogis who had this idea that Marble Arch used to be the Garden of Eden. Don't ask me why. I mentioned it to Shri Mataji as we drove around it, and she said, "Really?" You can imagine it, can't you? There were a lot of strange ideas. Actually, I think they used to hang people there. Tyburn, wasn't it? Tyburn. Cromwell.

But we had Selfridges. Mother went to Selfridges quite a lot. In fact, at one stage, she had loads of Sahaja Yogis working in there. We had a meeting there as well. John Watkinson worked in there, Dawn worked in there. There was a whole gang of them all together. At an earlier stage, she had a whole load of us working in Harrods.

It was when Mother had Ashley Gardens. She said to Pat, "Pat, you must get a job there." And Pat looked sort of... he'd just got this amazing job as a props man in the BBC on TV, setting up sets and everything, and he was really chuffed. And Shri Mataji said, "No, that's not a suitable job for you. It's like being a porter. Pat, yes, you must get a job in Harrods." Mother turned to me and said, "Yes, you should too." And my face dropped. We both ended up in there. I was working in the bakery department. She was in the flour shop.

As a matter of interest, I used to work at that hotel there. While I was working there, there was an explosion. It was a Libyan. What happened was... you see this here, that place is the Mount Crawford. I worked there. One of the first jobs I got after getting self-realisation was that I worked there. Anyway, one morning, I came in and there was a problem getting in because this is the Mount Royal Hotel.

What happened is, this guy had come in the previous night, and he said he wanted an inside room. You mean no windows? He wanted an inside room because the place is built like a figure of eight with corridors going through, so you've got inside and outside rooms. He said he wanted an inside room, and because of the way the place was filling up, he could only get one on the next floor. And he was the only one there. Later on in the night, a couple more people came to a room near where he was.

So what happened was, he was building a bomb to take them out. And one of them blew up. It killed him and made a mess and sort of blew out the room, and most of the window was on the inside. But as luck would have it, he was the only one on that floor and he was the only one that was killed. There was another person in a room nearby who had a slight concussion. So it was quite major. I'd like to think it was because of Mother sort of looking after me. It could be. If it had been an outside room, it could have been quite devastating because there could have been a lot of other people involved.

Bramham Gardens... 19 Bramham. It was a hotel just off Earl's Court, more or less opposite Earl's Court Station. That's the next hotel. Mio is the guy to talk to about Bramham Gardens, because Robert knocked on the door, didn't he? He lived there for about three months. We were all living in Warwick Road, which was in the next road, just nearby. Mother stayed there. I don't think Sir C.P. stayed there. He probably did, but he was probably out at work most of the time. He was often off on trips.

There was also that place out... somewhere near Hounslow. Sutton Court Road or something. That sounds familiar. They had two houses together. We had a big garden out there where we did a couple of pujas. There was a place near Hounslow Heath. It was yet another one of our housing co-op places, an empty place. It was the place where everyone got food poisoning.

Whereabouts do you say it was? I can't remember where it was. All I know is it was somewhere near where James used to live. Surbiton. Ah, Surbiton. It could be Surbiton, yes. It was a Surbiton place. This was where our van ran out of petrol on the night of my marriage. We had our first argument because I refused to get out of the car wearing my turban.

We were all living around here when we met Mother. I was living behind Madame Tussauds. Cornwall Terrace, that's where we were. It's behind there; it overlooks the park.

We can go to Judd Street. It's near North Gower Street. This is it, North Gower Street. It was a bit farther down, wasn't it? On the right. Where that entrance to Tolmers Square is, it's more or less opposite there. It was an old bank. That bank on the corner that was closed.

Mokshind Shah, that's right. The yoga playboy. I think it was a rather good name because it described him to a T. Well, he was the one who told us about Shri Mataji. And do you know who told him to come to England? The Sathya Sai Baba. Oh well. That works in mysterious ways. It certainly does. We all lived around here before we met Shri Mataji. There were all these streets where we hung out a lot. Ambala Sweetshop. Lovely.

So when we had puja with Mother, we would come to Ambala and buy one box of Indian sweets. We now know they were called Burfi and Laddu. There'd be a variety of pistachios and others... we didn't know. It was like food of the gods. Have a little piece of this vibrated Indian sweet.

We all lived in this area before I met Shri Mataji. It was a large squatting community. I remember the second or third time I met Shri Mataji, which was just around the corner in North Gower Street. She was on her own. Gregoire was with her, and that was about all, with a whole room full of hippies all arguing about drugs. And at one point, she just sort of hugged herself and went, "What can I do?" I just thought she was like a mother with all these naughty children. So I just said, "Okay, I'll stop, see what happens." Taking drugs. I got a lot of dirty looks from all the others, but it was amazing how courageous she was. Coming from her background, the level of society she lived on, into a room... they were a very wild bunch around here. They really were. She just took on the whole room. It was quite amazing.

This is a point I was making when I said earlier that it sort of germinated, and then when it went to Judd Street, it started to take root. Then when it got to North Gower Street, it had a permanent place and started to grow. And then when it got to Caxton Hall, it started to spread. So it was like a flower.

We had a fair few weeds around here as well, didn't we? Mother said in one of her talks that all the rubbish went into the foundations. But what you've got to remember is even if the rubbish goes into the foundations, it makes the foundation stronger so it can support the whole building. So even those that got passed aside would have done their bit in a way. Every little helps.

So why do you think people in those early days, some of them just didn't stick on? The penny didn't drop. They might have known, but they weren't prepared to believe. Or they were so into other things. There was peer pressure as well. It just seemed like another experience. I got quite a lot of stick about stopping taking drugs. People were very cynical by then. You go out, you go to a couple of parties, get a bit wasted, and you lose all the vibrations and see it all differently. It happened to me. I didn't make it the second week. I meant to, but I didn't. And Shri Mataji asked after me, because Maureen went. She came back and said, "Oh, Shri Mataji asked where you were." And I was quite touched. Sweet of her to remember.

There was this battle between good and evil. There were false gurus out there everywhere, and people were getting skeptical. The young people were totally skeptical by then. That was the whole beginning of this Aquarian thing, that the seekers tried to go it alone after they started to get disillusioned with the big heavyweight gurus.

They were rough. I remember that speed freak who threw the brick through the window. The brick came right through the window. We were all sitting there with Shri Mataji, and this brick came flying through the window. And Shri Mataji said, "Look, did you see the way it moved?" It didn't hit anyone. It actually came straight through the window and then went like that, so it changed its trajectory. Anyway, I knew who it was because he was shouting outside. So I leaped up in a fury and went pounding down the stairs to catch him and wring his neck. Afterwards, they told me she must have been putting bandhans on me so that I wouldn't find him and he wouldn't get hurt.

They were a pretty wild bunch. I vaguely remember at that time Mother saying something like, "Don't worry. When I go, I shall pull in my net." A lot of them were good people, some of them were nice. They got lost again. But, you know, who knows? There were a lot of them around here, that was for sure. Quite a lot of them were middle-class, educated people. Christine came from a good background, a very good family. But they just unfortunately got lost again. It's sad. Also, you were going to give up a lot of fun. It was like one big permanent party around here, it just never stopped.

Did she actually say anything about coming from this decadence of the Western '60s and '70s? Oh, yeah. Every time she met someone. She'd talk to each one and find out what they'd been doing and what their background was, probing them, trying to find out what condition they were in. And she'd always be horrified. She'd just say she couldn't believe so many people had become so damaged so young or had been through so much suffering so young. She meant suffering in a spiritual sense—just lost and frustrated and that kind of thing. They were all a heavy, heavy bunch. Remember that guy we used to call the Incredible Hulk? He used to sit in the back of the room going, "Ho, ho, ho! What universe are we in today? Ho, ho, ho!"
