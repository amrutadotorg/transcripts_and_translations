It gives me great pleasure to introduce Shri Mataji.

I feel very sincere with you all. Thank you. Thank you.

Introducer: We just talked about the chakras and then some experiences on the Nabhi. I talked about the system itself, the chakras in general, the right and left side, and then some experiences of the Nabhi, the center heart, and so on.

Shri Mataji: Finished?

Introducer: She's finished, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Thank you.

I should stand up because it's better. I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the very outset, we have to know that truth is what it is. We cannot conceptualize it, we cannot order it, we cannot organize it. It is what it is. The only thing is that the human awareness that we have today has to rise to the level of the truth and be felt on your central nervous system.

First and foremost is that you cannot pay for it because this happens through the living process of a living energy. And you cannot pay for anything that is living. For example, you see these flowers—the miracle—and you see a seed sprouting from the Mother Earth. We don't pay anything to the Mother Earth. It's the capacity of the Mother Earth that sprouts it. So, whatever Dr. Bhagdaan has told you about has to be seen with the open mind of a scientist. You should not deny it, nor should you accept it blindfolded. You have to have the experience on your central nervous system.

And that's the word we call Gna. In the Sanskrit language, gna means to know on your central nervous system. Or we can call it Veda—from where the word Veda has come—that you have to know on your central nervous system. If the truth has to be known on our central nervous system, it is through all our evolutionary processes that we become human beings. We know the truth through our central nervous system. For example, you can see a white thing spread here, and you see a little gold there. You see it. It's there, and you can see the beauty of it also.

But supposing there's an animal, a dog or a horse. If you want a horse or a dog to go through a dirty lane, it can go. It has no problems. For a human being, it's a big problem because the human being can feel the filth and the dirt. This evolution has taken place within human beings by which we are better off than them. But a little more has to be done. The reason for that is that we do not know the absolute truth. It's on your central nervous system that this is the truth and nothing but the truth.

Now, it is said that there is an all-pervading power which does all these miraculous things. We just take it for granted. Imagine, the flowers are all of different varieties, but they grow on different bushes and different trees. Who does the choice? Who works out these miraculous colors? And how do they come every season and disappear every season? Who is doing all these wonderful things which are living?

Even in medical science, you know that anything that goes into the body which is a foreign thing is thrown out. The system of the body is such that it has to throw it out. But when a mother conceives a child, it's not thrown out. It is preserved, nourished, looked after, and then at the right time, it is thrown out. Who does that? There are many things in medical science which people could not understand, but they have been honest about it to say that they don't know. They don't know why it happened.

Then, when they say there is an autonomous nervous system, as the doctor must have told you, which works out our left and right sympathetic nervous system and the central parasympathetic nervous system. These three systems work through "auto." Now, who is this "auto"? You are sitting there. So who is this one within us? Who digests the food? Who does all the work inside the body? What is that power?

So, to understand this living power, we have to jump a little higher than human awareness. We can call that our redemption, you can call it a second birth, Self-knowledge—whatever you want to call it. But the thing is that human awareness at this level cannot tell you the absolute truth. And for getting to that position of that awareness, you don't have to do anything. What did we do to become human beings? Nothing. We just became human beings. In the same way, to become a superhuman being also, we don't have to do anything.

Some people think you have to stand on your heads. I mean, it's something I can't understand. Why should you stand on your head? They say that by doing that, this force that is called Kundalini, which is within us, may move. It doesn't move that way. It hasn't got a problem of gravity. It is not something which we can hold on to. What is it that we are talking about? What we have to put our attention to is, what have we gained out of it? What is the gain in our awareness?

You must have heard about Carl Jung. Today only, I happened to read a nice article written about him by one of your editors, that he said what we need is redemption, Self-realization, as Carl Jung has described. And that is what is going to happen to you. It's very simple; it works out.

I must say and also apologize that I came to Miami very late. Last year, I was going to Bogota, and on my way back, I came to the Miami airport and I just felt there were lots of seekers here. So I asked Patrick, "Can you move on to Miami?" And he got a fright of his life. He said, "Mother, there are no seekers, there are all money seekers, where are you sending me?" I said, "Just try. I have a feeling there are lots of seekers in Miami and it is going to work out." And by God's grace, now we have so many people here that are seeking the truth.

Most of our troubles and diseases come to us because there is an imbalance within us. We go to extremes. That's human nature; he doesn't know how to balance himself. It's only after Self-realization he realizes that there has to be a balance. Now you have an ecological problem, you have a drug problem, you have other horrible diseases, family problems, society problems. In politics there is a problem. Who has created the problems? These are all created by human beings. If human beings could develop their balance and their collective understanding of the whole thing, the collective responsibility, it will all disappear.

So you have to become collectively conscious. This means you have to feel your own centers, your own being inside, and also you have to feel the centers of others. So who is the other? Supposing there is a problem with this hand. Then this hand will immediately come to help it. It doesn't think, because it's part and parcel of the whole. So this idea of the microcosm becoming the macrocosm has been working. People are talking about it, but somehow they did not know how to do it.

I also was born with a special knowledge about the divine power, I must confess. I knew all about it, but I just thought, "How am I to talk to people?" And my father, who was also a realized soul, told me, "Don't talk about it anymore, because it will become another Bible or Gita or something, and people will start reading and be satisfied with it." So by reading, nothing is going to work out; they have to get the experience. So I worked on many people in a very subtle way and I found out a method. In the year 1970, when I was quite old at that time—I was about 47 years of age—I found out the method. And by that method, I knew I could arrange the realization.

And it worked. It started with one lady only, but it worked. And now Sahaja Yoga is working in 30 nations. Not only that, but in India, the Delhi University has taken it up as research, and there are three people who have got their M.D. on their research on physical ability, on epilepsy, and the third subject they have handled is psychosomatic diseases.

Now, you don't cure anyone, that's the point. You don't cure anybody, but you get cured by your own power. It's all your own. Just like one enlightened candle can enlighten another candle without putting any pressure or taking any obligations, in the same way it works. Now, all those people whom you see here as Sahaja Yogis can all give realization. They know all about it, the complete knowledge, and they haven't paid a single pie for that. Of course, for this hall they must have paid; they must have gathered money, I'm sure. Formerly, in the beginning, I used to pay for all of them, but now they think it is beyond their self-respect that I should pay. So that much money they must have gathered or they must have been supplied by some other centers from America and abroad, but I don't know anything about it.

Now, your understanding should be that you have to have the meaning of your life. This instrument is here, but if it is not put to the mains, it has no meaning. Why you are on this earth, what you have to do, and how you are going to enjoy yourself—for all these questions, first you have to be connected, yoga, with the divine power. And this is the only thing that has to happen.

It is the power of pure desire. And this power of pure desire is the one that just gets awakened, pierces through your fontanel bone area, and you feel the cool breeze coming out of it. Christ has said that you are to be born again, but not through artificial baptism where somebody puts water on you and says, "All right, now you are baptized." We accept, absolutely. I am from a Christian family, and I was also cursed the same way. But one has to know that just to belong to any religion doesn't give you any help. You may be a Christian, you may be a Hindu, you may be a Muslim, you may be anything—you can commit any sin. You can be the most unrighteous person, you can belong to the mafia, you can belong to the murderous class, but still you can go to church, you can go to temples, and you can go to mosques. Nobody minds it. It's all right as long as you pay.

So that's not religion. Religion is a valency within human beings which resides in the stomach. There we have ten valencies, and those ten valencies are described in our Ten Commandments in the Bible, and in many religions it has been described. So when these are awakened within us, we really become saints in the sense that we just don't want to do something that's not all right. Like I said, you cannot pass through the dirty lane. In the same way, you just don't want to do sinful things; you just don't do it. And you become so powerful yourself that nothing can dominate you. No habits, nothing can dominate you. But at the same time, you are very compassionate and very loving and also knowledgeable.

If you love someone, you know something. But on a divine level, it is the divine power which loves and informs you about everything, and you start acting like a divine computer. If you put your hands towards someone—even small children, if they are realized souls—if you take ten children, tie up their eyes, and ask them, "What's wrong with this fellow?" immediately they'll point out the finger. And this finger, if you can decode what it means, then you know what he is suffering from. And then if you know how to correct it, you can correct yourself and you can correct others.

We have to change the world. But changing the world doesn't mean you change the map of the world. No. You have to change human beings, and change them in the sense that they have to get this power flowing into their being so that they get transformed into beautiful people. In India, supposing, in a village, if you take a television and tell them, "Oh, this is something so miraculous that if you put it to the mains, you will start seeing pictures and things," they'll say you are telling lies, that it's just a story. "How can it be? This is just a box." But this human box, when put to the mains, you are amazed how glorious it is, how great it is, how wonderful it is. We have lost that understanding, perhaps, that we are worth such a lot. That worth has to be discovered through our powers emitting. And once you feel those powers emitting through you, you'll be amazed at how much you can achieve in life. The life becomes an ocean of joy, and you want to distribute this joy to everyone. The whole thing changes in your temperament.

You don't have to run away from your house. You don't have to run away from your duties, nothing of the kind. As you know, I'm a grandmother and I have my children. My husband is in a job which is a very different type, and I have to lead a double life. But it doesn't matter. It's all right because I'm there. Whatever you are doing, you become so dynamic. You're never tired. And at the same time, you are extremely relaxed and peaceful. Your eyes become so innocent, and even a glance of such a person can bring great peace, curing, and also tremendous joy. The personality changes. It's so beautiful.

Now, it looks very fantastic to people in these modern times. How can it be? How can it work out? But it does. It works out everywhere else, and I'm sure it will work out in Miami also. I would say that to talk about it, I must have given at least three to four thousand lectures only in the English language, and I don't know how many in other languages. But now, there are so many lights here. You see them. And if I have to say, "All right, we have to put on the lights," you just switch on one switch and they are all on because it's all built-in. In the same way, it's all built-in within us, and just a switch has to be put on. But supposing I start telling you who discovered electricity, the history of electricity, then how it was brought to Miami, and how it was installed—you will get a headache. So the best thing is to have your light and see for yourself, your own experience.

No amount of discussion and argument is going to work it out. It has to work out. And if it has to work out, let it work out. Supposing, as I told you, if you have to do any living work, like sowing a seed, you don't argue with the Mother Earth. You just put it there. It's done. In the same way, it's very simple and it's very glorious. I bless you all and I would request you to ask me some questions. This is the only day I'm here, and I don't want you to linger with your questions later on when you go. So if you have any relevant questions, please ask me. I have not come here to take anything from you; I have just come here to give what you have. So if you can ask relevant questions, I'll be very thankful to you and I'll try my level best to answer them.

Audience Member: [Inaudible comment about Jesus Christ]

Shri Mataji: Now this gentleman is talking about Jesus Christ, asking where Jesus Christ is within us. He is the path and He is the gate. We too believe the same thing, but what we believe in is a reality, not just talk. It's a reality. You have to know Christ within yourself, where He is and how He acts. He resides in this portion which is crossing as the optic chiasma. And once He's awakened, He sucks in these two pouches which are on the sides, which is why we say that He died for our sins. These are two pouches, as he must have told you: one is our conditioning and another is our ego. Unless and until He's awakened within us, this doesn't happen.

But artificially, if anybody says, "I belong to Jesus," Jesus has already said it in the second chapter of Matthew, in the second verse, that "you'll be calling me 'Jesus, Jesus,' but I will not know you." This is because just calling "Jesus, Jesus" is not the same. You don't know how to awaken Jesus within you. We do use it. You'll be amazed that we have Jews now who believe in Jesus, not only believe but respect Him and worship Him, because we have shown them that Jesus is a part and parcel of our being. Without Him, we cannot get our realization. But just talking big about Jesus, making money in the name of Jesus, that's what all the organizations are doing. That's not the way. How much money did Christ take? He was sold for 30 pieces of silver. We are doing the same. When He took a big hunter and hit the people, they are the same people today, taking the name of Jesus, using Him and selling Him in the market. They can't talk of Jesus. They have no right. They are unauthorized.

Audience Member: When we study this, why is it that religion is always brought in? I think it's the downfall of the whole movement. Can't we believe that there is a creator, something up there? Why must we name Him?

Shri Mataji: You see, the trouble is in the name of religion. Religion is very important. You don't know, all these great prophets and the great incarnations who came on this earth were born on the same tree of life. They were all flowers. Like Mohammed Sahib has said—you'll be amazed, we know what Mohammed is—He said that at the time of Qiyamah, at the time of resurrection, your hands will speak. Clearly. He has written a full chapter on it. But when we think we belong to this, it's like a blinker on our eyes; we don't want to see, and then we become fanatics. I think any fanatic is the same as Ayatollah Khomeini; there's no difference.

So if you can get out of that idea, you have to be innately religious, belong to the pure religion of your being. Then you belong to all the religions because you really follow them. Otherwise, you don't follow them. It's just a Sunday morning prayer, that's all. When you get your Self-realization, then you become really religious. You cannot do an irreligious thing. You just can't do it. I don't have to tell you to go and read about the Ten Commandments. You just know it. It's like this: supposing you are carrying a snake in your hand in the darkness and I tell you there's a snake in your hand. You'll never believe me. You'll say, "No, how do you say? This is a rope." So the best thing is to put the light on so you see the snake and you just drop it.

So there's no taboo in discussing anything because we have to face the reality. It is that all these people who came on this earth came to teach us balance and to teach us that we have to have our realization. The essence of all the religions, if you take it, is only one: seek the eternal. The essence of all the religions is that the eternal is to be sought, and the transitory is to be treated in its own limitations. But according to the timings, it changed. It had to be changed. Today is the time for me to give you Self-realization. That's all my job is. But if I have to explain, I can explain all of them because I know what they are and what work they have done. I do not disregard anyone or discard anyone. They have been very great and they are all on our central nervous system. They have done the work for us, so how can you discard them when you know the truth?

So as far as religion is concerned, we are not discussing the outside religion. Because we know in every religion—in Sikhism, Hinduism, every "ism" is horrible and they have brought shame to everyone. For example, take Hinduism. In the Gita, Shri Krishna has said that in every soul resides the Spirit. Then how can you have a caste system? Aptitude may be a caste. Like some of you who are seekers are called Brahmins. Some who are seekers of money are called Vaishyas. Some who are seekers of power are called Kshatriyas. That's a different thing; that's an aptitude, and that's what exactly it was. But now it's changed over. Now you are born as something. How can you be born? So one has to understand the universal nature of religion. We are all one. Maybe you are born in America, I was born in India—it doesn't matter. We are all one, and that is to be realized. It is not to be just said that we are one, and then tomorrow a war breaks out and we start breaking each other's necks. It's not that way. It is really within yourself that you can feel it, the collective consciousness. In Sahaja Yoga, Christ is so helpful to us every moment. All of them are very helpful because we are doing genuine work. Is there any other question? I think you all are in silence.

Audience Member: [Question about her work before 1970]

Shri Mataji: That was before I started the work. On a subtle level, I had to study why we can't have our mass realization. That was my mission in life. To create a method, to study the permutations and combinations. What's wrong with human beings? What chakras are troubling them? In what country what's the problem? And how to work it out? It's a process by which I could find out that human beings have only a few problems, and if I could somehow manage them, it can be worked out.

Audience Member: Can you work it out?

Shri Mataji: A candle has to be enlightened to enlighten another candle, isn't it? That's the point. An unenlightened candle cannot do it. Do you follow my point now? People think that mass realization is a difficult thing. It cannot be. As you know about electricity, it was developed by one person, but it had to be used by the public, otherwise it has no meaning. In the same way, this time has been already prophesied and this work has to take place. And what I worked out is a subtle method of developing the permutations and combinations of different persons, what's the matter with them. And then I started it in the year 1970. When you get your realization, if you are an enlightened light, you can enlighten another person without any obligation.

Audience Member: [Question about her being different]

Shri Mataji: No, no. I was a born realized soul. I was a person who had already felt this; I knew about all these things, this knowledge. I was born with it. But to share it with others... Dr. Bagdan has knowledge now, but I was born with this knowledge. And I had to share it with others. This new awareness, you cannot just share it. So I had to develop a method of making people come up to that position, and then they can feel it.

In India, we understand this because the Western life is something like the tree growing outside, and the Eastern life is the roots growing inside. They have found out the roots. This big tree cannot be sustained without them. But they are related to each other. It's very important. So this is the knowledge of the roots, I can say, but it has to be available for everyone. As we know science from you, you have to know this divine science from us. It makes no difference.

Audience Member: So why do you think it is that people who are trying to become more spiritual or more enlightened are a minority? I think it's very frustrating sometimes when there are so many people out there, or maybe just more in the Western world, that are so against it, that are so much more growing on the outside...

Shri Mataji: I don't know why Western people are this way. But when I first came to America, I must tell you, they told me, "Unless and until you charge them money, they will not come to you." Really. And it's still there. It's still just the same. I went to Vancouver, and there was a lady called Guru Mai who had come there. She was charging three hundred Canadian dollars for every meeting. She had two meetings and she bagged about 1.6 million in two days. She has just laser beams and a big show and she said some Sanskrit verses, that's all. Finished. And people just got mesmerized. Two people from that came to me. She had about two thousand people; I had about five hundred. And out of those, two had been to her, and they said, "We've gone crazy now." I said, "Why?" They said, "We paid her six hundred dollars each for two days, and we are feeling like crazy people." So we had to make them sit down and put them right, and then they started feeling normal. As a result of that, in the follow-on, many people came because they were shocked at what this lady was doing. They like all that. What to do?

Even in England, I was there for so many years. My husband has been there. A gentleman from the BBC came to ask me funny questions. I put him right, but then ultimately, he says, "We can't understand anything without money." I said, "Why?" He says, "The Anglo-Saxon brain cannot understand anything without money." I said, "Is it a special brain God has made?" But on the contrary, in India, say, if I go to Bombay, even in a city like Bombay which is very materialistic, last time I had about twelve thousand people. In Delhi, I had fifteen thousand. India is different. They know what a real saint is. This kind of a show—laser beams, this, that—I don't know. Anybody can do it. What's so great? As you said, it's true, but I think wisdom will come gradually. Yes, true. There's a minority of people, agreed, very much so. And sometimes it's very disappointing. People get so frustrated and they say, "Mother, just don't worry about America, don't worry about England." I say, "No, I have to worry, whatever it is."

Audience Member: People think you're crazy when you come out with the truth this way. Most people, when you try to talk to them, they don't believe it, they think you're crazy.

Shri Mataji: All right, but if I'm fake, then why would I be fake? For what reason? Use your intelligence. If I'm charging you money, asking for any obligation, nothing. So why should I be fake? By God's grace, my husband is very highly placed. I come from a very rich family myself, from my husband's side and my father's side. I'm from a royal family. So if I have to be fake, why should I be?

Audience Member: I didn't mean you.

Shri Mataji: No, no, I agree with you. But what I'm saying is this: those who are really fake, people cling to that fellow. There was one fourteen-year-old fellow who came here. He was permanently fourteen years old. Now he has disappeared as a Yankee, married some American lady, and he's very wise because he said, "Better have the money with you." But Rajneesh, you see how he was thrown out. So what I'm trying to tell you is that they cling more to the fake person. This is what I'm saying. They have more attachment because fake people try all kinds of ways and methods of doing things. They know how to advertise, they know how to attract people. This is what it is. If they cared for reality, they should come to something that is real. I agree with you very much, but they go to fake people more.

Audience Member: Because they're skeptical, they don't believe something is given to them for nothing.

Shri Mataji: But what can one pay for this? If we use our reason, what did we pay to any one of these great people who came on this earth? Did we? Nothing. Except for torturing them, crucifying them, giving them poisons. Imagine, Christ had only twelve disciples. Just think of it, the minority part of it. Buddha had really two disciples, in a real sense of the word.

Audience Member: Shri Mataji, we're talking about this, but are we going to be able to get this Self-realization? She's anxious.

Shri Mataji: All right. I think everybody seems to be anxious about it. I agree with her. Some people have certain doubts, which I can read. One of them is, can we get it at any age? We are very old or something. You can get it at any age. Yes, everybody will get it. That's what I'm going to work out. Now, still there are two people. Yes, sir?

Audience Member: How is it possible for one person to give another person life?

Shri Mataji: I told you just now. It is there. You just see for yourself; you yourself will start giving it. And then I'll ask you, how did you manage? All right.

Audience Member: Why don't you make it easy for everyone? Why don't you create a council? In America we need instant gratification.

Shri Mataji: I wish I could do it that way. I wish I could. But even for that, we'll have a minority. You see, people don't seek reality in life, I tell you. In Sahaja Yoga, even if you get your realization, you won't be satisfied unless and until you have really become a master. Like the connection, if it is loose, you don't feel happy. You say, "Mother, make the connection perfect." And you do it automatically. You don't have to pay for it or anything. But I can't understand why for anything fake, they go very fast.

Have you read a book written by H.G. Wells called Tono-Bungay? I don't know if you could have read it; it's an ancient book, and I come from an ancient time, so I read it in my childhood. I was amazed. This man could not make any money, so he decided to make a medicine called Tono-Bungay. What a name it was. His wife was against it. She said, "You are going to deceive people." He said, "It's all right. We'll make money." So he made a medicine which was all absurd and advertised it. Thousands and thousands started buying it. The wife was so upset, and she didn't know what to do, and there was a big fight over it. Then she suddenly died, and this man became really mad. This is what it is. I mean, the story is, of course, H.G. Wells being a very benevolent writer, he sees to the benevolence of people, so he brought forth the benevolence of people. But he didn't know how people take to artificial things and to all kinds of advertisement. They have all tried to point it out to us, but how far we learn from them depends on our own depth.

People don't have depth. You have to have depth. That is important, the depth of seeking. If you have the depth of your seeking, you want to have it. Now there are many who have been to wrong gurus, have been harmed by them, troubled by them, and sickened by them. But they had such an earnest desire that when they came to Sahaja Yoga, they got it, despite all the problems they had and the amount of money they had spent. They had become so poor, but they got it because they were earnestly seeking that truth. So if there is that depth, it works. But if there is no depth, then you run after a person who gives you a diamond or some sort of a miracle or some materialization or something like that. So it also depends on the depth of people.

Gradually it is coming up. When I came here in 1972, I told them about AIDS, that it's coming. And they didn't like it. They didn't like it at all. But when it came, they telephoned me that, "We are in it, Mother. Now what can we do?" I said, "What can you do? Try Sahaja Yoga." And with Sahaja Yoga, you have to have willpower, and they have no willpower. It's a big problem. So even if you tell them, even if you prophesize... Like parapsychology, I went to San Diego. They invited me. It was so embarrassing. I didn't know what parapsychology was; I thought it was above psychology. But it was all dealing with spirits. I was surprised. I said, "How could they teach such a thing?" I said, "I am sorry you have invited me, but I must tell you the truth." And I told them, "This is horrid." And when I went back to San Diego, what I found was that the whole foundation of parapsychology was finished. The lady who was in charge has become mad. Her husband died of cancer. And so many of the members got so many diseases and died. So at least, if you are following someone, your health should be all right. I am your mother, supposing. I'll say, "All right, you are following such-and-such guru. What about your health? Is it all right or not?" At least the minimum of minimums. You have paid so much money to this fellow, and your health is not all right. What's the use of retaining such a guru? They are all parasites. You must know they are parasites. How can you purchase them? And they don't like me because they can't purchase me.

Audience Member: What do you get out of it?

Shri Mataji: What does he say?

Audience: What do you get out of it?

Shri Mataji: Son, we get love. What else do you want? Tell me. The one who gets love in this world, he doesn't want anything else. God has given you everything. When you love others, you will come to know that there is nothing more to be achieved than this.

An audience member asks in Hindi, "Why do you do all this? What do you get?"

Shri Mataji, replying in Hindi, then translating: She asked me in the Indian language, "Mother, why do you do all these things? What do you get out of it?" I said, "I get love and I get fulfillment of my life." I said, when you will also give realization to people, you'll also get that satisfaction. The greatest satisfaction is to love someone and to enjoy this Divine love and its work, to see the miracles of the Divine. It's the greatest thing.

Audience Member: I just want to ask a jumble of questions, I think. I feel that one God serves everyone, whether you're Jewish, Christian, Muslim, Hindu, black, white, whatever. Part of my family is Jewish, part of my family is Christian. I have a stepson that's Jewish. He's married a Christian... Am I so wrong to feel that there's one God for everybody and you don't have to name it Jesus and you don't have to name it...?

Shri Mataji: And this is what I say, you don't have to name it anything. It's human nature, isn't it? Because now you call this a rose, we call it a gulab. Doesn't matter. Makes no difference. There's only one ocean which touches many shores. It's like that. It's an ocean.

Audience Member: If we meditate and this happens, will there be a physical change in the body?

Shri Mataji: Very much. If you have any trouble, any physical problem, it gets cured. Then also you develop a kind of a glow on your face, and your eyes also have a sparkle. And you become very resistant to diseases and to trouble. Once you get realization, you cannot get any disease like AIDS and all that. That's out of the question. And you don't go to doctors either. Everything improves very much. Now, can you believe, I'm sixty-seven years of age and every day I'm traveling, giving a lecture. Today I'm with you, tomorrow I'll be in Bogota. And Bogota is tremendous, I must tell you, they're in the thousands.

Audience Member: What language are you going to speak there?

Shri Mataji: No, they translate it. Somebody translates it, yes.

Audience Member: Do you have to do it at a certain time of the day or every day at the same time?

Shri Mataji: Not at all. There's nothing binding. Actually, you are in meditation. You are in meditation. You only have to see for yourself if you are getting the connection all right or not. Are you feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, as we call it? The Holy Ghost is the power of God, and that is what is reflected within us as Kundalini. So you feel the cool breeze on your fingertips, a very soothing cool breeze which soothes you down. You have to just see that you're feeling it, that's all. It's a very short time; we can say ten minutes at the most in the evening before sleeping and about five minutes in the morning. It's perfectly all right. Not much time is needed. But to get yourself fixed up, to get it properly fixed, you might need a little more time and you have to come to the collective, to where they have the program. You have to come, that's all, and you become a master. You yourself can start a center.

Audience Member: When you meditate, do I have to make a prayer? What do you do? You just sit there and that's it?

Shri Mataji: That's it. You said it. That's American style. That's it.

Audience Member: Could we have the experience now?

Shri Mataji: All right. Now let's have it, all right? Because I want you to ask the questions, because sometimes while doing this the questions just stand up in your heads and your attention gets diverted. So now we know that there's nothing to be asked about. It has to work out. It has to work. We have to have the desire that it should work out.

There are two conditions. One condition is that you should not feel guilty at all. Forget the past. Come to the present. There's a fashion also to feel guilty. Some people do genuinely feel guilty, but one must know that we are human beings. If you have made mistakes or if you have done something that was wrong, after all, you are human beings. You are not God. So everything can be forgiven as long as we don't feel guilty. But if you are sticking to this, that you are feeling guilty... I know it's very difficult. Even if I tell you ten times, when they come and meet me and shake hands, I find again this center here is badly caught up because you are feeling guilty. For this or that. Somebody told me, "I'm feeling guilty for what is happening in Afghanistan." I said, "How are you concerned? You can't do anything. You better not feel guilty." We shouldn't try to put our stupid guilt, which has no meaning, to stop our ascent. This is one condition.

The second condition is that we should forgive everyone. That's what Christ has said. Now, in that also, people say, "That's very difficult, Mother, to forgive." But logically, if you think about it, what do we do if we forgive or we don't forgive? We don't do anything. But if you don't forgive, then you play into the wrong hands because you are doing exactly what the person who has harmed you wants you to do, which is to suffer. So I mean, it's really stupid, isn't it? Why not forgive once for all and get rid of the headache? Just forgive. And once you forgive, you'll feel very much relieved and it will be very good for us because this center of Christ opens out if you forgive. So just forgive yourself and forgive others entirely. Please try to do that. These are the two conditions we have.

We are going to enter into the Kingdom of God. This is the time of our resurrection, and we have no business to judge ourselves. The Kundalini will judge and she will know because she is your Mother and she knows you very well. She knows you for ages, and she knows how to give you your second birth. So you just don't take any responsibility about yourself. Just forget it and get your realization.

Now, we have to understand the centers we'll be working on, on our left side. The left hand is symbolic of a desire to get Self-realization, so we have to put the left hand towards me like this or on your lap. You have to be comfortably seated, and the best thing would be to take out your shoes. Also, we can take help from the Mother Earth if you take out your shoes.

So, at the outset, the two conditions are that we are going to forgive everyone and we are not going to feel guilty at all for whatever we have done. Supposing you were guilty, you would be in jail; you would not have been here. All right. Please put your left hand towards me and both feet on the Mother Earth, separate, because they are two powers within us, left and right. You have to use the right hand to give help to your centers, which we'll do one by one. This will take at the most ten minutes.

Now, we have to close our eyes. Please don't open your eyes until I tell you, because your attention has to move inside. It will take about five minutes more for the whole thing, so please be patient with yourself.

Please put your left hand towards me and your right hand on your heart. Here, in your heart, you have to ask a question to me. You can simply call me Mother. Ask this question three times: "Mother, am I the Spirit?"

Now, you are your own master also. So please put your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and here ask another question: "Mother, am I my own master? Mother, am I my own guide?" I have to respect your freedom because you are going to your ultimate freedom, so it cannot be forced.

Now please put your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen and ask me—you have to ask—"Mother, please give me my Self-realization. I want it." Or, "May I have my Self-realization?" Just ask six times. In your own freedom you have to ask six times because this center has got six petals.

As you ask for your pure knowledge, the Kundalini starts moving upward. So now you have to open the higher centers with your self-confidence. Take your right hand to the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and with full confidence in yourself, please say it ten times: "Mother, I am my own master."

Now, the greatest truth about you is that you are not this body, you are not this mind, you are not this intellect, you are not your ego, you are not your conditioning, but you are the pure Spirit. So now raise your hand onto your heart and with full confidence, say it twelve times: "Mother, I am the Spirit."

The Spirit is the ocean of love and compassion. It is the ocean of bliss and joy. But above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness. So whatever mistakes you have committed can be easily dissolved by that powerful ocean. Raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your neck to your right. Here now, with full confidence again, please say it sixteen times: "Mother, I am not guilty at all."

As I have told you, you have to really forgive everyone. You do not do anything when you don't forgive or you forgive. But if you don't forgive, then you play into the wrong hands. So you are not going to miss the chance of your Self-realization. Just say it from your heart by putting your hand on your forehead across and pressing it on both sides, putting down your head. Please put down your head and say here: "Mother, I forgive everyone." Not how many times, but from your heart, please say it. Don't try to remember those whom you have to forgive or what they have done. Just say it in general.

Now, take back your hand, put it on the back side of your head and push back your head. Here you have to say for your own satisfaction, without counting your mistakes, just say, "O Divine, if I have done any mistakes, please forgive me." Say it from your heart.

Now, stretch your hand and put the center of your palm on the soft bone which was in your childhood called the fontanel bone area, and now put down your head. Please put down your head so you can press it better. Push back your fingers—that's very important—and press your scalp seven times, very slowly, clockwise. Here again, I cannot force it on you, so you have to say, "Mother, I want my Self-realization. Mother, please give me my Self-realization." This you have to say in your own freedom seven times, otherwise it cannot be forced onto anyone. So please, in your own freedom and glory, just say that seven times from your heart.

Now, take down your hands. Slowly open your eyes. Now, put the right hand towards me, please put down your head and see for yourself if there's a cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. Sometimes it is a little far away, but don't touch your head. Hold it above your head and see for yourself. Move your hand and see if there's a cool breeze coming out of your head. Sometimes it could be hot air; it doesn't matter. After the hot air, you start feeling the cool breeze.

Now, please put your left hand towards me and check with the right hand if there's a cool breeze coming out of your head. Some people get it like a jet, and some people get something trickling out as a cool breeze. Now, please put your right hand towards me and again feel with your left hand if there's a cool breeze coming out of your head.

Now, please put your left hand up like this and push back your head. Ask any one of these questions three times: "Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?" "Mother, is this the all-pervading power of God's love?" "Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?" Just ask any one of these questions three times.

Now, put down your hands. You'll feel very relaxed, first of all, and there won't be any thought in your mind. Now, please put down your hands. Those who have felt the cool breeze on their fingertips or on their hands or out of their head, either on the hands or out of their head, please raise both your hands.

It's wonderful. So many of you have felt it. May God bless you. I would like to meet all of you, and I'll see why some people have not felt it.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Shri Mataji, to an individual: I told you, I have to work only for forgiveness for everyone. That's the problem with everyone. They don't forgive. Just forgive, please, please, please. Not to feel bad about it. Just forgive. It's a load unnecessarily on your head. So just forgive. All right.

So, we just finished the little thing I was starting: that your attention becomes disconnected from your thoughts, that you realize that this attention is reality and not an abstract thing. When this energy passes through this center at the top, it relaxes the thinking process, and this attention becomes something that you can control without thinking. Or, it happens to you. If this attention is brought to the top of your head, beyond your thinking awareness, we say that you reach a state called thoughtless awareness.

This state, which is called in Sanskrit nirvichara samadhi, is something that in many systems takes lifetimes to reach. You'll just get it tonight in an instant. In this state, where you are not thinking but are fully aware, you know and are alert about anything that's happening around you, but your thinking process is not necessarily in action. That state is the minimum state one has to reach to do meditation.

As I said, it is something very fantastic and described as something very difficult to reach. But fortunately, tonight, we have in front of us somebody very, very special, who can, if you desire it, give you this experience just like that and bring you all into nirvichara samadhi in a split second. This person is Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi. Thank you for listening.

I bow to all the seekers of truth.

At the very outset, we have to know that truth is what it is. We cannot conceptualize it, nor can we organize it. Neither can we order it. So, we have to know it. I know in Finland, I came here in 1980, and I found people were great seekers, no doubt. They were seeking the truth. But at the same time, you have to know that truth is a manifestation on your central nervous system. You have to feel this all-pervading power all around us. You have to feel it on your fingertips. It's not just what one may claim about, but it actually has to happen to you.

From the amoeba stage, we have now come to the human stage. And there's a little breakthrough which we have to achieve in this lifetime. So, how do we do it? Many people ask me, "How do we do it?" Now, how did we become human beings? Spontaneously. Within us is the power which spontaneously acts because it's a living process. It is not an artificial process, but a living process. Just as this Mother Earth sprouts a seed spontaneously, because the Mother Earth has got the capacity, the built-in properties, in the same way, within us is also this built-in instrument.

Now, you have to have an open mind of a scientist, so that you should see for yourself if it works or not. There should not be any blind faith about me or about anything. We have lived with concepts all throughout. Some people believe in this, some people believe in that. So, this belief has led you nowhere. Whatever belief you may have, whatever religion you may follow, whatever philosophies you may follow, every human being is capable of committing any sin.

As we are ourselves, we are miraculous things. Look at the cameras you could ever think of. Look at our brain, what we have created out of it. Look at our hands. All this is a miracle. And look at the flowers. They are so beautiful, coming out of a seed. Who does this work? Who does all the living work? It is done by the all-pervading power, which is a subtle power of God's love. In modern times, if you take the name of God in the West, people don't like it. They also conceptualize by saying, "We don't believe in God." But this is very unscientific. Find out, first of all, if there is God or not. Without finding out any facts, if you say there is no God, then you are unscientific.

Now, if I say that there is God and there is the all-pervading power of God, which does all the subtle work, then, as a scientist, you take it as a hypothesis. And if it is proved, you have to accept it.

As it is a living process, you can't pay for it. Those people who take money from you for doing anything that is called God's work, or increasing your awareness, are all false people. Then, there are some who will say that you can fly in the air. Now, we are flying in the air systematically. But if you just think that some of you just start flying halfway in the air, what will happen? It's not good. Is that what is going to happen to us, that you are going to become birds or what? Then, some people say that you start jumping like a frog. Are we going to become like frogs or earthworms now?

What is going to happen to us is that we are going to become people of absolute truth. Absolutely righteous. Absolutely compassionate. Absolutely loving. Moreover, we are going to have the dynamics of truth. Like Christ, when He saw Mary Magdalene—He had nothing to do with a prostitute—He just looked at her and said, "Those who have not sinned can throw the stone at her." That is the courage. That is the courage of a person who knows the absolute.

While we live in a relative world, we don't know which theory is correct. It's all a mental projection. And nowadays people have become so mental that I don't know how they will recognize the truth. Because the mental projection moves in a linear way. It cannot sustain itself because it's not the truth. We had science, so we produced activity going to the extremes: atom bomb, hydrogen bomb. We started cutting the trees, so the ecological problem has come. We started using machines, and now we have become slaves of machines. Machines are for us, we are not for machines. So, there is no balance in our life. Anything we start, we go to the extremes. And then we feel guilty. We think, "Oh, we have done something wrong." We just start using our ego too much, and then we feel guilty. We should not have done that.

So, the knowledge that you have about science, about all other things, is the knowledge of the tree. But this is the knowledge of your roots. The tree that grows out of proportion, without having a relationship with the roots, is definitely going to be destroyed.

Through Sahaja Yoga—Sahaja means born with you, spontaneous, and Yoga means union with the divine—you can be one with the divine. So, this Sahaja Yoga is a right of every human being. This is the last breakthrough I have told you of our evolutionary process. As a result of that, you get powers. You become powerful. You do not become somebody's slave, but you become your own master. You start feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, which is the all-pervading power. And you get the experience of the actualization of your second birth, which we can say is an actualization of baptism. You feel the cool breeze coming out of your head. You feel it. Then you start understanding your own centers which are within you.

It is like this instrument: if it is not connected to the mains, it has no meaning. In the same way, our lives have no meaning unless and until we are connected to this all-pervading power, which has created us. Of course, as a result of that, so many diseases get cured completely. We have records and records of so many diseases like blood cancer and other incurable diseases being cured. It happens automatically. You yourself become a doctor. You can feel the diseases of another person on your fingertips. And if you know how to connect them, you are a doctor. Mentally, you become so peaceful. You feel such joy and such peace within yourself. In Helsinki there is a big talk of peace; there are peace foundations, but nobody has peace within. So you establish your peace within yourself. Such a person is so compassionate and at the same time so dynamic that you can work any length of time and always be fresh. And you give joy to others.

The first thing that happens to you is that you become an innocent person. And you develop respect for yourself, because you know your glory. You realize you are at the epitome of evolution. You no more feel guilty, because you are now one with that divine power, which is the source of all these things. Your attention becomes so innocent and so powerful. What Christ has said, "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes." Your eyes become completely devoid of lust and greed. And even one glance of such a person can solve the problem of anybody in trouble or distress.

So, this transformation takes place spontaneously. But one has to open the mind and recognize that you are all capable of reaching that state. Also, one thing I've noticed about Finland especially was that people were very simple and very humble. But unnecessarily they felt too much guilt. They have done nothing wrong so far. They have never dominated any country, and I don't know why they are so guilty. To such an extent that they have been frightened also of me. But there is nothing to be afraid of if you are in the collective consciousness, where every nation is your friend. Because you are a part and parcel of the whole. You are not hanging somewhere in the air.

Today, you will be amazed to know that for Helsinki we have got people from very different countries, even from New Zealand. And Sahaja Yoga is now working in thirty nations. You should see the way they all are together. No quarreling, no arguments. Just enjoying each other. More than flowers, more than anything else, the best things to enjoy are human beings. We have to develop that capacity, that state.

I am sorry I am here only for one day. I wish I had come yesterday, and I am very sorry that I could not. The only thing I have to make a humble request to you all is that when you get your realization, don't get lost. I will give you an analogy. Somebody is standing with a snake in his hand, but he is in darkness. And you tell that person, "There is a snake in your hand." So, you put on the light. He sees the light, and then he sees the snake. He is frightened. He throws away the snake, all right, but he also puts out the light because he is frightened. That happens very much. There is nothing to be frightened of. All these things which frighten you will just run away. But you have to stand on your legs.

So far, we have had thousands and thousands of people in the West who have got their realization. They have no problems. Also I would say that in India, when I go there, we have 15,000 people to attend a meeting. We have eternal football crowds. Because we have a background. And the false gurus are not interested in Indians because they don't have so much money to waste. Indians know that you are not to pay anyone who says, "I am such and such." So it works much faster there. But in the West, those Sahaja Yogis we have got are excellent people, very clean. The quantity is less but the quality is great.

I hope today it will work out among you people. And then you are going to master it. This will hardly take a month at the most. But you must have determination that you are going to master this. I'll give you another analogy. When you start driving a car, there is a brake and an accelerator; you use both, like the left and the right sympathetic nervous systems. But once you learn the balancing, you automatically become a driver. But still, the master is sitting behind. Once you become the master, you can see the driver, the accelerator, and the brake. And you control it fully.

All this may sound very fantastic, but you are fantastic. You are not yet aware of it. It's like if you take a television to an Indian village and tell them that you can see everything in this box. They'll say, "What, this box? How can you see everything?" If you show children a box, they will say, "It's just a box." But if you connect it to the mains, then they will see what it really is. So in our ignorance about ourselves, we may not think much about ourselves, but each one of you is capable of achieving that state. So you have to have confidence in yourself. May God bless you all.

You have a lot of knowledge, and I must have given thousands and thousands of lectures, even in the English language. It's like for these beautiful lights, we just have to switch them on. One switch. But if I go on telling all about electricity and how it was stored and how it started in Finland, you will get a headache. The better thing is to have the light.

In any case, because I'm here for one day, if you have any questions, please ask me. But they should be relatively sensible, in the sense that they should show that you want your Self-realization. I'm not here to ask for anything. I'm just going to give you your own property, your own powers. I'm not here for any votes or for any election. I'm sorry I came to Finland very late, but it took some time for me to come here. I must tell you that among all the Scandinavian nations, you are the greatest, I mean spiritually. And don't have any inferiority complex at all. I know Finns very well. Their humility goes up to an inferiority complex. That's way too far. You are good for everything, and especially very good for spiritual ascent. All right. Is there a question?

Question: How can you divide people? Those Scandinavian people, Nordic people, Swedish people. How can you make a divide?

Shri Mataji: Yes, you can also. Once you get this realization, you can also. Because when you go to a nation, you see in spiritual life how many are seeking the Divine, and how some people go deep into it and some people are very superficial. You can easily see that. For example, in Turkey, we had such a lot of Sahaja Yogis suddenly coming up without any difficulties, of all places. And they were the people who were told that they will never come to Sahaja Yoga because they are Islamic people.

Now, as you know, my husband's job is international. I've met many people who are Finns and who are also Swedish and also from Denmark. But I found the Finnish people have a genuine desire to know. So when I say that, I mean the percentage of people. If I say so, Russians will be very great seekers and they will be there very soon. Imagine, their government has accepted Sahaja Yoga officially. And also the Italian government has accepted it in a very big way. I'm not surprised because they know all about it already. So the quality of spirituality can be determined by the percentage of people and the depth of the people. It's easy to ascertain.

Question: If you had some bad habits and you want to try to reach a divine state, do you have to leave them before you go?

Shri Mataji: You just leave them automatically. I don't have to tell you, once you get your realization. In England, we had drug addicts get cured overnight. Overnight. Because you get the light, and you get the power. I know there's a drug problem here, I know that very well. Once you depend on it, and then suddenly you start depending on your Spirit, the whole thing is finished.

Question: How do you practice and how often do you practice this yoga?

Shri Mataji: It's no question of time, my child. You go beyond time. It just works. The Kundalini starts rising and she starts enriching your centers, by which you start feeling better and satisfied with yourself. In most of the cases, it has happened overnight. That's why I say the quality of seeking in the West is much better than in India. Most of the people take drugs because they are seeking. Most of the people who commit suicide, they are also seeking. They do it out of frustration. Also, in Sahaja Yoga, you'll be happy to know that family life becomes beautiful. Every year we have about seventy-five marriages, and I would say one percent end in divorce or some sort of thing, but otherwise they bear very beautiful children, just like saints.

Question: What's the first point about deepening and maintaining the experience, and also the damage?

Shri Mataji: For that, I'm saying you take about a month at the most, because you yourself become knowledgeable. You yourself know what's wrong with you. I'll give you an example. There was a gentleman who came, and he's a realized soul, but he said, "Mother, my Vishuddhi chakra is damaged." That means his ego is troubling him. That means he can see his ego separately. If you tell somebody, "You are suffering from ego," that person will hate you. Now what do I tell him? "You just forgive everyone." And he has those cool vibrations in his hand and he can correct it. So you just have to know how to correct your damages. That's all. Which is, of course, free. The whole knowledge is absolutely free.

Question: What can you say about a person if she or he doesn't have enough will or a strong enough wish for enlightenment, for Self-realization?

Shri Mataji: You see, actually this is the point: you should know that we cannot force it on anyone. We cannot force it. We are very sorry. It cannot be forced. Not at all. And moreover, if you want to leave us, it's all right. Very good. Thank you very much. You see, also in the kingdom of God there aren't many places.

Question: Is it possible to sing or make music which are the same as truth?

Shri Mataji: Of course. Music is very close to it. But first you must get your realization. Then you will have the knowledge to know which is the right music and which is not.

[A disruption from the audience]

Shri Mataji: I have allowed you to ask, but that doesn't mean that you take the whole night for it... I think you better go. Otherwise, I'm sorry. You are not worthy of anything. All right. Please go. Please get up and go. They are not interested in anything... You can go away if you don't want to. All right. Go. Bye-bye. Thank you... Now, so I think you better stop the problems. May God bless you. By answering you, you are not going to get your realization... Answering a question... say you ask me a question and I answer it. Are you going to get your realization? You see, these are some people who don't like it. That's why they behave like this. Now, I think we should stop now. Because our purpose is to get Self-realization, isn't it? And to feel the all-pervading power.

Those who want to seek the truth, one can give it. I cannot force it. I am telling you that. And through arguments also, I cannot work it out. The problem is that people are not truthful about themselves. They just become superficial. All right, it doesn't matter. It always happens in some places on the first day. It's part of the game. Now, so, should we have our realization now?

For that, I have told you, I cannot force it on you. But there are two conditions which are very crucial. One condition is that you are not to feel guilty and depressed. Forget the past. Come to the present. This is the first condition.

And the second condition is very important: that you have to forgive everyone. Now, as it is, people say that it's difficult to forgive. "Oh, I cannot." And they just start thinking, how can we forgive? Oh, that's again the Finnish syndrome.

[A woman in the audience becomes agitated]

Woman: She feels like she has to work... It's a Finnish problem. I feel so. She's shaking. She can't stop. Nervous. What are we to do? We are integrated in this country. We are educated very much that we have to work and work and then we don't have any emotion outside. Then we drink and do other kinds of things. We are the responsible ones. You have to do it... This is because the Scandinavians came here thousands of years ago and overruled Finland... They put us down. We don't have the culture. Ancient Finnish people have been like India. Red Indians. Okay. It's true. They were farmers. Good people. Like India. Red Indians. And no problems with nature.

Shri Mataji: That's true. Okay. So we have established that again. Everything is good. Now we've got the connection. Okay. Like Red Indians. Now we're scared. Okay. Now we're better. No, no. You must work. I'm not saying it's easy. I work very hard, I should say. And I'm so very old. I must be the oldest woman here today. I work... Now, how are you? Good, eh? That's nice. All right. Now, what work you do? Paint? You are an artist... You get the heat. Isn't it? Are you feeling better?... Better now? It's all right... I think you've got an allergy from the paint. But it's too much heat, isn't it? Too much heat... Liver problem. Yes. All right. Now put him in the right position...

So, now, how are you? Quite fine. You feel all right? You feel the good things? Yes, I think so. It's all right. Now, don't doubt. You come and see them and fix it up. You are all right. This is a normal person... He came last year to our program and then he could sleep the whole night through. Now, enjoy yourself. Thank you very much. But you must see them and you should be in the collective. That's very important, because if your nail is cut out, then the body doesn't look after it. So, you have to be connected. You should come to the collective. People are very over-individualistic, aren't they? So, you have to be connected. You are part and parcel of one body.

How are you? It didn't feel in balance. You work very hard. What do you do? Computer is worse than tennis. Now, you just say, "Mother, make me the divine computer." Just say it. From your heart, please say. Left heart... now. It's all right. Come on. Of course, it's there, right? Are you feeling anything in your hands now? Again, say, "Mother, make me the divine computer." It's all right. Now, it's better. Cool. Yes. It's better now. See? Feeling it now. All right? So, the computer is working. This is the divine computer. It's absolutely programmed by the divine. It's not programmed by the human brain. There's no error.

...You've been to some guru or something? No? You don't say any mantras?... This chakra is there. All right. So, now, you'll have to take this out for now... You are a seeker and you must seek the truth, all right? In India, everybody says, "Hare Rama, Hare Krishna." Have they got their realization? Just think of that. By saying that, you don't get it. All right, now, let's see. Put your hands. Now, how will you recognize Rama? Or how will you recognize Krishna? You have to recognize. All right?... Don't feel guilty. You're supposed to worship Krishna and you're feeling guilty. He's the one who established Leela. What is there to be guilty about in a Leela? It's all a play... What's the use of wearing all these things and saying, "Rama, Rama, Krishna, Krishna," and not knowing anything about it? There it is. Now, forget it. Nonsense.

...She has been to some guru or something? No one? To a clairvoyant? Oh, yes. Some fortune teller. That's it. Now, don't go to anyone. All right? You know you are your own fortune. All right.

...The British ruled us for three hundred years, Indians. We never took them seriously. But many of you died. Died, but you see, we didn't take them so seriously. Not as you people have taken. We thought they were stupid. Really. We thought they were stupid people. And we don't believe that you die if somebody kills you. You will be born again. But, you see, if you are stupid, you have no help. They are much worse than us, those who tried to kill us... But still, we have maintained ourselves, all right, by thinking they are stupid. We never took anything from them. Also, they, for three hundred years they lived with us, they did not take anything from us.

...I get this illness now through, I think it's through asthma and arthritis. Yes, but I know where you are. But what about your husband?... He's not well? He's not healthy... All right? So you come and see them. All these diseases can disappear. Forget about your husband.

...Just say in your heart, "Mother, I am my own master." Now, that's it. All right? Started now? Did you say, "I am my own master?" All right? Now, keep it up.

...She says that her breathing is just difficult. It feels like a cardboard box... Hold your hand. Now, give it. Again, hold your hand... Better now? Not yet? All right. Put both the hands on the Mother Earth. Now it's all right here. You've got it... Now breathe. Better? Now breathe. Even better now. Now breathe. Good. All right? So you see them and they will give you something which you should use later. All right? Come and see them in the follow-on. They will give you something to put in the nose which will clean it. All right.

All right, thank you very much. I love you. I love you too. The President of Cincinnati has declared today as Sri Māori Day in Cincinnati. I will read this proclamation which I'm very thrilled about because some of you will know that Sri Māori is an international figure. She is a diplomat. Her husband has been the Secretary General of a very large United Nations organization. He has been knighted by the Queen of England. He has received the highest awards from many nations. And he is one of the living legends in the world today. His name is Sir C. P. Chiraswava. And Sri Mataji herself has been honored all over the world. And it is my pleasure to read this proclamation. It says, Whereas Sri Mataji has developed a simple meditation technique, Sahaja Yoga, which enables the all-fast experience of self-realization, the breakthrough of a new awareness. And whereas Sahaja Yoga is the next evolutionary step for humanity, which can bring the transformation of human consciousness to a higher level. And whereas the city of Cincinnati is honored by the visit of Sri Mataji Nopala Devi, who will introduce to Sahaja Yoga the experience of harmonious well-being and inner transformation that can lead us out of the confusion and frustration of modern living and spark the greatest inner transformation yet seen. Now therefore, I, Dwight Tillery, Mayor of the city of Cincinnati, do hereby proclaim Thursday, September 10, 1992, as Sri Mataji Nopala Devi Day in Cincinnati. Thank you.

I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the very outset, we have to know that truth is what it is. We cannot change it. We cannot conceptualize it. Unfortunately, at this human level, we cannot feel it. We have to become something more. Unless and until that happens to us, we cannot know the truth, the Absolute Truth. I call you all as seekers of truth. And if you are seekers of truth, you have to open your mind like scientist and treat whatever I am telling you as a hypothesis and if it works, you should accept and grow in it. You have been already told, I think about the subtle system that is built in within us. This system has been built in during our evolutionary process. Whatever is the truth has to be tangible. It should not be accepted blindfolded because I am telling you. You have to verify yourself that whatever I am telling you is the truth because you will have the actualization of the experience of the truth. That is, firstly, that you are not this body, this mind, this ego, conditionings, but you are the pure spirit. This is the first truth about yourself. And the second one is that there is an all-pervading power of Divine Love which they call by different names. You may call it God's Divine Love, you may call it the cool breeze of the Holy Spirit, you may call it Paramachaitanya, call it by any name. But there is such a subtle force, energy which exists, which does all the living work. Here now we see flowers, so beautiful, and you take them for granted. We don't question how this miracle has taken place. Look at your eyes. We don't question how this camera has come to exist. Look at your brain, what a computer it is. We never question it, how it has come to us, how we have become human beings, and how all these things are working within us automatically. If you ask who runs our heart, the doctors would say it's an autonomous nervous system. But if you go further and ask who is this auto? Who is running this heart? There are so many questions which cannot be answered by science, and science is not our conclusive. Recently I was reading a book, The Limits of Science, and he has asked three questions in that book. How do I come to be a human being, is the first question. Second is, what is the purpose of my life, and why should I live any longer? All these three questions can be very easily answered once you become the Spirit.

This transformation is also called by many names. People call it self-realization. Some call it self-hood. Some say it's self-knowledge. But what is this self they are talking about, and what will happen if you get the self-hood? I have to tell you that all of you have got your divinity within yourself, and surprisingly it is absolutely intact. Whatever you might have done, whatever mistakes you might have committed, your divinity is absolutely intact, it is not at all disturbed, cannot be perished, cannot be destroyed by anything. The reason is, this divinity is eternal, and whatever is eternal cannot be harmed. Nobody can destroy it, and that is within you there, and sometimes the glimpse of that may be that you think whatever you see, there must be something beyond, and when you start thinking that, then you become a seeker of truth. Surprising in these modern times, there are so many seekers of truth, and so many are lost. When we start seeking truth, we definitely have to put faith into something. When we put our faith into religion also, what do we find that religion is power-oriented or money-oriented, so there is fundamentalism. Whatever attitude people might have taken, those who started this religion are immaculate people, they are divine people, and they were like the flowers on one tree of spirituality. Only we have plucked these flowers and we are fighting. How can we fight in the name of God? One should reason it out, and once you reason it out, you start thinking there must be something more to it.

So when this residual force, we call it as Kundalini in India, Kundal means coils, starts rising, it passes through six centers and pierces through the seventh one, which we call as Brahma-Rundra, or the fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone in your childhood. And this opens, it is the actualization of your baptism, it is not just I put my hand on your head and say, now you are baptized. This kind of self-certificate is not going to help us. Now if you become, say, the governor of this place, then you have certain powers. Now if you become the self, or if you become the self-realized soul, then you must have some powers. And people normally certify themselves that this is that. This is not the way you can achieve that state. You have to be honest. Because if you are honest seekers, then we should expect the actualization of the experience first thing, about which Thomas has written in his treatise. I wish you could read the Gospel of Thomas, in which he has clearly said that the experience of self-realization is the most important thing and that is to be achieved. You must be knowing Thomas ran away, because I think Paul was trying to dominate him or whatever it was. And ultimately he went to India, but before going there he went to Egypt and he put all his treatise in a jar. For fifty years they have been trying to put it in common language and now the book is out, partly.

So, this experience has to be there that you feel your spirit and feel this all-pervading power all around us. So far you have not felt it. So, we have to be humble about it. As Christ has said, Meek in heart we inherit the earth. That's a fact. You have to be meek about it that so far we have not found the truth and that this divinity is within us which is going to connect us to that all-pervading power by which we are going to know the truth. Apart from many other benefits that you get by the awakening of this force within you, one, your physical conditions improve. Once you come to Sahaja Yoga, you are amazed how your diseases are improved. Here in Cincinnati, one lady who was suffering from cancer got cured. But curing people is a funny job. Once you cure them they just disappear. They are very happy, they write to you, thank you very much, you have cured us. But they are not the ones who give light to others. Secondly, mentally people improve very much. All their habits which are destructive, which we have acquired, in any way, they disappear. And disappear so fast that I have known people in England that overnight they gave up drugs, overnight. Today they are beautiful people, professionals, working very well. This I am telling you, in the year 1970 was happening in England. Or say 74, especially in a big group it happened.

Then the second advantage is that, that you find your own spirit. Your spirit shines in your attention. Thus your attention becomes active. Like the light, now there is a light here, when it falls on something you can see clearly. But it doesn't act on that, maybe little bit it might sort of spoil it. But it doesn't act. But when your attention is enlightened, then wherever you put your attention it acts. That means on your hands also you find this cool breeze blowing, and the fingertips which are the sympathetic nervous endings, become enlightened. So five, six and seven, these centers on the left and the seven centers on the right get enlightened. And you immediately know what's wrong with you, and also you can find out what's wrong with others. So what has happened to your attention is that, you have got a new awareness, where you become collectively conscious. Who is the other, when the microcosm becomes the microcosm. When a drop becomes the ocean, it becomes the ocean. In the same way you start feeling the problems of other people, and you talk the language of centers. If you know how to cure your centers and the centers of others, imagine what miracles you can do.

If you see the problems of human beings, we can say ecological problems, health problems, all kinds of problems we have. These are due to fundamentally human beings. And the problem of human beings is that, they are due to fundamentally their centers. If you can put these centers right, you can put human beings right, as well as you can put all the problems completely solved. Like I would like to tell you that in India, there are three doctors in Delhi University who have got their MD. They have doctorate in medicine, about the curing of very incurable diseases. No doubt, with Sahaja Yoga, many incurable diseases have been cured, even blood cancer and all that has been cured. But at the very outset I would like to tell you, we are not here to cure people, but make you all into doctors, so that all of you can go round and cure. Because single handed, how many people I can cure? So it's important that you all should achieve your power of the Spirit, by which you can enlighten the whole world. It's like one candle which is enlightened, can enlighten another candle very easily. But surprisingly people say, but we can enlighten ourselves, how can a candle which is not enlightened, can enlighten itself? It's illogical. But anybody who gets enlightenment, any one of you who gets enlightenment, can enlighten another person, because you can raise the Kundalini of others. You can give realization to others. You get these powers automatically within you.

For which of course, I hope Bala has told you, you cannot pay. Because it's a living process of evolution. How much did we pay to become human beings? Or how much did we pay to this Mother Earth for giving us these flowers? I mean there's a built in quality in the Mother Earth that she can sprout and these plants also have a beaten capacity to produce flowers, or a seed to become a plant. All living process is done without going to the bank, without knowing about money. This is the first thing you must understand, that you cannot pay for it. It is so invaluable that you can't pay for it. It is so vital that it has to happen. Specially now the time has come. I call it as the blossom time. Some people say it's the last judgement in Koran, it is written as a kyama, when your hands will speak. All these, also there's Aquarius age, age of enlightenment, people talk of so many things. But this talk is just a lip service. It has to happen, it has to be actualized. Otherwise you should not accept somebody who is just giving a big sermon and collecting money after that. It is the experience that you all should have and the powers that are bestowed by them. As I told you, when the Spirit shines in your attention, you become enlightened and your attention becomes enlightened and effective. You start feeling another person, his centers on your fingertips and also the centers that are your own, that self-knowledge you feel it on your fingertips.

Now the second quality of the Spirithood is this, that you know the Absolute Truth. Because Spirit is the source of truth. Supposing now somebody in India has been in jail and he's released from jail, he doesn't know how to settle in Indian society perhaps. So he comes to Germany with all the necessary dress of a saint and people start following him. Nobody knows that he's really the saint or not. He talks big because in India everybody reads all these books, they can talk very big. I'll tell you lots of stories and one can believe what he's talking but he is a thief or he's a man who is much less in spirituality than you are and he's just muting you, using you, using your money and calling himself a saint. Till he's completely exposed or discovered you follow that person. But actually he is that or not, how will you find out? Which is the way, which is the vehicle by which you will know whether this man is real or not? Because you do not know the Absolute Truth, whatever he tries to make up, you follow. When you are a realized soul, you put your hands towards such a person, immediately you'll start getting terrible heat in the body or maybe a blister might come also, for a while. So you become a barometer of Absolute Truth. There are many people who don't believe in God. Like I went to Russia, they said that, Mother we believe in you. There's thousands and thousands in Russia I must say. The awakening of Russians is tremendous. They are very sensitive to spirituality. They won't accept anybody false, somehow I don't know what. And they asked Me, Mother we believe that you are there, you are something, but how will you prove there is God? I said, all right. You put your hands and ask question, is there God or not? And they started feeling the cool breeze in their hands and tremendous cool breeze. Then they said, how are you to believe that Christ was the Son of God? All right, again you put up your hands and say. Even if you have ten small children who are realized souls and if you tie up their eyes and ask them, now what's wrong with these gentlemen? They will all raise the same finger, supposing they raise this finger or this finger. You ask, have you got some heart trouble? Immediately you'll say, how do you know? The diagnosis itself will be done by little children of ten years.

It is fantastic no doubt. It is too fantastic that people can believe. But you are fantastic. Supposing I take a little box in an Indian village and show them that this is called as television and you can see all kinds of films in it. They'll say, what, this box? We also all think we are just boxes. But once you put to the mains, they will see how fantastic it is. So I'm talking about something which is metascience, that the whole science is built in within us, the whole knowledge and it starts manifesting and you are amazed how you can do all these things. So the second thing is that you know the Absolute Truth. Now what happens when we know the Absolute Truth? We do not fall into any sects, into any kind of false type of enticements that we have. Immediately we know this is false. But another great advantage is that when you know the Absolute Truth, there is no question of fighting because everybody sees the same Truth, knows the same Truth. I used to tell them about Freud and they didn't like it very much at that time but now he's exposed. So now, when he's now exposed they're agreeing to it. But so many would not sit in my program because I said, the Freud has taken out some yarn out of his head and you have accepted it. There's no reality in it. So you know the reality and all of you know the same reality so there's no question of fighting, no question arguing, there are no dogmas, there are no theories, nothing. Everybody sees the same point of view. So there will be no wars, there will be no quarrel, nothing of the kind.

So this Absolute Truth is only known when you become the Spirit. That's a fact. Spirit is the universal being. Now if Spirit is the universal being, you become a universal being. That means that you believe in all the religions and you believe in all the prophets, all the incarnations and you see the essence. In every religion is the same and the indication is that first you become a realized one. Christ has said you have to be born again. Everybody has said the same thing. But because of ignorance, because of manipulation, we all fight in the name of God. When you become the universal being, you forget about races, about nations, false religions, false things and you all become absolutely congenial with each other and such a rapport is established between people. See now, what is the difference we have between ourselves? You cut the skin a little bit and you'll find the same nerve, the same muscle, the same bone in that part. Whether it is in England or it is in Australia, India or Africa. No difference, it's just skin deep. We smile the same way, laugh the same way, cry the same way, feel the same way. But still we are not conscious. This is not in awareness that we are all universal beings. What is there to fight in the name of these superficial skin deep things?

So, what happens is this, that a kind of a great brotherhood starts emerging out. We have programs in India once a year and about three thousand people you can see and these three thousand people they are from fifty five countries. I've never seen them quarrelling, fighting with any violence. Even a football match you cannot see without a fight. Here such love, such understanding how they know each other, how they understand each other, how they love each other and how they intensely work for the benevolence of others is very remarkable. When I first went to Russia, you'll be amazed, twenty five German Sahaja Yogis came in. And these twenty five German Sahaja Yogis told me, when I asked them, Why are you here? They said, Mother, don't you think it is our responsibility? I said, No. Why? You didn't do anything wrong, your forefathers might have done something wrong. No, it's our responsibility because they were our forefathers. And with great acidity, even when I left Russia they were there and they worked it out and today I must say spiritually, apart from India, Russia is the strongest country. But people are so sensitive. I think we lost lot of our energy in choices and in the so called freedom and abandonment. While their government might have been wrong, might have been not so good, but the people are extremely simple and extremely loving, very affectionate. I was so surprised the way there were thousands and thousands who got their realization.

Here I am very much surprised at our mayor here that he has recognized me. The first time I think any mayor who has really recognized me in this way. I am really must say Cincinnati must be some special place where they have done it. Of course in Italy there are some mayors in small villages who have tremendous respect for me but this kind of thing, proclamation, is such a surprise to me shows that in this place, there is an awareness that we need transformation. With transformation not only your physical, mental, emotional problems are solved but material problems are solved. Agriculture improves such a lot because these vibrated things like water and all that when you give it to the crops, we have seen it has grown ten times. We have some doctors of agriculture who have experimented with it and have been trying to publish a book about it. Not only agriculture but so many other things like we can say the ecological problem you have, the trees which were dying with the acid rain have been saved and they are emitting very good air to counterbalance the ecological problem. So many things can be done once you have this force working in you. It is there, it's your own for which you don't have to pay, just you have to have desire to have it. It's so simple as that.

But I don't know why. One lady told me in the plane, she was American, that we have had so many hoaxes that Mother maybe they don't believe you. But no, I was the first to come here. But I was surprised the way they said to me that we won't believe you unless and till you take money. Suppose that. Another thing, they said, how can it be so easy? But if it is so, suppose, I mean I am saying that just to believe, there is a diamond kept here. I say it's a real diamond. Won't you all rush to take it? But if I am saying it is so easy, on this point they wouldn't accept. They believe you must suffer before you get spiritually. I said you have suffered enough now, believe me. You don't have to suffer. They think you have to go to Himalayas and stand on your head and starve yourself or go to the desert and get nirvana. In any way you die, so you call it death is nirvana, you can get it. All these kind of ideas they gave me I just, I didn't know what to talk to them and all sorts of false people invaded, not only Indians, Americans, Portuguese, all sorts of people invaded and they succumbed to them. I didn't come to America for nine years for the same reason. I thought now their ideas about truth are so funny that you have to go to Himalayas or you must do this and do that, that I will never be able to really work it out. After nine years, Sahaja Yogis told me, now Mother it's changing, you better come. So I came and since I was here three years back, I'm sorry I should have come out here but I've been very busy. South America is also very well in spirituality. They are very faithful, simple people. I don't say that complicated people don't get realization, they do, all of them. But complicated people have to devote little more time to get this connection alright. Like you see any complicated machinery, if it goes out of order you have to pay more attention to it. In the same way, once you get your realization you have to come to the collective. Collective means that everybody is there who knows all about Sahaja Yoga and you must master it. That also is free, absolutely free, you don't have to pay for it. You should have all the knowledge about this subtle system and you should get all the powers that are within you which can manifest.

This is only My desire for which I'm running day and night all over the world. As they said, it's true that on one side I have a very good family and a very good husband, I have grandchildren and I'm myself seventy years of age so you can imagine I'm still travelling and doing all this work because even My family thinks that it's very important that transformation must take place so that there's a complete emancipation of human beings and people should transform, to transform the whole world and this is a very special time. I hope people from Cincinnati will respond to it and will get their Self-realization. We'll take about ten to fifteen minutes for that and those who do not want to have their Self-realization should leave the house, should leave the place because I cannot force, it's your freedom to get your realization. If you don't want it, you are free. If you want to enter into the Kingdom of God, you can. If you don't want, you can because this is the work of Divine Love. Nothing can be forced and this compassion that is flowing as the Divine Love will not force anything on you. It respects your freedom. So I have to humbly request you those who do not want to have realization should leave the place and should not in any way disturb others who want to have it. But definitely I would request you not to disturb when we are in the process of our meditation, which takes about ten minutes only. As I told you, it's a collective happening and you have to come to the collective to work it out and to know about it. In that you'll be amazed how you will grow fast and you'll understand each and every thing. I'm sure you must be having lots of questions also in your mind. As I'm here only for one day, I would say that you should write your questions and send them over and I'll try to answer them. Tomorrow I'm going away to Canada. And I'll be back again after one year. I promise I'll be here for a longer period next time.

Now there are three conditions which I must tell you, which are very simple. The first condition is that you have to be absolutely confident that you all are going to get your Self-realization tonight. Absolutely confident. Don't doubt yourself. So the second one follows that you should not feel guilty at all at this moment here. After all, you are human beings, you are not gods. And human beings can only make mistakes, isn't it? And this all-pervading power about which I'm talking to you, which is going to work out your Self-realization, is the ocean of forgiveness and very power ocean of forgiveness. And whatever mistakes you might have committed, it can dissolve everything. So don't feel guilty at all and this idea of being sinner and all that, just forget it. If you are the seeker of truth, it's your right to get your yoga, your union with the Divine. It's your right. Sahaja means with you is born. This right to get this union. So please, don't feel guilty. I must tell you very frankly, when you feel guilty, the center on the left side here catches you. As a result you might get spondylitis, you might get angina. Also your system, the organs, might become lethargic. So no use feeling guilty, what's the use? If you have made mistakes, you think you have made real mistakes, just face it and finish it off. But don't carry it all here. But it has become a fashion item. One lady told me, I feel very guilty for Afghanistan. I said, what are you, Afghani? No. Then are you Russian? No. Then why are you feeling? I'm just feeling. So please, in short, you have to be very pleasantly towards yourself. Then the third one is a very simple condition, is that you have to forgive everyone without thinking about them.

It was really a great achievement, I must say, to portray King Arthur like this and giving it a real paint, or I should say the picture of Sahaja Yoga. I can't imagine how can people in Sahaja Yoga have become so creative and how they are expressing all these things with such beauty, such clarity. I don't know what words to choose to say that if this kind of thing works out, all kinds of creativity will start acting through you people. This one was a remarkable drama, no doubt, and also was written so well and also organized so well because I used to act myself in a drama and many a times I've directed many drachmas, so I know how difficult it is to organize the whole thing without losing any time. And it was, the whole thing was done with such depth and understanding. I must congratulate the English, the British, all of them who have done such a good job.

I also acted in many plays and one of them was about a martyr who was killed in the war of independence. And I felt that later on will there be some people who will also make dramas about this kind of thing that there is divine life and divine light that guides you and saves you all the time. The same kind of thing that I had before, I can see it projected now through you people. It's very, very remarkable and I'm very happy that now you have developed such talent and have discovered so many talents among yourself. I don't know what to say for the future but I think future is going to be great with you all artists taking up some sort of a theme like this on such a big stage. I mean you can do a lot, no doubt, and you should not give it up. That's the best way to look at it, that you are not to give it up and you are going to work it out. No. This rain understands many things. I don't know.

Now, the play that was organized by the Swiss people was also very, very remarkable, I must say, because I don't know they had such talent and that they acted in such a proper manner. Not only that but they brought forth so many points which I have never mentioned before perhaps, which are to be seen what are the allurement of our life and how we get drifted into it. I must say it's very, very credible, very creditable for them to put up such a nice show and so entertaining. I never felt the time was passing out and things were wonderful. May God bless them. All of you put together can make a big team of Hollywood, I think.

I'm very also happy about the children who came all the way from Ukraine. First time when I had gone to Ukraine, I remember so many of them were suffering from the charitable suffering and I saw them and I couldn't help it. I just started crying. I couldn't help seeing so many people suffering for no part of their... It was a very great mishap that occurred and also the whole mismanagement and carelessness on the part of the government also. One couldn't say anything about it but they all got cured, I think. They are all right and there are no more of the people who suffered. That time I saw them but they are no more there. I saw them last time when I was in Ukraine. I saw thousands and thousands of them were there. So all this was something great.

Also you enjoyed the music of Ajit Kannakadai very much. Very remarkable I felt was this that his son in the raga Gorakh Kalyan. It's Gorakh Nar who had visited. His guru also, Machindranath, had visited Ukraine. They were there. And just see how simultaneously these people played that music while he, Ajit Kannakadai sang Gorakh Kalyan. It's very remarkable I tell you how coincidence is coming. I just thought of these two great saints and they are from Maharashtra, from near Lahuri. They had a big mountain where they used to live and they travelled all over. I think they also went to Bolivia. They have described in their books all these places. But Ukraine they have been definitely there and they make very good designs of different chakras of without understanding I think. But they said we know about it but we don't know how to raise the kumalini in Bolivia.

So that is how it's all something. Sounds to be all so coordinated, so original, so much well and the whole team works out so well. And you two are doing such a good job by creating a feeling of funness among us through your place, through your art, through your talent. I can't imagine how it has happened in my lifetime. I never expected that such a thing would happen. May God bless you all and bless your talents, everything. I'm very happy. May God bless you.

Do you have a lot of people to check out? We do. You are homecoming by car? Yes. They said that's not very good for the main damage in the government. You stay somewhere in the night? Or you die in the right place? That's fine. We are leaving a train in Kewa Kewa Lake in New Zealand. So it should be down there now. There is one in the left of the train. So we should get to the double top tomorrow. So we have five people to go. And a lot of them just changed their view from New Zealand. We are all just going to get a little bit of a check. We will stay half way. Don't stop and walk half way. Everything until Stephen? Yes. We are going to take a look at the train so we can get back to New Zealand. You can come and check. Sorry. Here we come. Do you have anything to add? We can talk to you if you want. Thank you.

Guys, there were discussing with me. Do you want to come? I want to come to the U.S. I want to see. This is one month journey. I'll be back on the second of spring. Last year we did three. But four. We are going to go to the U.S. One day it's a long journey. And then I'm going to come here. This is that. So I'm going to go. I think we see you. You can try.

They grow here. Oh yes, they do. It's a very good thing. And they're white. They're not the same. Well, not the same. There's a change in the job. There's a change. Now. I watched it. When I was a little girl, she used to get a lot of books. They were all the same. But, um, you're a very good girl. Yes. I'm a very good girl. You can go directly from here right here. Very much. It's very good. And so how many more? Yes. From here? Yes, this one's good. I'll tell you another day. It's good. And that way, I have to go here. One year of bed and done yet. The TV study that I did. We're going to read the rest. Just out there. From Melbourne. The meadow. From via Japan. And then walking. And then back. And then, um, yes. Very good. Wow. Practically, I've done only at one place. I have not visited anywhere. I've not been there. I have something from now on. But I don't think I'm very divided. It's all good.

I wanted to show you a poster. I didn't mean to show you for a long time. But, when Cheryl and I went to New Zealand we had to read. And went on a much better path. And, in this park, I've done this picture. It's like Trigga National Park. And then, I've done this one. Wherever you go, all the people outside the center. So, it's easy. Have you visited New Zealand? Yes. Have you visited New York? Yes. I've done one of the places where there are mud pools and there's a lot of mud pools. Have you visited New Zealand? It's extremely natural. Many people go for their animal. Even from India. But, as you can see, I go for one thing. I don't see it. And there's every climate, everything in the world in one place. I wish I could see it. Hello, thank you.

The lakes are just beautiful. The lakes in New Zealand. And there's one miter peak in one of the lakes. It's like the map of India. It goes up. It's a bit like the metaphor. But it's like the map of India going up. And there's a big lion that sits in the front. Like a lion. What's it called? Lion rock? It looks like this lion guarding this map of India going up into a point. It's a mountain in the middle of the lake. We need a mountain. But I don't know how Indians have discovered. They go to the Rajesh to the leader. I'm in the world leader. This brother went to Bhushan. So I was wondering how to go to the leader. If you're one of the leaders then you're not. You play because Germany is high. What are the developments? Lollipop. Say please. Sagarati. We changed those flights for you. So now you are leaving on Monday. It's a half an hour journey. How long until the final of the three hours? One hour. One hour to take off is less than one hour. Very slow. I want to go to Taiwan. I'm still ok. Taiwan is not very good. Japan. So first we go to Japan. Then we go to China. So that was done very easily. I checked again. So, we're going to go to the next station. We're already tapping. It'll be worse at the end. All right. This is the station. It's very dangerous. The last station was technical. It was some massive.

I was going to go and have her last night and you can put this out to Aisha's too. And we need to hunt her down. So she doesn't have the children. She ran away just for a moment and then goes, Ah! Here you go, the new girl in the house with the hair is called James. Nice element you've done. Right. Can I give it a big bite? Take a bite. Whatever you can tell them to have. Because they'll be there. But you are a little slimmer than my children. Your eyes are not open. Believe ourselves, girls, behind. It is to be related to this substance.

How do you know what's the best way? You cannot organize God. You see, this is something innate that has to work within you. You don't have to tell them, don't do this. You wish for yourself. They don't want to do anything other than, like, this, that. Just let us do blind things. You are a little slimmer. That's being also very nice. You must grow in that. Forget about your child. You cannot grow in it. So you have to try. You see, one thing I'll tell you, logic is here. The child is there. The child makes formations, he'll come back. So he should decide to stay, he can just stay. Now, what happens is that the whole thinking about a soul could be how the world is. Let it be. You see, that's what I'm saying, that you must be thinking of God. You've got to be thinking of God. You have to understand that there is one thing I've been there. If you go and you see God, you will know that. I'm not saying that. You know, I've spent so much time with God. But first you have to get it. It's very simple, isn't it? Yes, it is. I won't bother you any time. It's not easy. You see, you have to learn. You have to say that's for you. You need to stay with God. See the problem. You have to always let God make you the best of yourself. If you make it, then you'll understand. You will develop so that you will develop your consciousness, your vision. You will be the one burning your children. You will find your solutions. I know something. That is the kind of your destiny. Just let them hear you. What are the reasons you have to do? Just tell them, I'm all right. They'll get taken away. You'll be the God of the world. They'll be the dragon. Like that tree one of the brothers. You have to be the breakthrough. You are strong. They will tell you how to live it. What is the reason you have to do? Not listen to them. They will doubt listen to them. That's the reason you have to do. Thank you.

I have also learned that you know how to give your Mother a solution. Mother may call it. You have to surround yourself with desires and learn. And you can make it your children. Like that. You will follow. You have to serve people. And it's close. As I knew that you are in a very unique place. You can do that as well. May I have some water? Thank you. Here is Mary. Mary, some simple. I have a body. Children in the water. I'll be ready. Thank you. Shri Mataji. Look at Me. I'll be at the man. I know that. But. No, I wanted you to join. Also, I have something for surgery. He has got to try. He wanted to do things for Me also. Sit. What's the problem? Let's go. I'll talk to you. All the people there. I'll just have you now. All right? I'll just do like this. Yes. Is it balanced now? No, no. It should have been. No, you are not here. No? I have to be supportive. I have to practice all my own body. I know it's going out to Sahaja Yoga very well. The another fellow has to take an oath of awakening. In Jesus's name, there is very little left. There will be better but it will be like that. It's very open and wide. Yes. It's very good. Very nice. Thank you. Yes. Absolutely. You have also got very great new people. Yes. I'm very happy to see you coming down from the start. Is it a good time? Yes. Is that the right time? Yes. Then you are growing something. If you are a Muslim, then you are good. Yes. They are sweet of you. But they are asking for me. Oh. Yes. Thank you for doing what I'm doing by today. Yes, it is free from Cullen'sream33. dot com slash. Yes. We are using the directly to highlight some of what happened.

What happened to my cat? Now it's full. Seep check. I see. That's what is the problem. I'm waiting. Six have got to put that in. Because they don't know who any people are. But still, you know, they are not so deep sometimes. What is it? Bye. We have to identify them. Just with the password. I know that. Something has happened inside. We are going on the path of international service. And the electronic media. We are also interested in the training of the police. We are organizing some films like that. There is a possibility next year it's been instituted. Radio Australia, what we see here in Australia, they send me to India to research the ownership of the media. The media has a television station, radio station, media events. So there is a possibility now.

Hello. It's great to see you. Thank you. Hello. We are going to go in. I am there. I am going to show you the media. Every kind of seats are crowded here. Nothing all over the world. All right. So I am coming. Oops, sorry. Should we go down? I will go down. Please return to your share of service desk. Please switch.

Can we have two of these? I'll just go with those two. I think these bags are in the bag. Alright. Did you want to do more shopping with them? Yes. I can come back and get them. The car is just down the low by the way. I'll drive straight in. The guy said, will you be long sir? I said, a couple of hours. It's okay. Do they have a car park here? I'm in the car park under me. What we have to do though is time it so we get Mother to the park. My wife would never get me out on an expedition like this. It's amazing isn't it? I'm fine. I'm not going to Australia. No worries. Are you requiring any assistance at all? No. Excuse me.

This is the complete dinner set? This is our hotel room. That's $239. $12. Perfect. $29 for a 20 piece. A setting for four people for a 14 a plate, four soup, four side and four cups and saucers. None of them rest as they are. No, I know but can I buy a separate meal? Yes, you can buy them more separately. Well those ones, that one's $58 and that one's $74. And the teapots price $130. Can we get this one for two sets? Two sets for our people? Yes. I'll put the string around the maker for you. That will be wonderful. Which one? This one. They're all priced individually. That one's priced at... Oh there's no price on that one. They're individual covered casseroles and they're priced at $22 each. That's a jam-porter like a sugar bowl and that's $26. And that's a gravy boat, it's priced at $80. And then we have the teapots. That's like a meat pot. Is it like a...

Lord Hall was a very famous man. Nice man, very nice, very straightforward English man. Man of order. He sought to respect, he goes out. This was a famous, this thing called an E.N.C. Just listen to the first one. The one that's not... E.N.C. that's enough. He used to make tea set. He said, Real old willow. How good is that? One of the ginger, it's quality. You're okay? It's $1.59. It used to be a tea set like this before. All this material is very, very cheap in Hong Kong. In Hong Kong you can buy these much cheaper. What is it made in? With coffee, lots of things. Right. Can you see the coffee? Take from my tatty here. This guy, hi there. Hey, Mira. Harman. I am an E.N.C. But nowadays you can't get this in England, no? You have to order for six months. Really?

This is the one I wanted to buy. So we couldn't get it. The whole offering. They said you have to order E.C. to our soul. Good. He said, I'm not going to have any tea. I felt that it's all right. So then I came here and it was on promotion, the same. Really? I bought it here much after project. Was that two years ago? Must be more. More than that. Because in England suddenly it all became like six months order. Walk all the way into the supermarkets and big, big places. Self-ridges and all that. Now what? Oh yes, Mother. It's not okay. Four thousand thirty-eight. Day day. May be day. We will send it. It will go downstairs, then we can pick up and we will drive home. This for you.

So how many you have taken? Two. Two people. Okay. So how many people are you taking? Two people? One. Okay. How many people? Two people. One person. Yes, there's a number of children who are going down, aren't they? But if you have gas or heat, then you can't use something that is aesthetic before. But in America they just use, what you call them, people, please. Even rich people. It's uncivilized. They are limited. All the time it's a big deal in our region. All the time. I went to a very rich man's house and he too had only and he said that my maid comes in the morning so we have this. Everything comes and I have to go. I have to go to the cosmetics store. And the gold company? The gold company is not here but they are here. David Jones is here. We can go to David Jones. David Jones will be there. Do you like it? Yeah. Just straight through there. Just there. Thank you. All done. Thank you.

Where are we going to get this from? It's called the B.I.B. area. B.I.B. area? Yeah. And see the opening just there? Just straight from there. That's alright. Thank you. B.I.B. area. Good job. Thank you. Where's the gold? Smell it. It's edible. It's cute. I'll show you this one then. This is very nice. It's like a jacket. Because the leg is not going to close. It gives the egg a jacket. Do you like this one, man? It's nice and soft. Weighty. Go side here. Smaller side. Smaller. How much is this? This is too small. Where's the height of this? It's too far enough. It's not that big. I'll buy this one. One blue and one red. Very small. Thank you. The first one I'll try to use is small. I mean, your small size fits me. So I can't believe it. I mean, India is at least large. But sometimes it's a large. Here it's a large.

And she was talking about getting the purple light running up through the head and all this sort of thing. We couldn't keep a straight face. But all the people were saying, straight face, that all the boots and creation were there. It was just extraordinary. You have three jokes and jokers. With the stage where you are, you can only laugh and everything. And after it was all over, I suggested we went down to the sea, to footsail, because we had such rubbish. That's right. And Arlene Robbins said, you can't go there because they have all the needles from people injecting themselves along the seashore. They throw them away. On the sand. All the drugs. Yeah. Incredible isn't it? They're just irresponsible. They want to be jealous or what? No, they just throw them away. They've injected themselves. This is too much. It's just over the top. Do it Arlene. It's very dangerous. How could they do it like this? No feeling at all. And supposing there are some people from somewhere? Yes, well that's what you can get asked for. But in Sydney, I turned the boat and the children got pinned up. The parents got down two times to be president. Because of all the needles that were plating out on the shore. Even here in Sydney. And you have to clear the playground because the children are there. All these needles are plating out in this storm water. You don't feel cold, as somebody said to me the other day. You feel like you're going to get the point? No, I'm just completely rejected. Let's take this thing. I have to go here. All these crazy things you see are coming out of the mind. It is disturbing. Think of all things which are disturbing. You are not there? No.

Oh, they're pretty good tools too. They're very good tools for you. Light. They're just kind of really good at pouring. I'm sorry, it's not the same as normal dry. But this is really good. It's a bad guy. I'm going to take this. Seven days. And everybody's... ...all good. All right, see you again. No. You want another two? No. It's going to be around the mist. I have to go there. Just under the glass, mother. After me? Just under this glass. This is the left-hand side. It's funny, I look up... ...the traditional... ...the scenario. Yeah, and of course, the feature... ...with David Jones. Yes. Like on the road. Oh, yes. Open up. That's cool. You're on video. Just in time. Now where it is that people stuck up my way to playground. It's over there. Okay. There's one there. Yeah, right there. I have to go. Yes, when I gave, I got them. Actually I gave them to Warren. Thank God he never gave them. I'm surprised. Otherwise they are saying... ...you have to provide lots of carpets. I gave two big carpets also, I think. God knows. One should never do like that. It's a public property. Exactly. I mean, it's really absurd. But when you start making money out of it, then what is it? Most rupes of every country. They do what you like, doesn't it take them much of their free time.

I think he discovered about three years before he went away that he cannot get over this. Yes. And then he was caught in the industry. He thought this nonsense that he was to do. And he had already made money before that. And all kinds of stories he told. He said there was an old lady long time back who he served. So this time when he went to her, she was dead. But her daughter said she has put the money in your name in the bank. Really? All these days he never got any money. I used to pay him hundred to fifty, hundred pounds per month. Plus two, plus staying there and all that. Suddenly I don't know how he got this money he says from her. So he had lots of money. His wife also told me he had lots of money. And she's quite frightened of it. She comes from her, she's a relation of mine. She comes from very good family. But she has revived his life quite a lot I think. On a say basis of barter system. As they are doing now in Russia. They can sell out everything. The people are telling Me that they don't sell it. The photos are reduced. The camera. They already will be turned like and say that. I can see that. I feel very shy. They are not authorized.

Russia has beautiful, is also beautiful. Russia has had a wonderful imperial track. Yeah, real artists. In the late and novice porcelain in the late eight-century. But the trouble is people don't like it here. They are so exuberance in that. So much exuberance. They'll have gold leaf. You see for example, if this they'll have a gold leaf. Finished. Too fussy for English wine. Have you ever seen Fabergé jewellery? Which one? Fabergé. The Russian design. Oh, I have. Yeah, I have some already. Have you? Yeah. What happened once, see, we had gone long time back. We brought something very, very cheap that time. They call it a rose cut diamonds. Beautiful, I mean. Can't imagine. Some my father had, I don't know how he had it. I don't know. Russians used to come very freely before. Then the British were ruling us. And they used to sell their things in India. Now of course nothing is there. A diamond center. They have gone into mafia business. Well, mafia not renowned for their art production, have they? No, they are not. I just don't know.

But they were telling Me about one car. They have called him Ruta or something. Ruta. Big car. So they had. Thank you. And they were, you see, they sold My old car. Which I have bought out of one computer. One computer to sell and get one car. All right, then this car was sold. And in the same price they were getting a big car, a new one. So this lady who went there to buy Slava's wife. She, when she was coming, the mafia was standing outside. They asked money, how can you pay for this car? So at least one-fourth of the price. She said, I have no money. She was wearing My. She said, who is this old man? She said, she's holding mother. Holding mother? What do you do? She said, we have to do it. And your children, they also have to do it. She said, we have such a meeting. She said, you've got a, like a police car, you will call it. And she said, I will pay a single pike. They brought it down to one-fourth. Nobody can control them, they are standing outside, nobody can do it. Money. Not many mafia people round the world negotiate them, do they? Yeah, they do. Because, you see, these are, some of them are Italian. Italian mafia, some there. They are not all Russians. They are taking help from Italians. From Sicily now they have got imported. Imported mafia. This is another side of life. One side is the stupidity, the another side is this kind of violence. But she said, there's no car that can come out of the people. And she was not aware of it. Later on people told us that we are very lucky.

Once happened they had given Me sixteen crowns made out of cardboard but they made very beautiful in Susanna. So these English Sahaja Yogis were bringing them in the buses that they were coming in. So the customs, English customs, often. They said, what do you have in these buses? You can have a look. One by one they took it. There were five people. One opened this one, then passed it to another, then third, then the other. They were just looking at it, you see. They had a brisk agony because they didn't know. Just looking at it. I mean, they were made of cardboard but it had touched My head all right. And ultimately these boys said, now what do you decide? Please take. They had become so docile. All English blood had ran out of them. Please take and give them. And they were standing like this, you know, just like this. So many cars passed through without doing any customs. And they were just enjoying it. I mean, on the customs, the way we have seen things happening at you. Mother, in Australia they did an inquiry on customs in Australia and the professor said that they should abandon it. Just forget it. The customs in Australia, they said they should disband the customs. That's worth it. But you see, the nonsense they play about it.

Once they made Me stay at the parterre boat for three hours. For what? I mean, somebody gave Me a samagri, you know, this hanbaga, haven samagri. They tortured My life. But they knew they were wrong because when I said, all right, what do you want, you do what you like. You want to put a case on Me? Please, do it. I'll be very happy. They didn't do anything. I just can't understand. Ah, they took away all the mangoes there. We didn't know, you see. Somebody should have told us. Three boxes of mangoes they took and they said, you come tomorrow and we'll deliver them back to you. And they all ate it up. Never got. Really? But they should inform people that such a thing happens here. I think they got after us, that's all. I had one horrible thing on My throat, it's excellent, it's worth nothing but it's excellent. They took it away from us in a hurry. Hurry was carried. They were not saints, nothing, they were groups. But they took it away. I came in from a medendag and I bought some curry powder which was being marketed by some ladies, who call themselves the country mums, this is in Maharashtra. Anyway, when I came through the customs, the curry powder bags had broken and my whole luggage was filled with curry powder. Then what did you do? So I took it through the declaration and they just opened it up and looked at it and threw it at Me. Everywhere the customs are different, it's so surprising. And you have to declare if you have more than five hundred dollars. Five hundred dollars, can you imagine? Five hundred dollars is what, nothing? So last time they troubled Me for the gold card, so I brought the cash this time. Then they said, no, here you have to declare, I said, please. Perhaps. In India there's not so much problem, not so many. When you people come you just walk in, there's no problem.

But I had four dogs in London. They came all papers, everything done and then they came, arrived at the airport Delhi. Some stupid fellow was there and he said, no, you can't report them because you have to take a permission from the Commerce Department. And Rommel and Sadha had gone, they came back, they said, now where do we go to this Commerce Department? And the dogs were starving there. I said, why didn't you go and see this Rana fellow who is the deputy collector of customs? He said, we don't know him and I said, it's all right. And by the time they went there the dogs were brought home. So what happened? He said, somebody saw Kalka, uh..Sarna and Rommel there and they went and found out that Mataji's dogs are coming. The news was out in the airport and Mr. Rana immediately went there and saw to it that the dogs were brought out and sent home. While these people said the dogs are gone somewhere, they came back and said, I hear. Especially Delhi and Bombay airports are very good for Saturdays, very good. Even I think Madras is good and this time I tried this Alkatha airport when I reached there. I saw a car with a red light and said, the minister must be travelling with Me. I came down looking for the minister. I said, now the minister. So it was a car for Me. That was too much. I said, it's not allowed anywhere. You have to carry your car up to the airport. But in Russia always they bring a big limousine for Me. I don't know how they manage.

You must come to Russia. That's very important. See, if you are interested in the permittances and all that, you can see. It's very simple to do that. And I have a house there, no? I didn't tell you the story of My house there. But one fellow whom I cured of his heart, he wanted to go to Israel. He was a Jew. But he had a heart trouble. So I cured his heart. He said, I want to donate this house to you Mother. I said, I'll not take donation. Whatever is the market price I'll pay. He found out it was only two thousand pounds. He said, you give me in London. I said, all right, I'll raise that. And for two thousand pound I got it. And then the Sahaja Yogi so sweetly I said, that's such a good work. They have very good carvers. I'll go there in August, Russia. May God bless you! Very soft. Right heart we got. Right heart. This kind would cost in London about hundred and twenty five dollars. It's cheaper here. It's cheaper, yes. Thank you very much. Thank you.

I'm happy you enjoyed all the program and we have to be very thankful to the Turkish collective. They organized everything so well that I don't know what more could be done. We all have come from different countries, here gathered together. The wonderful feeling I have of such peace and joy that you people are from such different countries, following different methods of life, have suddenly come together under one tree of Sahaja Yoga and you all are enjoying it so much.

Especially people from Africa, I was amazed how they were enjoying everything. It was really remarkable. But they are very rhythmic people, they are extremely rhythmic. That rhythm I could see clearly how they were going on for hours together. It is not easy to say anything at this point because, tomorrow I have to give you another lecture at the Pusha trial. But it shows that the whole world can become one. One day, a day might come when all of us who are belonging to different countries, different religions and all that and fighting, they'd all come round under a peacefully domain of Sahaja Yoga. I'm sure it will happen.

So tomorrow we are going to have a Pusha with heart of six o'clock or five o'clock. How will it suit you, five o'clock or six o'clock? We'll have it at six. For all of you it would be a great blessing and it's such a joy-giving thing for me to see people from so many different countries and also mostly they are from Islamic countries. To see this I feel so hopeful that we can say in Islamic countries now who are just fighting and quarrelling and killing each other. Such stupidity is there which can be saved and once it happens I'm sure all the blessings of the Divine will fall on you. You have to forget all this nonsense. I was happy to see that a person from Israel, Oleg, was dancing before these people who are supposed to be Muslims.

So you see one day this will come that there will be no such stupid religions which will make you fight but which will make you love. Religion is for love and also for brotherhood, not for fighting. This is such a blessing I feel myself that we are here of so many different countries and such a lot of joy and happiness. May God bless you. Tomorrow I hope you'll make it possible to come for kunja but six o'clock we'll start. I don't know where I'm heading.

And she has the right to be with the children. She has the right to be with the girls. But you some of the children. The baby will be nice. She doesn't want anything. She's fallen. If you leave the family with the children's father, what children do with us, they are coming from world-class children. They suddenly get this stupid feeling. It's called a little interaction. A lot of people always want to see. That's the thing. My friends have come here. You know there is a country where people live in the heat also. I do live in complete cold. What happened to the big dream you had It's like this only a month ago. Yeah. Careful, Charlie. Water it.

I think you should take off the seat. You are going to take off. Is the problem lost? You are just for a few minutes. You are saying that why you take off your boot out? You can't do this here, but I think you can. You take it out, you are going to pass. I can keep you off the top and you will be good. So, we will be able to insert the microphone here. Yes. Someone is waiting this time. No, see to it, only waiting this. Why? Because already people have started coming there in India. There are 500 dialysis. Have you met? I have not met. Thank you. You are welcome. I am here.

What do you mean Americans will do the work? They will work with them. There are connections on America. And the gentleman who is elected now. We, who are rode Baltic individuals. You are Chinese, and we have in some countries. China is using plug into the electricity... and young people are in the movement of something new. Young people are born there, lived there. And the challenge is we have to protect the dedication is to make friends and be young people. Why? Don't focus yet. Don't worry. So many people are moving. I'm not a single guy. I'm a little... I'm a very single guy. But also, people come from out there, here. But you have to stay, sit, stay inside the bus for a while. Don't think they all listen to you. Please, let us know. We all listen. We take enough time. Take it. You can sit on that baby. You can have a open house. Don't you get hurt from that. Good.

I'm going to take my picture. You see the bus. You see a dress on the floor there. That's baby. Good. I think we came very much to appreciate you. Let's see, I want to mention because I've come apart. I think all the people are interested in it. They feel it. And I think you'll feel this one. It's done. I have a question. When all those who have come they now bring their father to the family. But they don't have any family. Yes. Excuse me. So, you see these things are made out of clay or wood. So much pleasure. How can they come? You see that? All of these things. You know, she's a pretty girl. And I'm such a man. I'm talking to a baby. Well, I know. I'm a baby. I'm a doctor. But that's the help of you people too. You know that?

Mr. Ted Wilson, I don't know what you think about this anymore. There are questions in the room. I don't know what you want. So, what are the things you're looking for? Where? I don't see what I would have found. You're a baby. What's that? I don't know. I think it's very good. I'm sure I'll be fine. But something has opened up. And I can't tell you. I don't see it. And, what are you looking for? You see? You're looking for a baby. There. You don't see it. See if you can find it. I will show you. Very nice. You can see.

There are cars and so on. Don't ask. Try. It's not that good.

Yes, and they ask the whole system to be treated as to be awakened as in their heart, as I have received from and they also work it out, is what they've seen there. Yes. Once you get it out of it, you also have to see the ama and once you modernize your problems, you can share all of your issues and you become certain that nothing that you may don't do is going to be much better. So, that's the concern that we have. We will be close to no death and the crisis of death is the hope of peace. I don't agree with that. I think that's a good thing. Thank you. Any more questions? I think we need to share something that is good for us. Now, we need to get out of here. We will go here. This one will be for you. The one that you see will see and then you will see. This one is a challenge. You can't see. Please. We can't see. Please. I will take you to the other side. One more if you have done with the mountain. Our namata will be in the middle now.

Today's performance was really beyond. I was the man. Another performance. Take the baby out otherwise I won't be able to speak. What's the matter? It was a very rare opportunity that we had such a master here. I must say that first time I heard him, I felt that this santoor which I never used to equate it to other instruments is par excellence. Much more. Because in santoor the melody is not so much achieved melody. Means the continuation of swaras in santoor. Like in other instruments we have in India. But when I heard this great master, not only the melody but also it represents the beauty of Kashmir value. I have been to Kashmir and I just felt that the ripples of the river, the echo of the surroundings where there are lots of beautiful hills and also mountains. All that is expressed in this instrument. But the melody part of it he has brought it. It's a melodious thing. First I used to think it is little bit lacking in melody because it breaks. But the way he has connected the whole thing, all the swaras and everything is why really I am very much grateful to him for doing this very very intricate and also very subtle thing. And that is how this instrument one day will become a very very important instrument. My all congratulations to him. Thanks to him for coming here. Actually Baba mama has found him and he told me he is a great master. So I really saw that in Delhi. And here you have seen how Indian music is so leading, so beautiful. You cannot explain how it supersedes all other music. Because it is the creativity of the artist at that moment with the rapport with the people who are listening. It's not already made, composed or anything. So the intellect doesn't play part at all. It's just you are beyond the intellect in thoughtless awareness and then you play. So Indian music has this speciality that it is not composed, it is not premeditated, it is not thought of or it is belonging to one person. But it is something that anybody who is a master can create his own melody. Of course there are certain rules, regulations for the melodies, no doubt. But that is just to make the melody very beautiful and extremely, extremely I should say musical. These rules and regulations are there. But you don't feel anything like bound into something. And the freedom of your flight is so easily assimilated into your temperament that you don't even feel that it's a particular raga you are listening to or whether you are going out of the raga, nothing. You just flow with it. Now this raga, Jog raga I have heard from a very famous sitarist gentleman long time back. When I told his debut that I have heard Jog from this particular gentleman, he said, when was it? I said at least 30 years back. He said, then it's alright. Nowadays he is in a drunken state so you can't hear anything. So this is another tragedy if the musicians who are very good, excellent take to all these horrible things and then the music is lost. It is really a spiritual thing and because of that you must understand that spirituality requires purity of temperament. If you don't have that purity this will be lost in no time. And this is what is happening in our country. I think one side is an attack from the western musicians who are bringing pop and this and that and very cheap type of western music. Not the classical that the way we heard and then that music overlaps the Indian music which is definitely is very subtle and you have to have a subtle mind to enjoy it. Now he was quite happy to see that you though you are from the western countries are enjoying Indian music. So I said now they all have become very subtle that's why they are enjoying. And this subtlety has come to us because of the spirit that is giving you the light. In the spirit of spirit's light you see the subtler side of everything, especially music. And music is one thing I have seen which carries also vibrations, which spreads vibrations, which takes out vibrations from my body. That's why I am very particular that we should have always some music whenever we have any program, any we can say any lecture. Just a lecture is not sufficient. You have to have some music with it so the flow of the vibrations is there. Now today it was really so remarkable the whole thing I must say that normally sitting for such a long time my legs just become absolutely full of vibrations I can't even walk. But vibrations started flowing and I am feeling very much better now. Now on tabla what you heard today is also another very remarkable thing is also the rhythm which we say is coming from Shri Shiva. It is the Shankara's whole system vibrates into rhythmic patterns. And we have so many rhythmic patterns and the way they are played is really also another very subtle thing. Now the gentleman you know him as Namdari they call it, Shabapu Namdari Katha. As Namdari is the gentleman who I think is a prodigy, he is a child and he is really remarkable because I have heard so many people playing tabla. And he reminds me of very very great tabla players which I have seen long time back. Now they are no more. There is some sort of an inheritance maybe from his previous birth, maybe I don't know what. But at such a young age he has such a controlled, such a system, such a rhythm and also understanding of the one who is playing with him to join and to play according to the need of the melody. So the whole combination was very very wonderful and the day of Sahastrara being celebrated with such a beautiful music is really very remarkable and blissful. Apart from that I must tell all the Sahaja Yogis who have brought really international music tonight for all of you and you all enjoyed it. I know that Austria is known for its music very much and also Germans are root for their music. But today I saw people also from other places, for example Romania and other places who had joined in this combined orchestra. All everything, all the program was done with great understanding and with great, I should say perfection. I couldn't find fault anywhere. Only thing I enjoyed every part of it and enjoyed the way you were enjoying it. So may God bless you all and hope tomorrow we will have the puja. I think two o'clock will be alright for you because by now you will all go off to sleep. Two o'clock tomorrow will be alright. But I would like to meet the leaders about eleven o'clock myself. Thank you very much. Good night.

This was really a very memorable night for all of you. I don't know what to say about Nishakka. I think he should be given now the title of Ustadh, no doubt about it. The way he has played, I have never heard anybody playing so well, never before. And specially Tapa. Because it's a very difficult, I have never heard anyone playing Tapa on sitar. Once only, Sideshwari Devi, as I told you, she sang before me this Tapa Rang. She was quite an old lady at that time. But I was amazed. She sang it so well. She was a master. And I also call her, you are an Ustadh, I call her that. That's what I feel now today, the way you have really entertained all of them. Also they appreciate and understand music. That's the best part of it. You see, all these people who are sitting here, I know them. You would have played till 5, 6 o'clock, they would have sat here. It's a present to them. For they are serving a great purpose. My father was a great Kannaiya and supporter of musicians. And always used to say, you must always respect artists because they are specially chosen by God. If they don't go to the wrong path, then they have to be very much respected and must do everything that is possible to express your respect. So one day he told me, my desire is that the whole world should know about our classical music. That's all I want. Because this is our greatest sampada. It means the property? Heritage and the property. Inherited property of our country. And no country has this. This is something so great. And this should be used to convey the blessings of God. Also I have seen vibrations flow much better when there is music on. With the music so many vibrations start just, it's like some puja or aarti, I don't know what it is, but music has this power. So this was his desire and I also found that for Sahaja Yoga our Indian music is going to help a lot. Now all kinds of music styles are coming up, but I have seen once they hear the Indian music they don't want to hear anything else. That is for definite. But there have been some very great composers, no doubt. But the way these days the music is on, I think the speedy music as you have played today will really break their heads and they'll understand what Indian music is. I was very happy that you could come because these musicians mostly come in Guru Puja. So they must also have somebody here of your repute of your great achievements before them and to hear them in this atmosphere. But today definitely something had happened to you, I think much more than before. And as you told me that in My presence something happens to you, I could see that today very much. I hope your fingers are not cut. They are all right. So this is how we understand each other better. Now when music is played we forget all our boundaries, all our stupid ideas, just become one with each other. Music is really some divine gift and it should be always encouraged very much. I have to also congratulate the hosting countries of Italy and also of India that in such a short time they have done so well about this building up, this new place and new thing. Very well done, I must thank them very much for this. Otherwise in such a short time to do it. In Guru Puja always it happens like that. We bought a new house just on Guru Poornima. We lived it here and everything works out on Guru Puja, some or other that something has to happen. Like Kabela also I bought five days before Guru Puja. Second day I bought, third day I paid and fifth day the program was here. So this time also same thing. In Guru Puja time there is something special that you go to something better and have some sort of a big activity and that has happened and I must congratulate Italians, also Indians. I don't know how much Indians have contributed to that. But their music is there. And also the way you had the drama like professionals, very good drama and all the programs also very very good. Sicilians very very good with their music. I enjoyed that music very much. And also all other programs that you had of say Kuchipuri is amazing that people from western countries should do Kuchipuri so well. It's a very fast, very fast dance, very fast dance. And another did Bharatanatyam and all these things to be done by people from western countries is remarkable I think and so well. I mean I can't understand how is the nucleus has shifted from India to western countries. Now our Indian girls are not learning these dances and you are becoming such experts. Something special is happening in the west I think that you all have picked up all these things. It's very creditable that you understand also Indian music because it's a very difficult thing to understand and to appreciate. And a new audience we have to prepare for this understanding of this music very important. In our country nowadays people are not so serious about classical music but if it goes back from western countries they'll start appreciating. So I hope you all have enjoyed all the music and everything and tomorrow is the puja. I think we can start at about seven tomorrow it's all right if you can all be awake. In the morning I would like to see about say twelve o'clock people whom I have to give some money and who I'll send word for them who have to see me. But otherwise Monday morning I'll be free if you want to come and see me. I hope you are all not very sleepy and you go and enjoy now. The morning is already there and the moon must be shining. The moon was on the ninth there was the Guru Puja really Guru Purnima but according to our convenience we have had this. I'm very happy really very happy because all these things are coming up at the end of the century. Now this picture you have shown here behind is the picture that this scientist has talked about that these are all the vibrations coming out of mother's body that she has infinite source she's the source of the divine and cosmic power she said so. But actually sitting in the heart of the universe is not this one is another one when in London they were singing the song sitting in the heart of the universe all kinds of all hearts you know all designs of heart came with light and that is what should have been under this or change the other one one of the two would be better idea. So I mean this also very unique that I met this scientist there and the scientist really I felt very shy about the whole thing he was describing me as the source of cosmic energy and he's verified it with all kinds of equations and geometry and also algebra which I have studied long time back but I was amazed at this man the way he reached the conclusion. Of course you know that but that if scientifically it is proved then we'll have no problem and this is a very big thing also this Guru Puja this has happened. So tomorrow we'll have the Puja about seven o'clock I'll be here. Thank you very much. Good night. Thank you. Mr. Middha from Austria. Can you please come to the stage? This is a question for the Italians. The dinner will be served in about 15 minutes in the usual place.

This light is Shri Mataji's Dud projected by M. She mother is saying that we have all become one, totally integrated. As you know this was written by Namo deva about six hundred years ago, and even then He was asking the awakening of the mother Kundalini. Even today you're asking the awakening of the mother Kundalini. Yes, she mother. You know today's program with the abhanga Zohar. This has been composed by Santa Soka, Mirajee. You see in India we have different families for music, like kirana karana, Agra karana, all kinds of karanas we have. The specialty of Maharashtra is not a sandwich, it is the music that they sing in the dramas, in the plays you have heard her singing. So all the time the actor is standing and singing, actress is standing and singing, they have to remember by heart everything and it's a very fast number always. It's not easy to sing those songs, so I've requested her to at least sing one song from not a sangeet because that's the essence of Maharashtrian music. Sure I must remember and Rukmini's song.

Dear friends, I have no words in which I can express our thank you to Shri Mataji for giving us a chance to come here and perform on this auspicious occasion. I also render our thanks to the organizers for looking after us so well. Thank you once again.

After this great music program, I don't know what to say in words. But I must say they are all sahaja yogis. They have come to sahaja yoga. They have got their realization and all these great artists are now coming to sahaja yoga so easily. They are our family, and the closeness we feel for them you can see it in the music. Even if you don't understand the words, the way you see they penetrate into your being because they are sahaja yogis. Also the songs they have chosen were very remarkable and beautiful. I really don't know how to thank them, they are my children. I don't know what to say but the only thing I say is that you should continue with your music and all my blessings. Not only that, but I would do anything to spread this music all over the world. We have now such an audience, such a musical audience you can see that, and such a report was established. It shows that this divine music will be eternal and spreading all over. May God bless you all, the listeners and also the musicians.

I will ask the ninja to make way for the next artist. Shri Mataji wants to say something.

What a treat. I mean, you see these seem to be some very elderly musicians who are born again, no doubt. Even when they are playing, you know, they remind you of so many great artists I have heard about and also I have seen them, how seriously with what dignity they are playing at this young age. He's only 17 years of age, just imagine. And this is what I say, in this yoga bhumi of India such geniuses are going to be born, such prodigies. I told you I saw about ten children five to ten years of age singing, playing things. I was amazed. So we don't mind any population growth in India if such people are going to come. These are definitely prodigies no doubt, but they are great incarnations, I think. Otherwise at this young age, you see, such a difficult rock, as it is Indian music is so very difficult. And to master it, to compose it and to play it so beautifully is an impossible situation. How they have done it is all divine, and I think the Kutha Yuga is working so well that we are getting such children in this country. I wish every country gets such children. As to a mother it's a great Kautu, guys, you understand Kautu, so proud of my children, so beautiful. And I pray that in every country we should have such prodigies born. There are so many waiting to be born, you can see it in them that they are not children. They are grown-ups, very well developed and balanced, very dignified elderly people you see. So actually we have to bow to them, the way they are musicians. Tremendously all my best wishes to Dananjaya and I'm really amazed that is working. We have been seeing one better than the other but this one was really remarkable. May God bless you.

She is really known to be a very intelligent good girl, and I remember I went to her house, I remember the flat in which they were staying and she just asked me a question, I don't know if she remembers, she said, what should I do for life? I said for life, you should live. That's all. I mean the red tree, a very interesting story is asked as to how I came to know so Nana Angie. She had come to Nagpur and she had her batch mates in the income tax department, and the income tax department is ignorant as they are, they thought that Baba mama could accompany her on the tabla. And when I saw her I immediately knew that she is of the very top class and then I had requested Sandesh's father to accompany her and then there's another gentleman and for that, she has been so grateful to me for this little gesture, but I can tell you that I am a fan right from the day we met and I continue to be too, and I'm very proud to say so.

Thank you. Namaskar. It gives me great pleasure to get this opportunity to dance before her and such a wonderful audience. May I heartily congratulate you on this auspicious occasion. And may I also express my gratitude to you for giving me this opportunity and your blessings. I found your blessings. I began with a Vishnu bandhana. I would now like to do a few rhythmic patterns, Othan, Amal, Tore, Tukri in Kathak. Kathak, which was born in the temples of northern central India, is over 2,000 years old. The tradition of the Kathakars, namely the storytellers, is continued till today, whereby the reciters recited the story and narrated it through dance. That tradition still continues, where we dancers recite and dance, whether it's the rhythmic pattern or the expressional pieces. A few Othan, Amal, Tore, Tukri.

The Jhula, the swing, though of course it's not the mausam, the season for the swing, but nonetheless the bahar is there and hence the swing of the heart. It's a piece based on the pattern of the swing known as the Jhula parang. Footwork. A pattern of six in a rhythm of four. I cooled down and I did six, Shakil did a pattern of seven. I'd like to do that pattern of seven. There's a lot of spontaneity and upaj, creativity within the dance form. It has not been rehearsed, it has not been planned. So since Shakil answered my six with a seven, I would like to do the same seven with him.

I have specially drawn out one item for this evening. But before I do that, I would like to do one piece, an expression of peace, which is quite different from the one which I would like to dedicate to you. The piece that I would like to do before is on Yashodhara. This is a piece based on the feelings and life of Yashodhara, the wife of Lord Buddha. We all know about Lord Buddha, but how many of us have given a thought to his wife, Yashodhara, what she went through and her sacrifice? Prince Siddharth goes out into the kingdom where he sees the old man, the leper and the corpse, and he's filled with dismay. He decides to seek enlightenment by renouncing his home. He leaves his wife sleeping and goes out into the forest. When Yashodhara gets up in the morning and sees that Siddharth is not there, she looks for him in vain, and finally she tells her maid, "My friend, he could have told me before going." She says it's a matter of pride that he's gone to seek enlightenment, but the fact he left home without telling me, that has hurt me the most. She says, as the wife of Arashput, it is my duty to adorn him and send him to the war front from when no one knows whether he'll return. My friend, if I can do that, don't you think I would have allowed him to go for meditation? Years pass and one day she hears that Buddha is returning home. Her heart fills with joy when she sees him at her doorstep. She says, but alas, Buddha stands before her, not as a husband, but as the holy man seeking arms. Yashodhara tells him that when you left home, I lost everything. I have nothing left with me except our little son, Rahul. She calls Rahul and donates him to his father as ours. Rudham Sharanam Gachabi. Yashodhara is left all alone after making this sacrifice. This is a piece taken from the epic of the same name written by our famous poet, Maithili Sharan Gaut. And it has been set to music by Pandit Jawala Prasad. Rudham Sharanam Gachabi. Buddha, Shatternam Gachabi. Thum Thum, Shatternam Gachabi. Samgam, Shatternam Gachabi.

I would like to share one. When I was speaking to Aradhana and Sanjayji a short while ago, I wanted to do a special item this evening. I must say that I got initiated into the Sahaj Yoga that day. When they were explaining to me about the awakening of the Kundalini, and they showed me the diagram. Looking at the diagram, the concept of flute came into my mind. The two veins going up and the points in between were like the holes in the heart of the flute. Taking that as the inspiration and the balance between the left and the right, we thought of taking the balance of mankind. I have spread it out a little more. The flute is the symbol, that simple bamboo, from which emanates the purest of sound. It's like the voice coming from within the heart. And the balance that is to be maintained, we decided to take the Vaishnism and the Sufism philosophy and the balance between the two. Bihari, Surdas have talked about the flute. Maulana Jamaluddin Rumi has talked about the flute. Wherein he says, "Bishnu asni chu hai kaayat mi kunath as judayi hosh kaayat mi kunath." Listen to the plaintive notes of the flute, wailing the pangs of separation. "Seena kha him shere hai shere hai asfira, ta ba goyim shere hai dar de ishtia." May I apologize for my terrible Persian accent? I'm trying to speak the other way but of course it's a terrible accent but pardon. In which he says, that just like the heart of the flute is pierced, so is my heart pierced with the sound emanating from the flute. The same sentiment has been expressed by Surdas and Bihari. "Murli bhai ghan shaam tan manadhan. Abubakai tum dhoore karavati. Jaake basse bhai nandanandana." Rumi goes on to say, "Harkara jaama zesh ki chaak shud, Izo hirso jumla aibhi paak shud, shaad bash ishkhush saudai ma, ita bhi bhi jumla illa thai ma." Where he says, that just as we remove our soiled clothes and clean ourselves, similarly the sound of the flute cleanses us of all our impurities. If this be my madness of love for the flute, then long live this madness of love for the pure sound of the flute which cleanses us of all our impurities. This idea of the flute came to me when I was talking to Aradhana ji and Sanjay ji and when they were explaining the whole concept of the awakening of the Kundalini and when I saw the diagram. I dedicate this to you, Mataji. Aradhana ji ishkhush saudai ma, ita bhi jumla illa thai ma, shaad bash ishkhush saudai ma, ita bhi jumla aibhi paak shud. Bhasuki bhasuri indri dhanushya chabi hoti.

Vishnu asane chum ikayat mikunat. Ayse jadai se oh, shikayat mikunat. Vena kahim sharai sharai azhifira. Mure le bhai karne shaam. Tan manan tanne. Abhavakkot tumen ture karavati. Jake bhase bhai nandenan tanne. Ese phage rehet hajasu. Sahil rati ke se tumanare. Sura shaam hai sabni bhi saari. O ka se yog jate bi saari. Ahe kare dhama jeshi. Jaka krishute. O zehir so jumaila e bhi bhakushte. Shat bhaje eishku kushu sadaima. Eeta bhi bhejunga. Ilate hai ma.

I'd now like to ask Tulsiji to say or Shakil Bhai to say a tukra or a parang which I do not know. This was a piece recited by Tulsiji which I have not heard before but it is about, the description is about Krishna on the banks of the Yamuna dancing. The Natak root of Krishna. I was wondering whether I should do a gat bha from the Mahabharata Draupadi Chirharat. We all are familiar with the story. I'd like to do a small gat bha, story being told without words only through the use of hand gestures, expressions and body movements. I don't think I'll repeat the story because I think all of you are familiar with it.

And for the finale, a bit of footwork. The sound of the thunder, the darkly clouds and the rain.

Shri Rabindranath Tagore, he was a great seer and he saw the future and he described this meeting of ours in Ganpati Pulay. So he says, they will sing it in Bangla language but I am just translating, On the shores of Bharat where men of all races have come together, Bharat is India, away O my mind, standing here with outstretched arms, outstretched arms, I send My salutations to the God of humanity and in solemn chant sing His praises, at whose call no one's nose came floating streams of men and merged into the sea of Bharat. The Aryan, the non-Aryan, the Dravidians, the Hians, the Patans and the Mughals, they all have merged into one body. Today the West has opened its doors and from thence come gifts, giving and taking. See how it is described. All will be welcome on the shores of Bharat where men of all races have come together. In mad exultation, singing songs of victory, have they come, crossing deserts and mountains, they all dwell within Me and in My blood echo their varied melodies, O terrible one. Let the heavens resound with your music, even those whom in disdain we kept apart will gather round thee, O Bharat, where men of all races have come together. Here one day in the hearts of men the message of the one resounded in the file of the pasyas, all differences forgotten and the many forged into one. Round that fire of sacrifice we all have to meet with bowed heads and unite on the shores of Bharat where men of all races have come together. In that fire the bloodshot flame of suffering in aglow, O mind bear this suffering and hear the call of the one, conquer all shame, all fear and let all humiliations vanish. What great life will emerge at the end of the days of suffering. The night ends, the great Mother is awake. Now you see the way He described it, what we had to go through during slavery, that forget all that. At the end of the day of suffering the night ends, the great Mother is awake on the shores of Bharat where men of all races have come together. Come O Aryan and non-Aryan, Hindu and Muslim, come O English and you Christians, come O Brahmins, purify your mind and clasp the hands of all, come O downtrodden and let all hundreds of your humiliation vanish. Tarry not but come you all to anoint the Mother on the shores of Bharat where men of races have come together.

Russians, I found them to be extremely open-hearted people, very open, very humble, extremely humble. And they didn't have all the conditionings we have in the so-called democracy. Because in democracy perhaps we had too much time to go on choosing things and discarding things and our ego was very much built up. And I'll do My level best to see that we come to Sahaja Yoga, we take people to Sahaja Yoga. But she thought that now it's a terminating point of communism and after this we have to jump into something higher and not into the same thing into which the democratic countries are existing somehow. I didn't tell her that how this catholic church has made slaves out of all the democratic countries and also other Christian churches have done it. They are not even aware, so many people are not even aware that they have become slaves of that. This, you see, I think in a way they are saved very much compared to other democratic people, very much saved from the conditionings, from the choices, from materialism, so many things they are saved that they, as soon as they saw Sahaja Yoga they jumped into it. That's why we have thousands and thousands of people there. Lenin also had said that he believed in a stateless state and that is the stateless state we are going to have now in Sahaja Yoga. Of course he could not explain what he was saying and moreover he was forced by his party to say things which were not his own, whatever it is. But spiritually they are going to be extremely strong and those who are spiritually strong are always blessed much more than anybody else. They are the people who can really lead the world one day in spirituality because our ego is too much. And this ego business has gone to such an extent that we don't even see how we are slave of that ego. Also how the one who pampers our ego, how he makes a slave out of us. Anybody who pampers our ego we feel we are very great. And we can never find out our faults once we start thinking we are something very great. That is what is exactly not there. They are so introspective, they are so humble. Even if I said you have achieved so much and they said Mother it's such a lot to be achieved. Anything you say to them, they are very humble people and their darkness whatever they may call it, but thank God they were protected. Also in the West as you see now, everything all enterprises they enter into is self-destructive. All kinds of things that they are doing are nothing but self-destructive. Right from say pollution, right from the way they are now making the children here, making the social life, the family life, all in a mess. It's all devastating. And they are not aware of it, that's the best part of it. They are so egoistic that they are not aware of it. So we have to understand that this ego business which has crawled into the West is like a kind of a big detrimental, it's very detrimental to their spiritual growth. Now how to combat this ego? This only way is to raise their Kundalini. There is no other way out because unless and until you raise their Kundalini, how can you show that you have got ego? Then they'll come to Me and say, Mother my Agnya is catching, of course, but that's different. But this ego is, they will not see till they have got their realization. And the whole, I feel Russians are very wise people, this wisdom which is the blessings of Shri Ganesha. They too are having free love, they are allowed to have free love. But despite that, that's not their style of life. In their everyday life they are very family oriented, very faithful to their wives, faithful to their husbands. They are, this not become their lifestyle as it has become. They don't have these things so openly and they don't discuss things like this and they don't abuse their children, they don't have all these problems that we have here. So all our self-destructive things that came to us are coming from our ego, is our ego itself is killing us. What's wrong? What's wrong in getting AIDS? Nothing wrong. What's wrong in dying? Nothing wrong. What's wrong in suffering? Nothing wrong. Only thing is that it is stupid, that's all. And see, on the contrary is America. In America we have hardly hundred sahaja yogis altogether in the whole of that big thing. Now what is happening there? The other day I read there is a fire in the east coast. First they had a big earthquake, then they had a big riot. Now there is a fire burning which may go on till 11 days more and 65,000 acres of land is under, hectares of land is under fire, already finished. So the nature also, you see, strikes to make you learn. Now there's one big tornado which is still crawling up. It has finished one country, Morgan City, it's still crawling up. God knows it might go to New York or something, they are quite worried about. I was trying to avert it. They are showing it, moving like that. And already one typhoon has hit Miami. And you should see the pictures, I mean the whole thing is all on the ground. All that, Miami is finished. So now there are no sahaja yogis. If they were sahaja yogis it would never have happened. Always like this when they were big, these dinosaurs and all those big, big animals and they started destroying the smaller animals, it was hit by some sort of a steroid I think or maybe some sort of a star and they all were killed. All those big, big animals were killed and the smaller animals came up. So that is what it is, that nature will hit such people, first of all. If they don't learn lesson even after that, then this is the last judgment. India people have suffered a lot under domination of people like Stalin and communism also in a way. But still the way now the Western country is going to suffer, they have, I have no even imagination to think what sufferings are going to come. Because in this Kali Yuga now, this Krita Yuga has started. And the Krita Yuga has the speciality that you have to pay for what you have done. What you call is a karma phala, whatever you have done, the fruit of your karmas you have to do, that's why. Secondly it will expose all falsehood, Krita Yuga only. So all these people will be exposed. So many things happened since the Krita Yuga has started since My birth. In these seventy years you see how many things have happened in this world. Never in the history of this world so many things happened in such a short time. And everything is boiling up, coming up. We have to learn one thing from Russians is this, they are extremely sincere people. They are not materialistic at all, not selfish. What they want is nothing but ascent in Sahaja Yoga. When there was a coup I asked them, aren't you worried there's a coup in your country? No Mother, we are not in this country, we are in the Kingdom of God. They know they are in the Kingdom of God, but in the West not so. All the time they know they are in the Kingdom of God, they are just enjoying themselves. And this is what we Sahaja Yogis have to learn from them. I mean of course I don't know how they have recognized Me also, this shows their sensitivity to spirituality, that's all. Only by seeing My face they know I am something. And then after knowing Me or whatever it is coming to Sahaja Yoga, there's no doubt for them at all, it's so much identified. This is what we have to understand. And our styles are such that we never introspect. We should introspect. Are we doing something to pamper these entrepreneurs? I also heard surprisingly that because we lost this case, I mean you know that it was all wrong, it was no justice, nothing, but it was nice we lost the case. The lower courts were in the higher courts, we can fight it. Some Sahaja Yogis from Austria said that, you see we don't know what is it. When I heard this I said, now please tell them do you get out of Sahaja Yoga. There's no place in the heavens for such half-baked people. If you have no faith in yourself, better get out of it. You have no idea as to how much people have suffered in the name of God before. Even the Christians who were gnostics, they were tortured, they were beaten up, they were troubled so much, but they did not utter a word. You have seen the picture that day I showed you of Shankaracharya. If you say Sant Gyaneshwara, all of these saints have suffered so much, you have suffered nothing, but if you think that in Sahaja Yoga everything is going to be the bed of roses, not. If the magistrate is stupid, you can't help it. If there is no law in a place, you can never win. But it will show there is no law, there's no legal sense these people have. Then you have to fight for it, you have to find out. You are here to establish the truth. If there's untruth, because there is untruth and that is troubling you and if you want to think that Sahaja Yoga, how can it be, then all right. Sahaja Yoga is not meant for mediocre, neither for arrogant. It is not. Somehow they'll all drop out. So be careful. What we need is quality, not quantity. But we have such a lot of quantity and quality in Russia and all these Eastern blocks. What we need are human beings and don't you think so? So all the Sahaja Yogis who are here from the West have to understand that you introspect yourself. Where were you and where have you come? Just now as he said, we were in darkness. They were in the darkness of the left side, you were in the darkness of the right side, of your ego. And an egoistic person will never introspect. So you have to find out what is wrong with us, what are we doing, are we all right or not. Because in Sahaja Yoga ascent is the only essence of Sahaj line. You have to rise higher and higher and higher and for that one has to introspect. Not to condemn oneself but introspect and see for yourself. I was really amazed but I tell you even Chinese are like that. I've seen Chinese, very humble, extremely humble people. Now their government is not all right. They're extremely humble people and if they take to Sahaja Yoga it will really become a great nation again. Both these countries are really remarkably very spiritual. They're very deep and they care for spirituality, nothing else. Of course there are people about thirty percent you can call of a very low level type as we have here also very. But the percentage of low level people is much more in the West than in all these countries where it was a community. We have not matured at all. Very few people have matured. Very few people are really seekers. Very few people are sincere. And now it is the testing ground. We have to see how far we can. Imagine in Talyati we have twenty two thousand Sahaj Yogis, very serious Sahaj Yogis. In the whole of Europe I don't think we have so many. So now for Sahaj Yogis it is important to work it out. The way they spread out. From Siberia people came to see Me. I was there for one day, from Siberia all the way. Thousands of My's they came to see Me. I was there only for one day. You can imagine what sort of a relationship they have with the Divine. With children, old ladies, they came all the way from Siberia. So now it is not that you have to spend time or you have to spend money, but what you have to do is to have a deeper and deeper understanding about Sahaja Yoga. Also that should not be an understanding which is mental, but in thoughtless awareness you have to just get into that deeper being where you understand that Sahaja Yoga is the only solution. Not only for you but for the whole world. And you are born at a time where it is really very dynamic, very dynamic time. And one has to work it out with that anger. All right? Part of tomorrow's lecture I have given today only. So give a hand to the Russians and to the Eastern world. I think it would be now cold enough for you people tomorrow to start the program early. It's already done now. You can start say, the musicians can come seven to nine, is it better? Or you'll have your food first and then come here. So you see we have got the children's program, this, that. So that will take at least two hours. So you'll first have their program and then Rajam's program. And after that we can have dinner. You are real sahaja yogis who are not bothered about food at all. May God bless you. We made some drink for the liver patient. It's very cold just now. I don't know if you'd like to take it or not. It should not harm your throat. All right, try. He's the... They have liked it. You want to have, you can have now only. It's an appetizer.

Just now you have heard all these four artists. The first one is an Australian. I only know his surname but I don't know his name. What is his name? Nick. Nick. Right. So his name is Nick and I heard him before also but this instrument that he plays, I have never heard anybody play classical Indian music with that. I think must be very difficult to play with that particular saxophone that you have seen but how he's made it because Indian music is all melodious and it cannot be played in parts and I was amazed how he managed it and another thing which has really enamored me about him is this that my father had a great desire to spread our Indian classical music all over the world and he said if you spread this music then all kinds of music which are not music but are noises will vanish and so people should know this classical music then they can play any other music they want. His ambition was like that and I'm so happy that Baba Mama has started a beautiful academy, very beautiful land he has got in Nagpur and from that academy this gentleman Mr. Nick has come and in such a short time, so remarkable, he's a genius, must be something special, that in such a short time to play a raag like Jog is very good. Only great musicians play that I've seen that I heard Vilayat Khansa and also I've heard our, his debut as you have known him very well. So all these difficult ragas, I thought he'll play yaman or something like that but he's here he plays Jog and so well like any other great musician. Actually my eyes were filled with tears. I don't know what to say that I never knew this academy can produce such good artists and such good talent will be utilized. Is more creditable because he's not an Indian and in such a short time he has picked up this difficult music, it's really absolutely impossible feat and I have no words actually to describe My joy that one of the desires My father had is fulfilled. Now once we establish this academy many people will go I'm sure to it and will learn this. In that of course Guruji has helped a lot, Sandesh has helped a lot, Jain has helped, everybody has helped but still I must say is creditable to the talent. I never knew Australians were that talented, they are, you will see their talent now, they are quite talented, I think it is still Ganesha's blessings on them that they are so talented. But this to play Indian music you see it's not a easy thing and it's remarkable. I don't know maybe My father's blessings are working or I don't know what's happening to this academy that's such a brilliant and such a beautiful, melodious rendering of this Jogaraga you have heard. I'm very grateful to him for really reproducing something that is an impossible feat. The second person for whom I have great love is as you know, is our little Dharanjaya. There is such a young boy and he is also I think he is a born genius, something like that. These days lots of prodigies are born, I think he is also a prodigy or something. He plays so well I mean to play this Raga in such a beautiful manner and this is a western instrument again to play on this western instrument. He really, if you know Vivaldi, if you have heard Vivaldi many a times it sounded like Vivaldi to Me. Do you think so? And this is something remarkable again at this young age. I don't know what to say but all My blessings and I take the bad eye from them. Nobody should do anything wrong to these boys. He couldn't come. It's a big story. He couldn't come. They said you pay no income tax. At this young age who can pay income tax in India and moreover he is the son of a farmer. In India farmers are not paying any income tax. So the Italians thought they are not paying income tax so how can they go? They might start working here or somewhere else. What was the idea? But thank God it came into My just into My own inspiration I felt I better tell Guido. And Guido knows somebody there luckily now. Anybody who doesn't get visas tell Guido for Italy because they are very troublesome. They have become very funny now all these Italians. I don't know but they have become quite funny and with they are coming only for two three days what is there to trouble them so much. So he went down and Guido had told somebody there whom he knows and they gave him the visa. So he came to the customs and the customs said why are you carrying this big instrument. They thought he is coming here to sell it to see. He said they see I am going for a program of Shri Mataji in India. He showed him the badge the customs know me there very well. They said all right go. But surprisingly here in Linatila, Alatmi, Linatila, Poonchai Airport, when he came here the airport authorities again objected to his carrying this instrument. Then he showed my badge and they said all right go. So I think now Sahaja Yoga is everywhere is acceptable at least in Italy it is now. That's a very great thing. There is something about Italians I felt always that they are very simple hearted people, good people and also something like Indians. You see their ways are different little bit but they can cheat as much as Indians can cheat. But Indian cheating is different and the Italian cheating is another style. But still I must say they are very sensitive to spirituality and they all have great love for Me. Madre all the time they say and they just I tell you I am surprised how they have accepted Me. This I can't expect from Germans. I can't expect this from English you see. I can't expect this from France of course no question. So the authorities also here are spiritual and surprisingly when I was coming from Russia in Moscow airport we met a very well known designer. They say he is the guru of designers and he just asked for his realization. Then another lady came she is very well known here she also asked for realization. Then another gentleman who was some sort of a minister or something he also asked for his realization. Can you imagine? In what country people can ask realization like this and now they are trying to contact us. So we are very well placed here in Italy I think and I feel quite safe with these people because they have respect for Mother. They have respect for children and that the Ganesha Puja should be here is a very very good thing because the respect for children is as much as in India maybe more. In this country you don't find funny things happening. So tomorrow again we'll have a nice session of Puja but Sandesh is the one I would say. Tomorrow I must thank him because I was thinking his hands would be bleeding now. We have known him very well and every time he plays something new he is working so hard and he has achieved such excellence. Now about Avi I don't know what to say because he is nothing but creativity personified. I don't know. Baba told me I don't know how he creates things, how it comes to him and such creation of this Raga is not so easy you know. It doesn't have so much expansion but the way he changed every time a new sort of a composition but they don't have anybody like Vivaldi or Valdi or anyone in front of them and the way he was really I tell you I don't know how to say but I'm so lucky that even in this country I can hear and enjoy such nice music and that you all are enjoying such nice music thanks to these four young people. Now because this was Ganesha's day we are celebrating here I thought we should get all young people who are not yet married but I'm told Avi is getting married so next day he will not come for Ganesha Puja but can come for another Puja and Sandesh I don't know why he doesn't want to get married. So it was not to be done by married people but Baba mama sent somebody from there to show what they have achieved and this Nick has married an Indian lady and that was really remarkable. So we all should give them a big, big, big hand. Now I'm sorry for this cold weather suddenly it has come I think with Russians I think. In Russia I was dressed up like an Eskimo all the time and this is very cold today but I think day time will be good tomorrow and also it might improve little bit. So one thing I have to explain because Michael Fogarty asked Me a question that what is the tradition is the classical music is first or the other thing is. We have changed it a little bit here. Why? Because they come out with very good films. Last time they showed us a very beautiful film and from America and all their programs were very good but they needed darkness. So we started their program after ten o'clock or ten thirty because then we said all right the classical music we can have even in the day time doesn't matter so we change. But today is the other way round. Somebody came to see Me and I was delayed also and it became dark very fast so I don't know what to do now. You change according to the need and here it is I hope you people do not mind the second shift. One thing about classical music is that it does settle you down and to Me it's nice to have something classical first. Not all but little bit at least it helps us to meditate and to come to the proper mood. Today it was in this way and I hope you all enjoyed it very much. So now the second shift is there. There's going to be an interval for about five ten minutes and after that we'll start the second one and hero is Alex who is going to do the job.

With all this jubilation, such joy, that atmosphere. From so many nations you see people dancing with joy in the name of God, shows the future all over in the whole world, Sahaja Yoga is going to spread. Because we are all together here in pure love and pure joy, is such a dream of Mine coming through. Don't know, I am so overjoyed to see all these nations who have joined together. They, I don't know how to say their efforts, have really created blossoms and blossoms of beauty and joy. I bless you all with My heart. Keep on, keep on moving, having faith in yourself, in your Self-realization. That's how we are going to progress. Tomorrow is a great day, we are going to celebrate Shri Ganesha's puja. And I was thinking, the better have it earlier because it's such, I don't know why the evening has become so cold, I think, must be Shri Ganesha's cold is blowing all over, can't explain. But we could have it earlier so that you don't suffer from this cold during puja time. It can be even worse, Me sitting there emitting all the vibrations, I don't know what would happen. So I would request all of you to tomorrow enjoy the morning nicely and about one o'clock we'll start the puja. It's not a very long puja because only Shri Ganesha's puja it is, so it's not going to be very long. I think, I don't know whom to thank because you people have done so well, all of you, all of you. I never expected all that. So beautifully everything arranged, organized. I never felt, at least I never felt it was night and I'm sure you all enjoyed it. May God bless you, may God bless you, thank you very much. All the best for Iran also I'm saying.

So, Sri Mataji, on behalf of all the Sahaja Yogis, I'd like to welcome you here amongst us. And on behalf of the English, I'd like to welcome all the Sahaja Yogis here. The first offering that we have for you, Sri Mataji, is a dance which illustrates the chakras and the kundalini rising through the chakras. The first if you have them for holy alms, the blessings of old band of gold. Fourth offers food to your devotees as they worship their innocent Lord. The second offering is a dance which illustrates the chakras and the kundalini rising through the chakras. This is our faith and with this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords and the mournful of the holy spirit.

I don't know what will happen now. We've got some difficult days ahead but it doesn't matter with me now because I've been to the mountain top and I don't mind. Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its place, but I'm not concerned about that just now. I just want to do God's will. And He's allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I've looked over and I've seen the promised land. I may not get there with you, but I want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the promised land. And I'm happy tonight. I'm not worried about anything. I'm not fearing any man. My eyes have seen the glory and the coming of the Lord.

Our Father, friendships full, bloods lost, who art in heaven, joy of tears, old fears, hallowed be thy name. Number day, summer hay, thy kingdom come. Misty morn, frosty dawn, thy will be done. Trains are laid, favorite happen, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, lost jobs, unloved boys. And forgive us our trespasses, angry mouths, and bitter thoughts, as we forgive those, bad TV and video, who trespass against us. Slot machines, dirty roads, lead us not into temptation, hot and tired, our makeup off, but deliver us from evil. Virgin sighs, the harlots curse, for thine is the kingdom, a sweet soul with a strong mind, the power and the glory, calling out to the night, forever and ever, searching for His mother's love. Amen. As William Blake said, I give you the end of a golden string. Only wind it into a ball. It will lead you in at heaven's gate, built in Jerusalem's wall. Amen.

The birth of Ganesha. No suspicion need be entertained. The timely arrival of Shiva in the midst of her bath stood up surprised, being bashful modesty itself. And because of this, the Goddess decided that her friend's suggestion we would be conducive to her good. She Parvati, the great Maya, thus thought, There must certainly be a servant of my own who will be expert in his duties. He must not stray from my orders even a speck. Thinking thus, the Goddess created a person with all the characteristics out of the dust from her body. He was totally spotless, handsome, huge in size, and had all brilliance, strength and valour. For he was Sri Ganesha. She gave him various clothes and ornaments, blessed him with benediction, and was pleased, saying to him, the one who is the soul of all. Ganesha, you are my son, my very own. There is none else to call my own.

Thus addressed, he bowed his head and said, What is your order, O great mother? I shall accomplish whatever you command. Oh handsome son, listen to my words. Work as my gatekeeper from today. You are my son, my own. There is none else who belongs to me. Good son, from today, without my permission, no one by any means shall intrude on my apartments. This is my desire. Saying this, she gave him a hard stick to defend himself with. She was delighted with his immaculate features, and out of love and joy she embraced and kissed him, placing him armed with his staff at the entrance to her door as her gatekeeper. Knowing thus that a son of great heroic power would not waver from his duty, he could relax and begin to take a bath unworried.

O excellent ones, at this very moment, Shiva, the great Lord himself, the soul of the universe, came near her door. Not knowing he was Lord Shiva and the consort of poverty, Ganesha said, Oh sir, without my mother's permission you cannot enter into her apartment. My mother is luminous like this moon and effulgent like the sun. She has entered her bath. You must therefore leave. Who is this boy lost in the goddess's darshan? Foolish fellow. Do you know whom you are forbidding? O wicked knave, do you know who I am? I am Shiva, the witness of the universe and the very heart of the mother. None else. Ganesha was unperturbed by these words, and by forming his duty he lifted his staff and beat Shiva for not moving. This, in turn, infuriated Shiva. You are a fool. Do you not realize who I am? I am Parvati's husband. Why do you dare forbid me go into my own home? O great Lord Shiva of matted hair and flowery eyes, do not try a second time to enter this house. This time I will get angry and I will strike you again with my staff. Shiva roared in disbelief at the situation. Strike me? Who is this fellow dares to strike me? Be warned, young man. I cannot believe his impudence. Ganas, find out who this lotus-eyed one is. I had better leave before my anger reduces him to ashes. We will deal with him soon.

Immediately the servants of Shiva followed his bidding and went up to question this powerful one guarding Shipava at his door. You there, boy. From whence do you come and what do you propose to do here? Guarding our mistress's door. What a liberty. If you have any sense left or any desire to remain alive, you'd better leave and quickly. O handsome fellows, the question is, who are you? And from whence did you come? Because wherever it was, you had better return, for no one will stand in opposition to me, Ganesha, guarding my mother's house. Listen, O fearless one, we are the ganas of Shiva. We are his doorkeepers. We've come to throw you out at the bidding of Lord Shiva, the supporter of all living things. But considering you are as one of the ganas, we're not going to kill you. Otherwise you'd already be dead. So better leave now while you still can and stop flirting with death. But the son of Parvati stood firm, not moving an inch, totally fearless. His form the manifestation of existence, knowledge and bliss.

The ganas of Shiva were helpless. They returned to Shiva, who grew angrier still. Who is this fellow? Why does he stand as doorkeeper to Parvati as if he were our enemy? Certainly this wicked knave wants to die. And you, ganas, why do you stand here helplessly, as if bereft of spirit, and complain to me about him? Go, throw him out! Thus commanded by Lord Shiva, the object of all meditation, the ganas returned to the place a second time and spoke to the doorkeeper. Why do you stay? Are you not but a jackal sitting on a lion's seat wishing for happiness? Oh fool, you will roar only as long as you do not feel the brunt of our attack. If you wish to stay alive, stand aside or fall forever now from grace. I am the son of the mother, so be warned, or I shall give you a foretaste of my valor, and it'll be you who will be the laughing stock, not me.

The ganas were amazed at Ganesh's powerful speech. They did not know what was to be done. They returned again to Shiva. What shall we do, O great Lord? This boy seems to be the personification of righteousness itself. Should we still act? Bounds of decency are observed by us. What should be done? So you return again, impudent wretches. You profess to be heroic, but you are not so. You are unfit to stand before me and speak. Go, and beat him. Go. Do not be scared of mere words. You must be driven away. I will speak no more.

When Shiva's ganas heard these words, they were filled with indignation. Listen there, boy. Arrogant knave, go from here immediately. If not, your death is certain. In the meantime, the goddess heard the noise of the wrangle outside between the ganas and her son, and instructed her maidservant and friend to find out what was happening. The friend went to the door, and in a moment she understood the whole matter. O greater goddess, the heroic ganas of Shiva are taunting and rebuking your very own son Ganesha, who is a god in your door. As it is, they can only enter by conquering your son, and not otherwise. And by them ataunting your very own gana, it amounts to you being taunted. Poverty, the mirror of divine contemplation, thus spoke. Alas, Shiva and his ganas cannot wait even a moment, and they try to force their way in. What should be done now? Shall I adopt a humble attitude, being subservient to Shiva's wish? What is to happen shall happen. What is done cannot be altered. Tell Ganesha, let your duty be done. Let them not enter forcefully. What are they? What are these ganas before you? Can they ever beat a person like you? Tell him.

On hearing these words from the friend of his mother, Ganesha became highly delighted, strengthened and lifted up. Girting up his loins, tying his turban firmly, and clapping his calves and thighs, he spoke fearlessly to all the ganas present. You say you are the gatekeepers? How is this so? You are standing there, and I am standing here. This is certain. Therefore, I am the only gatekeeper. When it is certain that you are standing here and I am standing there, then you may carry out the orders of Shiva. Until then, I must carry out the orders of Sri Parvati. Hence, O ganas of Shiva, you will not enter the apartment either forcefully or humbly. After all, I must do my duty, for I am the sun with the flower that never fades, the living light of the heavens, and the giver of life to the whole universe. You are the ganas of Shiva, the origin of self, the origin of the firmament and the great destroyer. Both of us are thus equal. Hence, we must both perform our own duties.

Once again, the ganas became ashamed. How could they battle with Parvati's immaculate son? They went to Shiva, and after bowing to him, stood in front of him and informed him of what had occurred. What can we do, O radiant one? O soul of your devotees of never-failing punishment! O ganas! Ganas! Enough of this! Battle may not be the proper course, but if we are going to be humbled, there will be rumors. If Shiva is subservient to his wife, this cannot be. You are my own. He is her own, but a mere boy, and he is standing against me. This cannot be! You, ganas, reputed experts in warfare the whole world over, must defend our honor. How can you thus demean yourselves in me by letting this boy conquer you with words alone? How can this woman be so obdurate, so stubborn, especially with her husband? Parvati will certainly derive the fruit of what she has done. Thus, what is in store shall happen. Therefore, this war must be fought.

After saying this, a primordial, immutable yogi, Lord Shiva, wearing his tiger hide and holding his mighty bow, became silent and dissolved into his own consciousness to witness his divine play. His ganas grinded their teeth in resolution and advanced towards this mere boy. Welcome, servants of Shiva. I, only one, and a mere boy, am ready. Let the goddess see the strength of her son. No one in the three worlds can ward it off, so let battle commence. We have been taunted and rebuked enough. Now, servants of Shiva, rush at Ganesha with all your weapons displayed for his destruction. Charge at him and remove this arrogant knave once and for all. Enough words. Destroy! Never! Let the power of the holy mother flow through my chakras, for only I am the eternal gatekeeper. I am like the light of the sun that can never be darkened by mere shadows. Your defeat is certain.

Nandin came first and caught hold of Ganesha's leg, pulling hard. Brigin then rushed at his other leg, but Ganesha was far too quick. Off, you foolish scanners. Ha ha! With one blow of my club. Ha! I crush your hands and break free. Ganesha wields his weapon like thunder, roaring in defiance, ploughing through my ganas like knife through butter. They fall to the ground in front of him in disarray. Our ganas are falling like flies being swatted. They fall on the ground. They run in all directions, with feet fractured and backs broken and heads shattered. He is like the annihilator of all in the form of death at the end of a kalpa. The three worlds trembled at this battle as the weapons were fired at Ganesha who either pulverized them into dust by the flaying of his club or returned them with double strength.

Some of the gods began to worry. Brahma's lifespan is not yet complete, but the whole universe is undergoing untimely destruction. Can this really be Shiva's wish? The noise of the battle pervades the three worlds. I am the goddess, the power of all. I cannot believe Shiva is trying to destroy my son. Now, two great Shaktis awaken. One assume a terrifying form. Open your mouth as wide as the caverns of a black mountain. The other assume the form of lightning, wearing many arms, huge and terrible, ready to punish you all. In your mouths, you will catch the weapons hurled at Ganesha and spit them out to the terrified ganas. And so it happened. With these Shaktis protecting Ganesha, not one weapon came anywhere near him, the hero of the hour, as he seemed to stir and churn the vast army of Shiva in the same manner as a great mountain churning the ocean of milk.

The great army became agitated and distressed, gasping for breath and shaken by the boys' blows. They gathered together and spoke to one another. What shall be done? The ten directions have become invisible for the whirling of his iron club. Never has such a battle been witnessed. The earth with all its oceans quake, mountains fall down with fury, the sky whirls with planets and stars, everything is shaken. Some of the gods fly from this boy incarnation. Lord Shiva, saviour of all the world, only you can restore our dignity from this disgrace. Lord of gods, Lord of the dance, Lord of the mountains, Lord of all, the arrogance of the ganas has been removed by you. The impudence of the gods thus also has been removed by your giving this great strength to Ganesha. O Lord Shiva, full of nectar, occupying the lotus of the heart, honour your own gods and ganas suitably, make them flourish, to not indulge in your own sport of play, but destroy Ganesha in this drama of yours. Again, the army moved on Ganesha, as if in reverent worship by the multitude, but battle again was to commence. And like the very heart of the earth exploding in terror at this Holocaust, the battle that ensued was terrible.

Shiva became worried. Ganesha explodes in wrath, like lightning striking all who come near. He has been conferred with even greater strength by these two shaktis. All the gods, including Vishnu, are hit by him. The strength of my army pours down on him like a mighty waterfall crashing to the ground below it. But all in vain. The army is being sapped of its strength. He is of Tamasika nature and inaccessible. Without deception he cannot be killed. Vishnu, cause him delusion, then I will kill him! The infuriated Shiva takes up his trident and advances toward Ganesha, but the son of Parvati, remembering the lotus-like feet of his mother, strikes the Lord with his hands. Shiva's trident falls to the ground. The Supreme Lord takes up his bow. Pinaka, Ganesha, like fury, fells that to the ground also with his great iron club. Shiva, who has manifested in his ten-armed form, seems to reel as five of his hands are struck. But now he takes up his trident with the other five, his pure attention ready and waiting for the right moment to kill Ganesha. He is blessed. He is the greatest of heroes, of great strength, of great valor. Many gods and great warriors I have seen in the extent of the entire three worlds. None of them are equal to him in brilliance.

Now, Ganesha, son of the great Shakti, whirls the iron club at Vishnu and he splits it in twain. Ganesha, picking up a piece of the club, throws this at also at Vishnu. But Garuda, the mighty eagle and vehicle of Vishnu, catches this in his mouth and renders it useless. Thus, for a long time the two heroes, Vishnu and Ganesha, fought with each other and many with the tales told and songs sung hereafter of these two heroes of great valor. But finally, after terrible fighting that seemed to last an eternity, Vishnu was struck and fell to the ground stunned. And so it happened. While Ganesha was occupied with the great Lord Vishnu, Sri Shiva, the three-eyed one who pervades the entire universe, took this opportunity. And with his trident that seemed to explode like thunder from the heavens, he severed off Ganesha's head. A great stillness enveloped the assembly. The great army stood still. Slowly, cheers were heard. Then jupilation took hold like a fever, even as the great Shiva became sorry for what he had done.

But the news of the defeated Ganesha and the manner in which it was achieved was sent to Parvati, the great goddess, the bride of Shiva. And on hearing the news, she grew pale with anger. How can this be? What should I do? Where shall I go? What great misery has befallen me? My son has been killed by the gods and ganas. The end is near for them. I will destroy them all. I will create the great deluge before the end of time. Lamenting thus, the great goddess of all the worlds created in a moment hundreds and thousands of shaktas of all shapes and sizes. Beautiful, terrible, handsome, frightful. They bowed into devotion to their great mother, the mother of the universe, as she blazed like the shining of a thousand suns. O shaktas, O goddesses, now a great deluge shall be created by you at my bidding. You must not hesitate in this regard. Friends, devour forcefully all you see. Sages, gods, yaksas, raksas, all you see.

On being commanded by her, these furious shaktas erupted into the sky like sparks from a furnace. But these sparks glowed ever brighter with anger and grew in strength as they enveloped the skies, hungry for revenge. And on seeing the gods and ganas congregated in celebration, they tore into them. And just as fire consumes dry grass, the wrath of the shaktas began destroying all that they could. Within moments, a sea of blood swamped the land as arms and legs were hacked off by these many-henned and limbed creatures. Wherever the gods looked, these shaktas were present in hellish form, humpbacked, tall-headed, lame, terrifying. These shaktas took out the gods in their hands and threw them into their open mouths. It seemed to Shiva, Vishnu, and Brahma that the dissolution of the universe had already begun and the world would soon be destroyed. When Sri Parvati is in a fiery rage, none dare to stand up to her power for unseeing the great mother's dazzling brilliance, burning all around, all her frightened. Even our great lord, whose delusion itself seems distressed like an ordinary man. What is to be done? As long as the goddess Parvati does not favor us, there will be no happiness. No suspicion may be entertained in this matter. We must go therefore and try to appease her anger. Each of us must worship the goddess in our hearts. We must approach her and bow to her lotus feet. For she is pure forgiveness.

O mother of the universe, obeisance to you. Obeisance to you again and again. To you, O Chandika, obeisance to you, O Kalyani. Mother, you alone are the primordial Shakti, the eternal cause of creation, the sustaining power, and the eternal cause of the solution. Queen of the universe, you are its guardian. In the form of the universe, you are its receptacle. You are worshipped by all the gods, and those who are devoted to you themselves become supporters of the universe. We prostrate at your feet. You are our mother. You are our father. You are mercy. You are everything. Restore of eternal bliss. Giver of boons on the one hand and fearlessness on the other. Ocean of beauty and destroyer of all sins. Mother, please forgive us. Be pleased with our worship. Spread peace in the world and peace within us, for you are the peace within us. You are the life within us. You are our consciousness and our pure desire. You are the silence within. And mother, you are forgiveness. Sri Mahalakshmi, Maha Saraswati, Mahakali. Manifesting for your children as the past, the present, and the future, so that creation may exist and evolve within. Forgive us for our delusion, for verily you are the great illusion. And at the end of time, you will come with all your powers in the pure form, your nirmala form, and give emancipation to the whole world, and therefore meaning to itself. Can this still be if the end is so near? Oh mother, beginning, middle, and end of all, the question and the answer. Mother, you who are everything, forgive us. The three worlds are agitated by your fury. And it seems as if the emancipation of the world at the end of the Kali Yuga is not going to happen. The Lord is standing here, witness of his creation. But you are his power and we are the manifestation of his desire to bow to your lotus feet. What are the gods? Vishnu, Brahma, and the others, but your subjects? We stand here with palms joined together in reverence. Salutations to you.

On hearing these words, she Parvati was pleased and replied to her children with her mind full of compassion. If my son regains life, there will not be any further annihilation. If you can arrange for him an honorable status and position amongst you as the chief of the Ganas, there may be peace in the world. When the gods and Ganas heard these words spoken by their mother, tears filled their eyes. Chaitanya poured out of their hearts with love for their mother. Shiva smiled. His body glowed with pride. Surely she is my heart. For she is the manifestation of compassion, love, and forgiveness. And by her maya, she is the supreme creator of illusion and confusion, even to the greatest of gods. We must give life back to Sri Ganesha. It must be done accordingly to bring peace over all the worlds. Bring the headless body of Ganesha and wash it well. Then go north and whatever person or animal you meet, cut off its head and fit it to the body. They carried out Shiva's behest and acted accordingly, bowing graciously to the body of Sri Ganesha. They traveled north and the first animal they met was a single-toothed elephant. Cutting off its head, they returned to Sadashiva and fixed the elephant head onto Sri Ganesha's body. What has been ordered by you has been carried out. Let the task left incomplete be done by you. We bow in devotion to you, Lord Shiva, the heart of our mother and the witness of her play. For since we are all born out of your brilliant energy, let that energy awaken, Sri Ganesha.

Saying so, they jointly sprinkled the holy water and evoked by the recitation of the Vedic mantra. The boy was immediately resuscitated back to life. O holy ones, on seeing this, all rejoiced and the misery ended. She, Parvati, on seeing her son burst with joy and love, filling the quarters of the universe, the three worlds and all her creation with pride and happiness. The reborn child hugged his mother, tears of love filling his eyes, his heart dancing with the miracle of life and total worship for his mother. She, Parvati, turned to him and said, O my dear son, you have had great traumas since your very birth. You are blessed and contented now, for you will receive worship before all the gods. You will be free from distress. Vermilion is visible on your face now. Hence you will be worshipped with vermilion by all men always. All achievements will certainly accrue to him who performs your worship and all obstacles will certainly perish.

Ganesha glowed with satisfaction, stretched his elephant ears and swung his trunk with joy. She, Parvati, worshipped her son once more and by her blessings instantly peace reigned. Sadashiva devoutly came near his wife and placed the boy, Sri Ganesha, in her lap for the happiness of all three worlds. This truly is my son. Ganesha reverently bowed his head to his father, then to his mother, his eyes as the sun and the moon were pools of bliss and happiness. The three wise kings, Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma, then granted Ganesha various boons and said to all assembled, O great gods, ganas and all who hear these words, just as we three are worshipped in all the myriads of all the universes, so will Ganesha be worshipped by all of you. We are the offspring of primordial nature. He is the same and hence shall be worshipped by all the gods. May we worship and love our mother, the heart and purity of all. You are the force that creates, the energy that pervades and the spirit that protects. And those who seek union with God pray through you, for you are our eternal self. Cause of the world, greatest of all yogis, eternally worshipped by the yogis, obeisance to you the primordial being, obeisance to you Omkara. My son, born in the primordial cosmic egg, you are the alpha and the omega. You will be foretold by prophets and herald the golden age of the comforter of the mother. For you are Shri Kalki and at the end of time you will ride the white horse, obeisance to you. I am pleased, there is no doubt. And when I am pleased, the whole universe is pleased. Since you showed great valour as Parvati's gatekeeper, you will always remain brilliant and happy. He who performs worship unto his ability with faith shall derive the fruit of all his pure desires. Thus I have spoken. Thus it will be.

All bowed down to Ganesha, who smiled, radiating love. His big belly swirled with pride and it seemed as though the whole creation worshipped his feet. Those lotus feet, that just the dust from them could create universes. O holy ones listening to this story, how can it be described in words the sheer delight of Shri Parvati? For what greater joy can there be for a mother than to see her children happy and contented? The divine drums were sounded, celestial damsels danced, flowers were shouted down upon them. The whole universe was at peace. Having thus narrated the story of Shiva and Parvati, along with that of Shri Ganesh with reverence, whosoever hears this narrative auspiciously and with a pure heart shall have everything. All will become free of sin and all negativity will be washed away. It is the enhancer of happiness and conducive to the attainment of heaven on earth. It confers salvation and reveals Shiva's principles. It is pleasing to both Shiva and Parvati and increases devotion and identity with Shiva. This beautiful story will always be heard by devotees who seek liberation and freedom from worldly desires. Om Shri Ganesh Nama, we bow to the lotus feet of the manifestation of innocence and purity. Om Shri Shiva Nama, we bow to the lotus feet of Lord God Almighty, the eternal witness of all. Om Shri Parvati Nama, we bow to the lotus feet of our mother, Shri Adi Shakti, the immaculate desire of God Almighty, the holy mother, the comforter, the all powerful, the pure goddess Shri Nirmala Devi, from which all things emanate. And by Shri Ganesh's grace we ask that He remove all obstacles so that we may dwell forever at her lotus feet in the heart of the universe, in the heart of Sadashiva, Lord God Almighty.

My flower children, you are angry with life. Like small children whose mother is lost in darkness, you sulk, expressing despair at the fruitless end of your journey. You wear ugliness to discover beauty. You name everything false in the name of truth. You drain out emotions to fill the cup of love. My sweet children, my darling, how can you get peace by waging war with yourself, with your being, with joy itself? Enough for your efforts of renunciation, the artificial mask of consolation. Now rest in the petals of the lotus flower, in the lap of your gracious mother. I will adorn your life with beautiful blossoms and fill your moments with joyful fragrance. I will anoint your head with divine love, for I cannot bear your torture anymore. Let me engulf you in the ocean of joy, so you lose your being in the greater one who is smiling in your calyx of self, secretly hidden to tease you all the while. Be aware and you will find Him vibrating your every fiber with blissful joy, covering the whole universe with light.

Shri Parvati, Shri Mataji, Shri Adi Shakti, you who are our very soul, please let us, your children, be your ganas so that we may serve you, so that the whole of creation may fulfill its destiny and see and become the vision of heaven on earth that you have given us. Shri Adi Shakti Mataji, Shri Nirmala Devi Namo Mataji.

The people who are standing on this side, there should be room over here, so if you can come around, there should be space for you to sit. Don't go outside, come around the back of the tent, inside the tent, or possibly behind the stage. Also if Paul Francis is here, could he come and speak to me please? Shri Mataji is suggesting that the children who are crying or small children could be taken to sleep now because the music program is going to start and it will perhaps gone for some hours.

This beautiful, supreme performance, it will be hard for any artist to perform before you. Anyway, we have tonight an artist from Napoli. And she was performing in contemporary dance and recently she was in Benares, in Benares University, for about four years, sponsored by the Indian government. And she has been learning Bharatanatyam. Her guru is Shri Premananda Ombal, who was the disciple of Rumi Nidevi Arundale. And she is here tonight just to seek your blessing, the blessing of Shri Saraswati herself. We have now Swabina Rapana. Thank you.

At the basis of Indian dance is the manifestation of Lord Shiva in the form of Nataraja, the Lord of the dance. His dance symbolizes the creation and destruction of the universe. The little drum called Damaru, which Lord Shiva holds in his right hand, gave the first rhythm to the universe when it was still immersed in chaos. And when his body started to move, the earth took form, the oceans parted, the forests grew, and from the center of his left hand a flame burned, symbolizing that always present in the flow of the life is the power of destruction. The other two hands are extended towards man, saying through the symbolic language of movement, the first words to humanity, do not fear, for I am with you. In the Natya Shastra, it tells how Lord Brahma, the creator, gave the gift of dance to humanity, and that the creation of the dance was the result of the prayers of the guardians of the world, asking for liberation of humanity, liberation from vulgarity, from the ego, and from the lower passions. For the Indian culture, the dance, like every form of art, is a divine expression whose medium is the physical body. When the theme, the music, the costumes, and the presentation are pure and elevated, the dance will sublimate the emotions, lifting the artist and the audience to a higher level.

The program will start with a traditional invocation to Lord Ganesha. Then is the dance, Alaripu, in which the dancer surrenders herself to the supreme God. In the Alaripu, which means blossoming, the dancer slowly opens herself like the bud of a flower. Starting from the sama, the position of the bronze statues in the temples, she slowly wakes up and starts moving eyes, neck, arms, feet, and hands. The Anjali Hastas, when their hands are joined as for prayer, are full of significance. When they are above the head, it is a supplication to God. On the forehead or on the chest, it means salutations to the guru and to the audience.

The next item is called the Asta Padi, a poem taken from the Gita Govinda, which tells of the divine love between Krishna and Radha. In Indian culture, the dance of Krishna with Radha and the gopis represents the eternal desire of the soul to be united with God. Krishna, in this moment, he is so beautiful. With the gopis, he holds in dance. And many, many gopis are all around him. Come and see, O Gopi, how radiant he is while dancing. Come and see, O bashful lady, he has a luminous aura around his head while he plays the flute and dances. Come quickly, there are the gopis, all with garlands, and he plays and the gopis dance. Sandal paste is on his body. When there is lightning and the sky is full of dark clouds, like this is his body. Of a wonderful fabric is his yellow dress, and a garland of flowers hangs on his neck. While he dances, the pearls of his earrings swing. Between his cheeks, there opens a beautiful smile, very captivating. One gopi, with beautiful eyebrows and moving eyes, while she dances, she pauses, immobilized at the vision of him. And something very deep in her heart takes her to ecstasy. And like this, she enters meditation. The beautiful, the bashful lady, so much. Krishna, the demon maddow has destroyed. Krishna with beautiful countenance, like a lotus flower, come and see.

Now we present Kalyani Jathisvaram. It is a pure dance where the dancer describes intricate permutations and combinations of steps and movements on the rhythm of the Mrindangam. Niropa Dhamma Gedini Jathisvaram.

Now we present the Todaya Mangalam in which I describe the different avatars of Lord Vishnu, praising Him as Sri Rama, as Lord Krishna, as Narasimha and Venkateshwara. Victory to you, of Sita, you are the husband. Victory to you, also the demon Vibhishana, he bowed in prayer to you. Victory to you, like a lotus flower are your feet that I adore. I pray to you, the one who has immense compassion. Praising you is even the God Indra, please protect me. Oh you who of Sita are the husband, protect me. The evil aspects of ego you have destroyed. Oh hero of the mountain Viyankata. Oh Lord Rama with your bow. Oh God with the third eye of emerald, in humility I bow to you. The demons you have destroyed and Mount Makunda you have lifted up. Oh Hari who flies on the bird Garuda, from your navel grows the lotus flower. From here the God Brahma is born. Oh perfect soul, who destroyed the pains of the world, Krishna, Narasimha, the lion headed. Oh Narayana who sleeps on the ocean of milk, glory to you. Also the wise of the gods Narada have sounded your glory. Also I play and sing for you. They pray all together, the gods at your lotus feet. Oh you of the Viyankata mountain, you are the hero. Oh Narayana, I offer to you my devotion. Oh Vishnu, glory to you. Many demons you destroyed. Oh Krishna who drives the cows, I bow to you.

The final number is a dance of pure joy called Tilana, with a very intricate rhythm and beautiful sculptural poses. This particular dance was composed and choreographed by Rukmini Devi Arandale, a very famous dancer, and it is dedicated to Kamakshi, an aspect of the Devi that is particularly worshipped in Kanchipuram in South India. And the song is called Tum Tum.

Shri Mataji: I must say it was a real treat and what a joyful event to see a girl from Napoli going down to Benaras and to learn this is the very difficult dance. My daughters used to do this dancing so I know a lot about it and one has to practice so much before coming to the stage every action she did very meticulously, perfectly, absolutely as it should be. As if she had all the background of Indian culture and Indian mythology. It's very difficult because see to put up all these expressions, extremely difficult for a girl who is from Italy I can't understand. I must say I must at least learn Italian language minimum of minimum. In Kanchipuram is actually on the style of Tylana they call it and the Tylana is a style which went from the north to the south on basis of Tarana as we must have heard of Tarana played by, sung by many people. And it was surprising Shivaji's younger brother Sajidaw was given a part of Naga Patnam and areas around it where he developed this dancing style of Bharatanatyam quite a lot. And there he introduced this style of Tarana which is more on Kathak we can say also on the Tarana style of music with the dancing which was very much Bharatanatyam.

Now you must have seen in Bharatanatyam the difficulty is that they dance with both the knees bent. So it's quite a difficult dance but the most surprising thing for Me was a girl from Italy could pick up all these little, little expressions. I mean these are very Indian expressions of Indian women and the culture is all right because we know all this but for her here I mean what I see is so, so horrible absolutely certain things that I am shocked the way women are developing here into funny type of exposures and all that and from this culture to that culture to go and learn all these things is really very, very remarkable and I don't know. One day may come when your children here may learn this dancing from her and maybe from through that they will understand the beauty is not in showing off the body but in showing the art through your body and dedication to God. This is very strenuous dance and the way she has done it is really I don't know how to say it was too much to believe that she is from Italy, from Napoli. Even her smile was absolutely Indian smile I tell you. May God bless her.

Also I must say the English showed such nice talent of their dancing and we all enjoyed it thoroughly. It was very well composed, beautifully done and also bringing the western music combined with eastern rhythm was something great. Of course William Blake is the real hero of England. I think his wishes are going to be fulfilled very soon now and we can see that happening in England. Moreover the drama was also another very remarkable thing and the acting was very good. I must say I was really surprised how many talented people we have and how much they know about drama. Maybe next time they may not need any papers to read. They can just act without any papers. I'm sure they are so capable, so talented but such long, long sentences naturally you see they have to have something to prompt them. I really enjoyed it the way it was said and done and with all the different moods they created. We have such a lot of talent in our yogi family and one must encourage them and develop them and give full expression. It's very beautiful to see all these beautiful entertainments which gives you nothing but nirananda. May God bless you all. Thank you.

So, Shri Mataji, fellow Sahaja Yogis. Before this evening's concert I'd just like to say a few words about the artists. Nishat Khan is someone who needs no introduction. He's played before you, Shri Mataji, on several occasions and many Sahaja Yogis have heard his music always with great appreciation. As you know, he comes from one of India's foremost families of musicians, a family which has, I would say, adorned not only Indian culture but world culture for generations. And he himself is now being recognized as one of the young masters of Indian classical music. I must say about Nishat that he's always so anxious to play for Shri Mataji. So much so that this time he's flown from Japan to be here with us and then next week he's flying back. Accompanying him on the tabla, we're very happy to welcome Sandeep Papadkar, who is from another very distinguished family of musicians of India. And of course we've heard his cousin Sandesh so many times. So, Shri Mataji, thank you. Please take your seats.

Jai Shri Mataji and good evening to all of you. Obviously it's a very great honour for me to come back here on such a special day because three years ago I played for the same puja in Fuji and I'm very happy to be back here. Thank you very much for having me on such a special day. I appreciate it very, very much. I will play Ragh Darbari Kannala as Shri Mataji has asked me to.

It seems so possible to have absolute knowledge, freedom and observation. Sahaja Yoga's aim is to free people from the bondage of their conditioning and their trouble and make them complete and connect them, connect them to the All-pervading power of love which is the power which does all the living work and that is the power which starts with you, you become very dynamic, very compassionate and very smooth and has extreme gain. There is no need to create. There are some of us with Mahatma Gandhi, I don't know him, he taught only many things about it. If he was living, he would have impressed him, come out and say, come out. Because that time we were not free-conceited, so we couldn't think out of it. Many scriptures said, now we are free-concentrated, we have so many people who are following Sahaja Yoga that there is no love. Love, which we have never used before and once you feel that power, you become extremely powerful ourselves and that is the pure love without fear then lust and it completely changes personality and the priorities. It is for the benefits of your being and for the emancipation of the human being. I did not choose Sahaja Yoga but I was born as a realized servant. I tried to find out later, I reached, I could give you a nice center. I mean, what was My question, I was told you come to the center of Sahaja Yoga. I was born, I was born with all these possibilities. It depends on the people's attitude towards Sahaja Yoga is different. But I think people of the Eastern Bloc and Russia are very nice people, whatever may have been the governments. But people are very nice, they are very deep people and their attention is not very good at all. So they are very simple people and they take this brutality very fast, much faster than the Western countries which are lost and their ego and their connection is very good. They are very superficial people, they are so good. I would always think that all the people, they can purchase with money and because they cannot purchase means they are not very happy. What they cannot sell now, which they cannot sell now, is they don't understand. Still we have thousands and thousands of Sahaja Yogis now. There are many countries which are coming to Sahaja Yoga and now we can add a poor all these people in the world and also Russia and India, India, how it is, which country, what? This day, first I went to Poland and then to Austria-Bosnia, East Germany, Austria-Bosnia, and there was a flower and I was referenced very and from there I think it is the most. What is your first impression of Sahaja Yogis? They will be such love. This is a round subject but it's like a position. What I want to do is to know what you are. You are one of the sun, light or there is a light on the center of the Spirit. You start seeing the centers, what is the topic of the center? You see the others and know them from your center of the Spirit, it's a living, training process by which comes the last trick and you jump into the realm, you can see from the top. All the questions, joy, happiness, there is very little. Every way, in the center of the Spirit. What are the topics? If they ask. Everyone does not ask. I cannot force you to ask. If they ask, I can get you to ask. Because I'll do it with them, I'll get you to ask because they have to make the yours for this. If they ask, I can get you to ask. I can see that. I promise you. I'm very precious. I see all of them but little bit I don't. You know, it's a mother's heart. Mother's heart. There are more. Many people have come from Myself and I do not go to the money. Why do you go? You see because they said it's a I think they said that I can't do it. No, no, they said that. No one will come. Yes, get to Me. I'm going to Stoboe and then to New York. New York is amazing. Yes, yes. And similar place also Russia, Austria, France, Germany. America is the least. And why? They are very superficial. They have no traditions and also traditional, mystical, and now there are so many problems that are created by them, so to have everything, which is just abandonment. There's no wisdom. There's no wisdom. One can be intelligent but one has to be wise. That wisdom is life. Gradually they'll come round I'm sure. This time is to know what is the truth. Where are you staying? I don't know where they are at. Where are you staying? I'm staying. How many of you take the house when I take the house? I don't know. I'm staying. Thank you.

Can you hear me? No, I can't hear you. It was a gun party which I had to be in. Somebody has to become the brother of Christ Mother. Mama. Hello. Gavin has been appointed as the mama of the girl. Mama means mother's brother. Because all Bombay people are actually her uncle on the father's side, so we had to find a mother's side brother. So Gavin is the best because she'll be there so Gavin can look after her. Good idea. Gavin and his wife are mama and mommy. I'm sorry this was not all right. So mama couldn't have left. Just wait.

Ian and his wife they are here. Where is Ian and his wife? Anna. And Kamala. You become mama and mommy. She is here. Gavin is coming. Let Gavin come back. Ian you have to go in. You see, Malcolm must have a parents to give him to work out so we'll use Gavin and his wife, while we'll use Ian and Anne as the mama and mommy. That's a better idea. What's your name? Sister Anna. She's my sister. Prachi sister. Nudichi. Garboli. But at least she has a little English girl. Margaret. How good. She's my mama's sister. There are two brothers and this is one sister. All right. And this one is the sister of the bride. Because she has no sister, we have to have a sister from here. So she'll have to go up to the bride. You have to come with her. Come forward please.

Jane and Gavin, just a minute, should be the parents of Mr. Malcolm. So you go and sit with him. All right. Wow. Sundar. Atat thu hai. Come along, you have to come here. Daniel, you come and we'll be there. Ite masa hai. Now you have to look after her sari. You have to look after her things, whatever she needs. You are the bridesmaid. Tung ji bao bahi takha tumi. You are her brother and you are the aunt. She means her brother's wife. Haata hai baka hai bao tumala dilay. Ani hi tumala bahi ni. Kala ka? Tua mama mami. Sagar hain chahi nati go thi samad li kine tumala. Mal ka hai, kal sa rahi hai kala maha hai. Maan, ghotin na madhi kiran kamche haath hai. Gura che. Mal kum che. Ne, mal kum che hana ke lem. Karan hei lo kthi che rahaat na, kyan chakad hai nahin la maha. Maan, you are shaking, ma'am. Maar, aapun basa, maar pun aara maar kum. Naar. Changa se na laa. Ka, chala. Aata, chukka no gauri pujaan kum dasa. Tu samad post maar hai.

Now the first ceremony is, she is the Gauri and she is the Kanya, she is the virgin, you see. And so she worships Me as a virgin, which is called as Gauri Pujaan, is done in every Vedic parish that Gauri is first worshipped as a virgin because she should give her blessings to the bride of her chastity and also the blessings that she will remain always loyal to her husband. And she prays at the feet of the Gauri that make all the marriage ceremony nicely and everything should be done very well. This is the essence of it, that let it pass, my married life be all right because Gauri herself worshipped Shiva like this.

Nirmala Mataji, Sri Kalki Saksha, Sri Sastra Swami, Moshaprajni Mataji, Sri Nirmala Devi, Guru Paramparajni, answer part only. Make her get up. You have to look after her. Lift her up. How is Mangal? Now you go and stand at her back. If she needs anything, your saree or anything, you have to sit down. Ata, you see, you should go and stand on the other side now.

Now you all have to bring him along. This side is all girls' side. And the girl is not supposed to see the boy before wedding, though he is so tall, I don't know how he can do it. May God bless you. Now stand here. Now whatever you have in your hand, you see, these are to be thrown seven times. So don't throw them at the same time. And when they say, saava dhan, then you have to put it. All right? This is called as Mangalashtakas. So seven times they will be saying, and seven times you have to put little bit of this on them. You see, and then the girl will garland the boy so that she accepts him, then he can marry her. Not without her acceptance.

You sit down here. Come along. Now what about you having something in your hand? Now sit down. Be careful. Now see the bride. Did you see the bride? Ah, see, that's the bride now. Madam. This is the most solemn thing. You see, this is Swayamvara actually, where the girl chooses the boy and accepts him as the husband. This is being translated in English. So, Rustam can read it beforehand and then will start singing it. Rustam, where are you? Hey, Dusre bhajye, you are another bud boy. Where are you missing? Bhajji means the priest, you see, and we make a fun of that. So these two budgies are there, your third one. First let me say in English. This is the first one. This is a very special solemn thing to be written from Sahaja Yoga. All is Mangalashtaka. Shri Gyan Raja Samagari Mata has come to you in formal disown as Shri Nirmala Devi. No, they both the hands like this, sir. Ohejaz de Kundalini, Vaheen Sangha Chaitanya. The Kundalini is anxious to meet Shri Sadashiva and now the time has come to establish the Mahayoga. To Shri Sahukamakshi, your parents have consented to this marriage and your brother out who is present to spread your faith amongst the Sahaja Yogis. Shri Mataji is also there to settle your marriage and to bring it to a great success. Our holy Shri Mataji also desires to convert this into a great family of Sahaja Yogis. To who? To Malcolm. Due to your great good fortune, you have succeeded in getting such a gracious and lovely lady in Kamanchi as your wife, who will support your fame and spread it. We all Sahaja Yogis expect you both to spread Sahaja Yoga through your efforts, wherever you may reside. All the Sahaja Yogis from the world have guaranteed to witness your marriage. Such a marriage you need to be observed in this age. I wonder whether all the deities will come down from heaven to witness this wonderful marriage and to receive the blessings in this age of the great yoga. Yes, Shri Mataji.

God bless you. So, may God bless you both for a very happy and prosperous life. Just look after Me. You can put one foot down on the ground. Stay. Now, this part is there. And now, this part. See the bride? Now, we'll see what are they doing. We'll see them. Just go and see. Be careful. Slow down. Get down. Now, come and sit down here. All of you are from the boys' side, so you have to sit that side. Yes, girls' side, sit this side. Now, let's have a real music down this side. If you need something, you have to give me water or anything, all right? We'll just sit next there. Come here. You shall be upon this side. You have to learn. You are going to be our official bhajji now. Come here. She is on this side. She can help her. Hold her hand. Support her. Now check. Now check. Smell it. What is this? A hole. Smell it. All right. Now! Just give them.

So to tie the knot you have to take the name of your wife and the wife has to take the name of the husband. So I have called her husband and wife. Now, and then, He is born in a Brahmin family. Wherever Mr. Damle is from the Brahmin family and his uncle is also from a Brahmin family and we call them priests, you see. So I said the third priest has appeared now, which is why they are laughing. It's a nice flower frog. This is not ours. We have to go to the bride. Now see what they do. Now what they do? Do you see? Now, they will teach you what is to be said, to take each other's name. We don't take directly but in a couplet. She will teach you out. She will have to ask for help. What is the name of the husband?

She has taken the name of her husband with a couplet. That's called as ukhana. And she says that on the day of Kamakshi's marriage, I take the name of my husband, that is Vishnupan, in the very fond company of Sahaja Yogis. That you have to say. You can't help it. Yes, now come along. You have become mama mamis. Come along now, let me, this ladra. What did he say? Just a minute. Yeah, it's a quick poetry you have to compose and put the name of the wife. I'm coming, let's see you on a car. Where is he? Oh, I know, poor thing, all right, come here. I never heard. My life is lost. Again loudly. Did you hear? No. My Mother's Grace, I wasn't lying. In Adam's company, my life is lost. Did you say anything now? Now just a minute. Now they will teach you also. I mean you must compose your own poetry, you are all poets. What do you think? Can you suggest? It's called Olympian. I'll tell you. We never heard anything. Please again we can't. Don't be nervous. Just laugh out. It's just a joke. Loudly. It's beautiful to be a pleasant teacher and mother. And with my husband Ian, my life is one of the most beautiful. All right. Thank you. Now we'll get three. You can take one. Thank you very much. Sit down. We'll have to sit because people can't see.

Now they have come to garland, the gardens of their family whom they worship. The goddess of their family is Kamakshi Devi of Goa. So now because I am Kamakshi, they have come to garland Me. Both of them. Namo Namaha. Nithyananda. Anantaso Bhaktivedi. Bless you. You have to give the blessing to the bride that she will always remain a married woman because it's regarded as the biggest blessing to a woman to be married to one man all her life, till she lives. Now you have to do the last part, all right? Called as laja ho. You are not to leave her hand. You can't walk off leaving her hand. They are actually tied together with a knot. And every time they move out they have to be careful about each other. You sit next to her. Take all the things out of here. One more square and come, Betty. Put it here. All gone to the back.

Now see what you did. I would find everyone out first. They are going to come to their place. You are Malcolm's sister, all right? So you sit down with him. At his back. You must look after him, all the brothers also. If he needs a handkerchief or anything. They have put all the fire. Don't touch me. They are putting the fire. Thank you. You want to give one for me to the bride? Oh, the bride is here. You can see what she's done in her life. Just go and see some children. Go to your dad. She wants to see the bride. So let her sit in your lap. You are not wearing nothing. She's my person.

To suggest, you see, the brother of the bride has to pull the ears of the husband to say that, please take care of my sister. So he has to just screw the ear a little. He's done it. Thank you very much. Is it mine? I didn't know. Thank you. Now they have to walk together seven steps called as saptapadi. Seven steps as the promises are. Warren, have you got those seven conditions of marriage in English? Can you bring them? It is better to say them in English. Malcom has to be picked, so you be near Malcom. You have to say them in English. First, how many are for the girls who have put in? Three. First three, she leads. In Sahaja Yoga, we have given equal importance to husband and wife. So first the wife leads the husband and then the husband has to lead the wife, all her life. These are the seven powers that we present to all Sahaja Yoga managers. The first three are set by the bride, the second three are set by the bride and the final one is set by both of them. So for the first step the bride should repeat after Me. I will help you keep your Mooladhara chakra in order. You hand over all milk which is in your possession. I will take care of those things. You should only eat the food that is cooked by me or your brothers and sisters. And if taken outside the room, you will vibrate. I will be loyal to you and you will be loyal to Me. Now ways are in motion.

I believe in your happiness and peace. Now give me happiness and peace. And love and attention. And you will know that I have to think about my happiness and peace. But you will not go outside without my attention. You will never understand that. I will tell you my question and I will tell you my answer. I have discussed something about the past, so that is the special thing about the past. And you will not discuss something about the past. Put your foot on the last one. Yes, stand there. Honey, you also go ahead. They are Mother Father. You leave him. You have to leave with her. That's all now. You should not. He gets confused. Mother, pull your finger out. You should take care of me. You should respect the Mother for this. I do not have any assistance. When he comes along, he is very much larger. If I can make any mistakes like this, your mother should excuse me. Nana, I excuse you. You do the last one.

Congratulations. I wish you again, happy married life in Sahaja Yoga. May God bless you. Now, those who have to give presents, first the mother, father, all of them will give. Then one by one you have to come for giving presents. So they'll be sitting here. This is the marriage certificate. After this, the marriage is complete, according to law. Now you must write the names also. This is the certificate of marriage in Sahaja Yoga. This is the first time you've written the names. Namaskar. Today is the mother's birthday also. Ramakshi's mother's birthday is also there. What a day for that. Now you have to write the names. This is the place where you can eat.

London people. To the bride only. What about the bridegroom? She died. You must open and see that. What is in there? This is the place where we can eat. Just look after her shot. She is a very good person. One by one is a good idea. That is to the, you see, she is the sister in Sahaja Yoga of Mr. Pile. Whatever she gives, you give it to him, he will write it down. Just see whatever she has given. This bhanda is there for last ten years. On the bhanda, you see, the day when the brother-sister relation is established, ten years back, he accepted her as a sister. All the Sahaja Yogis come and come one by one and congratulate. All of you. Now you have to stand up for a while. Yes, that's the punishment. He is the boss of Kamakshi. Thank you.

This happens through the living process of evolution through the living energy that has made us from amoeba to human beings. This happens through the living process of evolution. From amoeba to human beings. Still with human awareness we cannot know the absolute. All the rituals have said that's the eternal and fit the transitory with understanding of its limitations. But they have failed. They have deviated from the right path of evolution when it is said that you have to be born again. By taking process of evolution as if you are born again in any form, you do not become that. You have a mind that has to take place in us. Things have happened that has to take place in us by which you become empowered. As human beings we understand what is heaviness, what is beauty. In the locker of doors he can easily walk through any dirt again. He doesn't see the beauty also. He can easily walk through any dirt again. He doesn't see the beauty also. But human beings know that, just as But still we do not know what is our benevolence. We do not know what is right and what is wrong for ourselves. And even when we know that this is not good for us, it is destructive. Still we cannot help it because we become powerless. So you cannot understand the absolute truth through mental position. Because the mental position moves in a linear direction and as it has no substantial support of the reality, it co-insides and comes back to us. We do not know what is right and what is wrong for us. So whatever we have achieved so far, whether it is your country or any other country, they have only the knowledge of the tree. But we have not the knowledge of the roots. But we have not the knowledge of the roots. And if we do not have the knowledge of the roots and we do not know how to nourish it, this tree will definitely one day fall out. Those countries are over developed and it seems they are very, you know, you should know that they are in a very big mess. So one has to be Spirit oriented, not power oriented or money oriented. So when you become a Spirit and you feel the All-Pervading power of love, all your problems get solved automatically. First of all you become thoughtlessly aware. If you want to think, you will think, otherwise you won't think. Thus you become a very peaceful person. People talk of peace, of foundations of peace but if there is no peace within yourself, how can we just talk about it? Last time when I came to Warsaw, it was at least sixteen years back or maybe fourteen years back. I came with my husband. It was the first of September when we came here. And in the plane I felt so, so unhappy, so sad from inside as if that was here, was full of very sad people. Even my husband noticed it, that I was extremely sad. Then we discovered that that was the day Warsaw was bombed. And I happened to also see your black maybe's procession here on the eighth of September. It was a great thing I said that the Polish people are so brave, they have resurrected their country again. They picked up heat and every stone and every brick to rebuild it. And nobody could have felt that it was so badly bombed. Coming back today again, I was wondering how I am going to feel about this country which has suffered so much due to war. But it's much better now and I think we have now a chance to be in the realm of that love which will completely make us forget the past. It's been few years since I Try to recognize the past. It has failed me already and now is now a period ofL Jai Radha. Jai Radha. Jai Radha. Jai Radha. Jai Radha. Jai Radha. Jai Radha. Jai Radha. Jai Radha. Jai Radha. Jai Radha. Jai Radha. Jai Radha. Jai Radha. When first I went to Russia for this work, there were about 25 Germans who came down to give realization to Russians. I was very happy to see so many of them who came to give realization to Russians. I was very happy to see so many of them. And here also today, I was so happy to see so many of them waiting for Me at the airport. And I was very happy to see so many of them who came to give realization to Russians. So we have never used the power of love. We have only used the power of liquid. This all-pervading power of love, that's all the living work. We see these flowers, we take them for granted. But just imagine, they come out of a little seed. You never even think how. I will take a seat and sew it in the Mother Earth and sprout spontaneously, sir. We don't have to really think in the Mother Earth. We don't have to really think in the Mother Earth. There is no obligation at all because it is a nature and the seed has the built-in quality to spelt. In the same way, we have also within us this little power which we call as Kundalini, which is placed in the triangular bone called as Sekhram, meaning sacred. The sacred bone is called as the sacred bone. That means the Greeks knew that this is a sacred bone and it has some sacred power in it. It has given us tremendous results when Kundalini was awakened in various countries. It has given us tremendous results when Kundalini was awakened in various countries. This is the power of pure desire. All other desires are impure because we never feel satisfied with them. But when this power manifests itself and passes through our centers ultimately through our fontanel bone area, then your attitude changes. First of all, you improve physically because you can't do anything without your physical being. Because you can't do anything without your physical being. In India, in the university, there are three doctors who have done research with Kundalini awakening. And they have got their MBBS, that is doing after their MBBS, they have got MBBS on subjects like asthma and physical fitness and epilepsy, high blood pressure. But you can't cure blood cancer, cancer, even AIDS. If Kundalini is awakened and the connection is properly fixed, you never get sick. The energy is all the time flowing in you. The energy is all the time flowing in you. You never think of your age and you can go on working all the time. Whenever you want to then sleep, whenever you want to then work, there is no problem. You have complete control of yourself. But when you become empowered, then logically you can understand on medical terminology everything that you are doing. You don't have to be a doctor for that. When you get your realization, you can feel on your fingertips this All-Pervading power as cool breeze. As if you become a cosmic computer. And you can diagnose what's wrong with you or what's wrong with others. Because you become, again I say become, collectively conscious. As you become part and parcel of the whole. And this collective understanding makes you feel that who is the other? And this collective knowledge can be used to help you. Of course, mentally you get all right because as I have told you, we have pure epilepsy and madness, many mentally retarded, small children. You have to be aware of your mental health. You have to be aware of your mental health. You have to be aware of your emotions and your mind. You have learned a complete integration of your emotions and your mind. So, you have learned a perfect, perfect, inner integration of your emotions and your mind. And you see the wisdom of living a beautiful life. And you have to live a beautiful life. Once it happens, you become a personality, very dynamic and a quality of sympathy, a compassion. All this starts with my question. It has the power to be able to see the world through the eyes. Such a person, every piece. Even a glance of such a person. Even a glance. Even a glance of such a person. Even a glance of such a person. Even? Even a glance. Yes. Even a glance of such a person. Even a glance of such a person. Can manifest great things. Even a glance of such a person. Even a glance of such a person. We have to only know one thing, that it is our right to ascend and to become the Spirit. It is our right to be united to this power of love, which is so dynamic, which is so intelligent, so efficient. And it is our right to know what glorious thing we are ourselves. All this is at hand. All this is at hand. And we all have to just ask for it. Still today is the first thing. I would give you some time for you to ask Me questions. But they should be relevant. I have not come here to give you any sermon or to tell you about what is wrong with you. Or to tell you that you are not a person. You are a person who is not a person. Or to tell you that these are your sins and all these hard things about you. Or to say that you are not to be punished. On the contrary, I am not here to tell you that you are not a person, you are brave. But in that state, by God's will you know what you are. So I have a question that you don't have to feel guilty or in any way inferior to anything whatsoever. As human beings you are the epitome of evolution. And you have to respect yourself. By no means to condemn. You are the epitome of evolution. I have come here to give you what is your own, which is hidden from you. And there is no obligation at all. You can't pay for it at all. How much do we pay to God on earth? How much did we pay to Christ? All those people who take money in the name of religion are also in the way sinners. We have to build human beings as great temples. Okay, I can get it here. So everything is ready, just it's a matter of connecting the instrument remains like this. So far we have had talks, talks, talks, talks, talks. But we should now have the actualization. For today's introduction I think that it will be sufficient and if you have any questions please ask. The whole of Srimadaji is very vague. Srimadaji, the question is what do you understand by confidence between people? What do you understand? What do you mean by the fact that people should have confidence one to the other? What to another? That's one to the other. See, when we are in darkness we don't know how we will get to each other. And if the God is in the darkness we can travel over each other and convert others, we will. But when you get the light then you know. And you enjoy each other very well. And you feel happy and joyous. In the same way Spirit is the source of light and joy. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes, yes. Srimadaji, I was talking before about very nice people. I said that Lenin was very nice, so was Lord Goksha. And he said, well, how Lenin I was talking about that, yes. And he said, how come Lenin was very nice person and he allowed mistreating and killing and everything else. Lenin when he was definitely realized so low down but he was lonely, he was alone and the pressures of the pot as also on our pajamas, you see, all the pressure was there. Even that is happening now, you can see so clearly. Like Christ was crucified, Romans was given poison, I mean all of them suffered so much. But he had a vision of a stateless state. Lenin had a vision of stateless state. Yes. So now we have to create this great race of people who are realized souls. When I started my work there was so much of intimidation and so much of criticism and everything happened. And even my family was so frightened about it. But now we have so many surgeries. She says that she felt very well all day and now she said that she felt all day very well but now she has got a pain in the heart. Why is it? She is anxious to live for realization. The tiniest question is, Ching is LSD? So it's not about putting Americans. He is asking Mother, what is LSD? LSD? What sort of action it does and why does it give the reactions? He says what is LSD is? He knows the drug. Yes, but he knows it's the drug but what does it do? I am not taking the drug. It is LSD is something you will understand that once you take all these medicines, they are read or just through you, either to the left or the right and two or more are to take to the left and the right side that we have. See your attention is say like, like study of mind and is spread like this. So sometimes it can move to the left or to the right and tomorrow I'll tell you what is on the left and what is on the right. The LSD takes you to the right. And right side is the five elements, means of the five elements. And also the five puzzles, if we lived puzzles of these five elements, we feel it as we start moving towards the right. Or it is a hallucination in a way because it's not reality. And once you get used to it, you cannot, you do not have power to get out of it. Always your attention tries to push the right. What is realization? Your attention is pulled up like this, you see, like that, goes up. Like if you push it up like that, it goes up. And you get into the center, not only that, but when it pierces through here, the awareness of the dump starts going as cool vibrations. I've never taken LSD but we had many people coming from drug addiction like that. People mostly take it for their seeking, the total. Or sometimes they take it out of the freshness of the illness. Yes, please. The question is, what can you explain about death, reincarnation and hypnosis? Death, incarnation, hypnosis. Hypnosis. Hypnosis like the... It's a very long subject, madam. Hypnosis is very much against us. You stab through some black magic as you call it. But inside your mind you will not ever think. But inside your mind you will not ever think. She is referring to Kashpirovsky. She has not mentioned Kashpirovsky but people here very much associate Kashpirovsky with hypnosis. And Kashpirovsky Shri Mataji was giving his lecture here in the same hall. Oi, pajaya! Oh, in Russia I have learned so many people. So many children have watched you. In Russia, there are two people who have been living in the world and have been living in the world. Many children have got brain damage. If they want money, it's all right but the way they ruin people is simple to understand. He is asking the question, how do we know about him? How do we know about the fact that he is ruining people? Because I am telling you, if you believe Me, I am saying it Myself, I am nothing against you. I am your jurisdiction in Russia. I am your mother trafficker in Russia. Yapany Chatty She is very happy that you are here. She wanted to find the guru and she wanted to go to India. And she has impression that India has come here and she has found the guru. I'm not a guru, I'm your Mother. I want you to become your own guru. When you become the spirit, you become your own master in the wrong time. Shri Mataji, it's a typical question. How come that you raise a Kundalini? How did you come to it? You cannot do it. First you get your realization and then you will know what you can do. You see, if you ask me questions, I can go on answering them quite a bit. I want to ask you, what is your realization? It is just a mental acrobat. But I allow you to ask because I want you to be free to ask, first of all. And say that, at the time when I'm giving you realization, I don't want you to sort of your mind to stand up again and say, I have this question. Yes, but Shri Mataji, I want you to ask because I want you to be free to ask. I want you to be free to ask. You see, I want you to be free to ask, but you have to do it. I want you to be free to ask. And even if I answer your question, then you know guaranteed that you get your realization. That's a different thing. Yes, and now Shri Mataji, I want you to ask, what is your realization? You have to do it because you want to be free to ask. You have to do it because you want to be free to ask. This is what I want you to do. Break. Break. That's what I want you to do. Shri Mataji, she is asking the question whether she can get realization after initiation in reiki. Initiation of? In reiki, reiki, reiki. Reiki. All kinds of problems, you see. Those who are into anything have got it, but you have to have pure desire to get your realization. It works. If there is problem, can be corrected. She is talking of the... Just come here, please. Yes, yes. She is talking of the... She is talking about Lenin and Gorbachev. She is talking about Lenin and Gorbachev. She wants to say something about this. Now, just now forget it. Let us have our realization and then we understand that. Shri Mataji, you are the creator of realization and you are the person who is the creator of the matter. Actually, you see, before realization you cannot know what is the truth. That's one thing. She is talking about the fact that she is a chef and that she can get realization. Supposing, you want to know whether somebody is a realized soul or not. So you ask a question like this to this all-pervading power. When you are realized soul, when you are realized, and you start getting tremendous cool vibrations, you say, yes. You are not a realized soul. You are not a realized soul. You are a person who is a realized soul. You are not a realized soul. You are not a realized soul. Shri Mataji, you have one or two questions if you like, or just realization. I think one is better. Ok. Ok, back. She is asking whether waking Kundalini is not dangerous, number one. Number two, if before getting the realization why one should not clean oneself by dropping alcohol, cigarettes and eating meat. Now, see, it used to be like this, at formatting they used to cleanse all the centers and then raise the Kundalini. And it used to take ages, sometimes three-four lives of people. But anybody who has no authority, I would say, the authority of Divine tries to raise the Kundalini, will definitely create a problem, no doubt. Now, the modern sahaja yoga, for which I have understood human beings, has got a other dimension. That first the Kundalini rises through the innermost channel called as Bhagavananda. And then, when it is little bit connected, it starts seeing, a human being starts seeing also himself in that little light. And now you are forefathers. And now you are forefathers. Now, the moment you start to see the process of realization, you are always looking for something, you are not looking for something, you are looking for something. What is the meaning of this realization? I am still others. The moment you start to see the process of realization, you are not looking for something.

You are not this body, you are not this mind, you are not this condition, you are ego, but you are the Spirit. And then it's all-pervading Power which you will call as the Power of the Holy Ghost or you could call it as who? As Parabh Jaitanya which is doing all the living work. And this has worked out our evolution to this stage and that we have become human beings from amoeba and ancient. Now we have to become super human beings, what we call the saints. And within you a built in energy which you call as Kundalini, when it is awakened it pierces through your fontanel bone area and you feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost and also you feel it around yourself. That is the actualization of your fact. In reality it is not just talk or just harmony. What's the question? I just have to say where the Bhagwani it comes from. Now they still have some time. Shri Mataji, you still can say, you still can say something more about why it is important that they come. It was one minute but... But they say that they still come to them. Where do you have to go? I don't know. I don't know. What is the change? What is the change? What is the change? What is the change? What is Shri Mataji's now? I don't understand but they say it was a bit too long. They would like to have it a little bit shorter. It was 60 seconds Shri Mataji. They would like to try it again on 40 seconds in just to say. Yes but don't move the wheel. They asked me what we could cut off but... They asked me what we could cut off but I would not like to cut anything which is there. Maybe you could... If you could now cut again and say it was in 40 minutes. 40 seconds. You said the last part of it you said that it. Last part of it. Can you play it? Have you got it? Yes. Can you play it out? Yes, they can do it. It was simply... Last part of it, all right. But what happened there? It's all right. It's the usually part. Can you push that there? It's just to suggest something here. Can you push that there? Shri Mataji, if you could do it again 40 seconds it would be very... They would prefer it. They would not like to cut you because they are scared that they would cut too much in a rough place. All right. But they have got me some time. But I can't move any further. I think this is money we have to set. If they can't cut out brother's programs, why don't they cut out brother's programs? Is this money for them to stop? We will see later on also. I say, you cannot, this subject is so complicated, you cannot say that it is a But it is so important, you know, all other things and all political things are so linear. It is important. It's not all of them. There's not many more ones to say, I mean, I don't know how to deduce it. I know. In Russia they give it, in Russia they give it three minutes and not only this for, I mean, sometimes, one hour sometimes. I want to show her the article in the I just want to show her the article in Russia, in the space. I want to show her very different. She is afraid that they will not allow her to put it on the screen because it's too long. But I'm going now to go to the television and translate it into Polish. They will be able to, in the TV office, to replay it and then I can translate it into Polish. The shortest I mean, the shortest. I don't speak very fast. Thank you. Thank you. Tonight's manager, they promised to do the two cameras in a different program. Because there are different programs in the TV. And they want to get two cameras to live in a different program to do one hour program. Eleven. Yes, but this will be on the 6th of August, the number will be on this one. The other one. This one is going to be a five o'clock. This one, now five o'clock in one hour and a half. Thank you. Thank you. I don't know how it's going in here. I don't know. I think I have a problem. It's up to you, living on the soft chambers. Ah, I know that. It was a soul output in the military and you have quite a big output in the military too. Are you a doctor? No, I'm not. I'm a scientist. What's your name? Jennifer. Biologist. It's a very difficult area. It has an effect on children and children become one light and blind. There was a case in England, they are now asking the government why didn't you inform us to go ahead. But on any soft treatment company? It's only where normally this illness is better than illness, is animal illness, but now it's not rooted in humans by the dairy products generally. So the cheese can be done, but only soft cheese. Is the mother in line on that? That's a fresh one. Yes, but fermented. Camembert. Camembert or other soft fermented cheeses. Which one are those? French, French. French. Green, green. I could never eat. Never. I used to burn myself. Never eat. But you know mother, you tell us don't eat these cheeses and one year after it was a big outbreak in Central America, but we stopped to eat hot food. Hot food. The hot food. The hot food. Especially the green ones. The green ones. How can you eat? It burns the tongue. And they smell awful. They smell as if you are in a comfort for brother. But you don't smell it no more. It's a life. I want to smell it. Life was love. I can't. They are really becoming part of the culture. It's like a message. Like that. It's like sulphide. Hydrogen sulphide. Like that. They punch and all of it. I think even because of drinking too much their nerves are dead. They can't feel anything. And the French drink too much. That may be the reason. Their nerves are dead. It's seven o'clock, nobody on the road enough. Nobody. We were going from Delhi to Paris. We wanted to know the way. Not single soul. They were all drinking in the houses. Very nicely celebrating religious drinking. Nobody was there on the road. And their skin have become just like the skin of a lizard. The liver gets all attacked. All these things are made to work. Not only cheese. But also alcohol. You see, fresh. If you make the fresh one, you can't make it. I can try it. You maybe need to wine. Because there is a great juice. Because to make the wine it has to be rotten. What is to that. But the Western mind thinks that he made wine. Never. It's a great juice. And water, if it is vibrated, it can taste like great juice also. It's not the same style on the market. Same design. Yes. It's the same. All the stick more and all that. I have the seeds here. I'll eat your ideas. It's much better. We have the seeds here. The fountain seeds. So I'll go through this. So what is the solution you have given? Don't eat the cheese. It's not very soft. It can be hard also. You see the green in it. That is green. Looks like something like the copper. You might be putting copper to make it that green. You think so? How do they achieve that green? Until they found the special green. That kind of fungus. All right fungus. But that fungus they introduce there. But this is the fungus which decides on the copper. You see the copper sulphate looks greenish. And when anything is in copper, say a statue or anything, when it is sort of damaged, it becomes the same green. And because of copper within us only, that most of the viruses act, especially these aids, because of copper. Aids has come from what country that was? Zambia. Zambia. Zambia. Zambia is the one that produces a lot of copper. And that's why the monkeys got it. Now if you can reduce the copper in the body somehow, with some other higher element, you can work it out. So why put the disease into yourself? Perhaps maybe that is one of the reasons that you get so many people of ages in the West not to do that. Because we don't eat cheese at all. I mean, Indians don't like cheese at all by any cost, except for the craft cheese, which is also soft, but doesn't have anything in it like the fungus. There are too very few Indians like that. You must be knowing the origin of cheese, how it was formed. You see, what had happened, that once, I don't know which country, but it started raining a lot, and people forgot that they had put some milk, big jars of milk, in one of the cages. They just forgot about it. It rained and rained and rained. After, say, some months or years, it went down, and they saw these jars there. So they opened up and this pungent smell was coming. And then they had become like this cheese. That's how they discovered the rotten ones. Actually these jars were open, I think, they were open, and this cheese was formed. Since then they started raining. But once you try to eat everything that is fresh, right, rotten things, even alcohol. Unless and if you rot it, you cannot get alcohol. Also the viruses attack mood to such people. Unless they become very melancholy, unhappy people. It has an effect every way. What is neurobenia, is the reason. It's the 10th general way. It's the diminishing of immunity, human immunity, linked with air pollution and water. Just like any other virus infection. But according to Sahaja Yoga, viruses are all the plants, microscopic plants or other plants, or maybe some microscopic animals, or animals who have gone out of circulation of nutrition and are in the area of collective subconscious. All these things affect you more when you drink, because by drinking you go to the left side and to the collective subconscious. And when you go to the collective subconscious, these things are happening. The first thing is to reduce the immunity, or any thing, like food war. Food war is not the problem, it's a drinking. I mean it is the culture here, you drink, can you imagine? When they eat food they drink with it, I mean, as if it is food. The point of the Sahaja Yoga, you and me deal. Some people ask, what do you say to cheers? I say, we don't have any custom in India, what do we say? Cheers, we don't have the custom on the table, if somebody brings a bottle or a glass of, nobody will eat food. Lots of westernized people have started offering this before dinner. I don't know. No question. It's also because of the ego. See, they want to run away from the ego, they see they're ego and that's why they must be wanting to drink, to go to the left. Right there. Next question. The question is, why I don't know what, is that they get very badly lung infection. And the children especially, they can go in one after the other. What we want to, if we are going in the hospital, they are given anti-pulmonary. What is the lung? Pneumonia. Pneumonia. It is something we can do again in the hospital. No, no, pneumonia one gets, when you ask the others. They have got their baths. You shouldn't give them a bath and take them out. In the primary part. Before sleeping, you can give them a bath. And also, you see, you should rub their backs. What will you do when you feel pneumonia? In India, they take out the yellow of their eggs and put it on the head. In fact. Also the center heart. You work on center heart, it can work on. Amsar center heart. But only thing is that, don't give a child a very hot bath and then take it out. Or else, even if you have given a child a bath, you can take it out anywhere. Then you give it a little milder half. It's not very hot. It's very hot. But it's better not to take them out after a bath. Child must sleep and then he can. Normally, Shri Mataji, normally the Sahaja Yoga woman takes the children from the bath and gives them massage, very massage. And I think that is the cause of this problem. In our country, the ASEAN is a very cold country and if you are doing something, then you can cause this problem. You can give them a bath and put it in with a hot oil and get some sort of a system. Just put the oil in your hand and put it over the heater and then you knock on the food. And you should use olive oil or mustard oil and then give them a bath. And vibrations and the tend to happen half-time. Yes, I know. Clear messes. Clear, clear messes. Also you can, when they go out, you do something to them. Always the children must wear something inside, like a slip or something like that, like a undershirt, always there should be one. What's the matter? But I am seeing the dresses here, you don't give a child to wear an undershirt. That's not very important. There should be an undershirt. In India, when the child is born, before that, what we do is to make an undershirt out of our saris, what we call, which are very soft, out of them, from the very beginning. That has to be there. Because this is, in our country, the hygiene is not there, it's very unhygienic, it will be in a very careless manner. But all these little things save us from it. Especially in winter time massage them with a heater and oil. Also you should never use coconut oil for massage. Very poorly. Just use the mustard oil or olive oil. Olive oil. Olive oil is very good for hair also, right? Yes. We use butter usually, you know. Usually we use butter for body. Butter butter, pre-tipped. Yeah, mixed. During summer time is all right, but winter time, pre-tipped. We use ghee in India, but not for the hair, never. You can make ghee also. But olive oil is hotter. You can get mustard oil here. I think it's actually mustard. You can't make it from India. No, you can't. Mustard oil will make your skin more sort of tiny. It's good. It won't make you that big face. It's good. Shri Mataji, can the adults do this mustard oil? The adults. Can I use it? That is only for the child. Mustard oil. Very good. Everybody can use it. But your hair is the best. If you use mustard oil, you will never lose your hair. Never. But just use mustard oil. You have already lost. Because you can stop using mustard oil. Also your hair won't become white. Mustard oil. Very good. This is a new fashion after you enjoy. In the former do you see any film or anything American film? No, it might be a nice image. New fashion. I think this must be people who want to sell beets. They must have said, all right, tell them what to do. It's nice for us to sell the beets. And hats also should not be used too much. That's not good because you just stop the circulation. You can use something like karagul. Yes, that's what I mean. Is it a good one? A good one. Karagul. No, it's karagul. It's karagul. It's a very good one. It's a very good one. How do you protect in winter the children? When the cold weather is outside it's very cold. How do you protect if you don't wear a hat and it's very cold weather? I told you, you should wear karagul style. Loose weather. But best is to wear balun tawa. The balun tawa and on top of that. You know what is a balun tawa? A luna? It's a wool. Completely closed on top of that hat. What do you say? Pass moutania. I don't know if she will love the children. I don't know. Pass moutania. You see there, most of the people who are in the world are actually Hindu. Yes, yes. The eyes are excited. The eyes are excited. The eyes are excited. For skiing. For skiing. For skiing they use a hat. Japanese are the best. They have no shape. They have no inhibition. Once I went to Japan, I am the owner of the Hitachi. He came to see me and I wanted to. And he had a big white pincer and a bear. Snout. I looked at him and said, what's the matter? I took white bag going like this and he was coming out. I was quite embarrassed. But he looked up on the nose here. I said, what's the matter, I've got... He said, no, I've got food. In Japan, when you have food, you have to go there like this. It doesn't matter. You have to give the lady your information. That makes me wonder. Oh, he lives. Ah, he lives. He lives in Germany. He lives in Germany. He lives in Germany. The flight will be leaving tomorrow evening at 6.30 from here. I don't know where it's landing. Is it Germany or West Germany? I don't know. Let me call my guest. He's going. All right. Hello. Are you going there? What I was saying, you must advertise in East Berlin. Then it's all right. We'll be arriving there in the evening sometime. West Berlin. There's a house of someone. There's West Berlin, you say. All right, that's it. I'll be there. I'll be there. I'll be there. I'll be there. I'll be there. I'll be there. All right, that's it. I hope I have used my house to do that. So how is everything now? All right. All the time we've got to go to the West for East Berlin. Can we get flying? Now it's uni-caught. Just get me to the other room. It's like two o'clock this weekend. I cancelled my program. Is verse 40 that we can get these falling willow strip from the canvas? I mummed that that. And I dissuaded myself of that because that's what you need. But when I say this nation's free we can get it. All right. Let me ask one more question. What's the name of this one? This is Katsu. What's the name of this one? I don't know. What's the name of this one? Mughalaya. Mughalaya is a time of 9. Mughalaya is a time of 6. He's driven by a car. Dibiya. Dibiya. Dibiya. But this will work for 11 for that. Oh, okay. There are two other attachments. Yes. I have kept them on the back side. I don't know what's happening in Romania. Romania yesterday they had a big pacific demonstration. And the student many protesting but no incident. What does it say? Well, they want also this name of the chief of the student to be free. Still they have, they say, about 700 students are in jail. It was a very big demonstration. Are they not going to give elections and things like that? They have. Then after election the fellow had a relapse. Yes. And he called these people from mines. We were beating him. So now they are having a trial against these people, against these mines people. The miners. But what was the need to protest against this man? What was he doing? Well, because they feel that more or less they are still the same people than before. Ceausescu is not there anymore but the same style. Well, it was, he came up because at the time of Ceausescu he was fighting Ceausescu. But he is more or less on the same line. Same style. I understand. It's why he is a So now who is there to fight this fellow there? Basically the young people now, the students. But what is the surety that they have not become a saint? Okay. Russia has taken the loot off. Because I don't understand how he has still to prevail and to press the doors of Russia. Oh, Russia. Okay. Because Russia is one of the republics. But he got after he resigned from the party. Now he resigned, yes. So now he has to. I don't know but in India if you fight an election on one ticket, on one party, then you can't do something else in India. I don't know about that. You can't change your parties. Can you in this way? Well, yes. Now he wants to form the party himself, the new party. So they say it's a very historical moment. After seventy years. But then he will have to fight the elections again or not? No, because the election was a political election, not a political election. But it was done by the communist party. No, it was elected by the population. He was holding the communist party. Yes, it was on the radical side. Progressive. I think you should be asking the guy now. Because after all you see no more in the party. Because the Pargachem is still maintaining the party or not? Pargachem, yes, Pargachem. He is still the secretary-general. And Gorbachev is asking now to resign the membership card. Membership card? Of the communist party? Who him? He asked Yeltsin to resign the card. How can he carry on? Gorbachev then you see? Well, it's double, two different areas. Like Gorbachev, he is the president of all the old Soviets. But he is also the secretary-general of the communist party. If he would resign from the communist party, still he will be the president. Because now the communist party abolishing the... Is one of the parties? Yes, abolishing the Article 69, now is one of the parties. And it's not any more the living party. It's quite a lot older. It's just an American party. It's getting old. Nothing clear for it. They'll have to make a constitution and everything. Yes. Activizations are frightened of change. People are having a nice time. That's what it is. But democracy means quite a problem. Yeah, although conservative area, they don't want any innovation because they were nicely enjoying the bureaucracy. They were given three houses. They were told you can take your flats, please. But you have to maintain. So they said that we do not. Very nice car, all sorts of food and rooms and everything. So nobody wants to take the house because they said we can't maintain it. They said we don't know how to... They don't know anything. I don't think they have. Hello. She tried to get it as long as it was, but they didn't allow it. So they are going to cut out after you said that we have this... We are not this equal. We are not this equal. We are not the same. We are not the same. We are not the same. We are not the same. They cut out after you said that we have this... We are not this equal. We are not this conditioning. We are the spirit. And all around us there is this all-pervading power. And around us there is this all-pervading power of the whole. Of feedback. So anyway she said it's not a place... It's not a program which can explain things, but just throw at people that this sort of a thing exists. And they would say the Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi has arrived to Warsaw. Two meetings, not conferences, two meetings with people, with the population of Warsaw and today... Already without it there are so many people. Yes. So yesterday Shri Mataji there will be another... I said what's the problem of the vertical scale? I said start three candles. I thought you were three candles. After some time our feelings became better, better, she's back proper. I said now we are all right, we can go. She was quite...slowly, slowly she goes. I said forget it, you don't have anything here. Get up and walk. And she started walking. She was walking so fast. And after that we got into the car. We were going by car. We saw her walking so fast that she... And next time, next day she came... I was the one, I can remember, I was the one who made the order. This man was sitting yesterday, he was on the hall yesterday during the program. His, her brother-in-law was there yesterday and I asked him to sit closer to the way where you would be passing so you could see him. You should come the day after. Yes sir, the day after. No, tomorrow. You got it? He's bald. He's a small boy? He's bald. He's not the same man. No? No, he's not the same as somebody else. There was one boy who was a small boy, I thought. But the boy which was, for example, this morning, he is born in a family of divorce, now they are divorced, the parents are divorced. And he has got some problems with mind development. He's retarded, mentally retarded and he's just going too far, physically speaking. And I think the reason was, one of the reasons might have been that both of them were doing all sorts of yoga's. They did, you know, four or five sorts of yoga's. And there is a very well known old actress which has started something which is called the Academy of Life. And in this Academy of Life, she, to show that she's very open minded, she brings all yoga's. Whoever has anything to say about yoga and good, this sort of thing. So she invited us and I said to give a series of conferences. And I said, well listen, we would love very much to come but there's one thing. We cannot be next to the others because the moment we tell the truth, we cannot say that there are other ways to get to realization, there's only one. And if it's not this energy, there's nothing that's related. So, you know, there's no point of having a series of conferences because already on the first conference we have to tell the truth. And these people would, she might ask about others questions about, what about this yoga and what about that yoga and we felt vibrations in this yoga and it's all the same like sahaja yoga, you know. Yes, that's a good question. If we assume that there are all the Indians who are not discussed. Soft and tough. Comparing Shri Mataji to the West or to the Russians, how do they pose the public, the general public, which you have in front of you, how are they? I compare to the West of course that's how the time goes on. But I think Russians are... Deeper. Another question. But most of them wanted realization. It is difficult to say at this stage. But I think that, say for example, in Russia if we had three thousand people who are on call, there would have been a real riot. In Kiev we had five thousand I think, or four thousand. Four thousand. So many people. Yeah, in Kiev is already more towards Poland. Why? Why most of the people in the ground is Russia. And Kiev is too much already, Kiev used to be Polish at one point in time. It's too much of an influence already. It's too close to the West. Ukraine and Ukraine, yeah. It's true because Kiev used to be Polish and the UNIs used to be Polish. The very council is trying not to. But it's beautiful Shri Mataji, the church is trying to get involved in everything now, because this makes people upset. So they go again. That's a good point about all the people. They are getting spooked. Yes. It's five o'clock, we can do the city. Five o'clock is coming. Yes, it's the city. Good night, all. Good night, all.

Yes, they are going to be all right. You are going to look after them, is it? All right. What's happening? Feeling fine? Feeling fine? Are you happy? When she has two months, my teacher says, Hello, is it? Hello! Understand the feeling. Yes, that's the bottom. There are many children like that. Yes, there are so many eyes. It's all right. All right, all right. Open your eyes. Eyes are what? Open your eyes. Open your eyes. Oh, third eye. No, no, no. That's the same. Ah, ah, what's that? Diana. Diana? That's what the night says. Ah, feeling better now? Yes. What's that? I don't know. What's that? It's a little bit. Ah, now what about this junction of Yogananda? You have to do something about it, you don't mind. Get rid of it. It's horrible to be so young. You see, I think you know, but they don't. What's it? No, there is a river there, but it still is a river. But it's cool. Yes. Why is Yogananda bad? What's bad about Yogananda? He was not real actual to the woman. You can see from his book what he writes is that he went there, he saw this thing and he met another yogi and he did games and that happened. What about his show? No knowledge. And apart from that from here he got ideas, these funny ideas of butting their hair and putting a... It's not traditional. It's not Indian traditional. You are not to leave your family, you are not to become a sannyasina, it's not Indian traditional. It's some sort of thing they have taken a clue from, I think, even Ram Kishad did the same, I mean, we wake up. You observe, you see, you don't have to give up anything, what can you give up in the name of God? What is so great, what can you give up? All false ideas. You give up these, you suffer these, nothing, you don't have to do anything, you just create a life which is balanced. Don't go to extremes, in moderation, that's all. Why will God ask you to do all these things, to shave your hair, otherwise why did you give me the hair? Shave it? You understand my point, but it's logical. You can see what I am saying is logical. Lower hand. When you are doing this, you are doing sat nubu or sat haramicha. Sat nubu or sat haramicha is the plastic bag. You are doing it by yourself, you are doing it by yourself. You are doing it by yourself. You are doing it by yourself. You see, Ramana never took us anywhere. She never took us anywhere. Even all the girls were married. Have you said anything? Have you alright? Yes, Mother. Is everything okay? Yes. Is that okay? It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. You have to do hatchery. That is you have to cut the tongue, put it back here, touch it here. Rajyobha, He said. Early disciples are in India, still wagging their tongues, you know. They can't speak, nothing is felt there. Later on I think people must refuse to do that. And this is the skechery business, you see. It's like when the Kundalini rises, something happens within you. Naturally, you can see, a pula-luta happening. And when She rises, there is a contraction and then certain chakras are going to contraction to hold her up. Then if they relax, then... Just like your parashar movement of your, say, interphal, all right? Something so spontaneous has happened, that is raj. At that time also when this chakra is opening out a little bit, your tongue is pulling, but you don't feel. You don't feel, just a little. Now once the use of pulling the tongue by artificial methods and you'll be like moving a wheel of a car and saying that, let the car drive. See, when the car will start, it will drive by itself. By doing that, what you are not going to achieve, the result. All artificial things. You see, you can see, artificial things. You can see, in the photo of her left hand, she is looking at her right hand, and she is looking at her left hand, and she is looking at her left hand. Now, often somebody who Travels around wants to go onto the's garage wooden floor, so she has to showers the whole thing. She was shoulders. You just Kaboom. You will never see again what happens there. Does your coordinate tape. Yes. What happened? We've beenifice to fix the sten killy. No. No. Eclipse is here. You can see it. It's a river. It's a river.

The mother is the most confident. I'll take it. I'll take it. No, you can't see it. It's a river. It's a river. It's a river. And the left hand side is the most confident. The right hand side. I'll take it. Now come. I'll take it. I'll take it. Now, how are you? Did you feel the full breeze? Yes. I'll take it. I'll take it. Put your left over here and right there. It's a kind of a misterism they work out. You have been to all for the same person? I'll put your left over here and right here, down. Left hand. Left hand towards Me and right hand down. I've got she's dead now. How many she has lost? How many she has lost? I left very quickly. I left very quickly. It was only a week or two weeks. Not only her stay with one her desire. All her patients are, all her desire was heart. Patients of Anand Maima, who are all her desire, high blood pressure, kidney trouble, liver trouble and heart. She came to London to see me. Now one more is coming. Brahma Kumari. Or they have arrived or not? They have arrived. Already arrived? They are in the name of Raja Yoga. That name there. They have arrived. They have arrived. They have a place in Adelaide Mother. They have strange ideas. You should use your brain. Your brain is good. You should not yield to any of these strange nonsensical things that they talk of. But people take to them, I just don't know why. They say that they have come to see me. They have come to see me and they have come to see me. They have come to see me and they have come to see me. They have come to see me and they have come to see me. Now better. Are you better? Feeling anything? I do feel quite good and I'd like to feel even gooder. Better. Yeah, but are you feeling the cool breeze is the point? Yes, I can feel a cool breeze on and off. I had quite a strong churned up stomach and that's just about gone. Yesterday or today? Today. I've been sitting here, I've been putting my hand on it. Which was done? So put your hand down there, right hand. And you just say, Mother, I am my own master. I am my own guru. You read too much? Do I read too much? Did you read too much? I do read quite a bit. Forget it. Probably all these books. Mother, look at the girl. She looks a different person. She looks a different person. Got it. She's the teacher of teacher. I think you put your left hand, right hand on the Mother. Right hand. Left side is very lethargic. Now what else you did? I mean, see over and all that. Been to Sri Chinmoy's group. I left him too. I left him too. In my afterwards. You know Baba Ramdas from Ninkarola Baba? He's his son. I better take out all of that. All right? You pull up.

Block is here in the head. All right? I'm saying that. Just say, say it. Loudly you can say it. Better now. Only thing you have to learn, the method, the vidya, the knowledge, how to work it out. That's all. Otherwise your spirit is there. You don't need a guru. All right. The heart, your heart. Put your hand on the heart. Better? One more method. Are you all right? You have been to this guru. That's why you are feeling it better. What about you? Aren't you feeling? Good, hey? Now you should look after this Adelaide Centre here. Master this heart. I hope to send some of them here from Sydney. They'll work it out for you. But you should not import anymore. Import any Sahaja Yogis. Now you should become yourself great masters. Is there anyone here who's got a big house where you could lead it all? Half an hour away. You're very welcome to come here. It's just that they haven't established a centre yet and they're needing it. It's all right. It's all right. It doesn't matter. Half an hour away. But then you find out some other place, you see. Is there anyone else got one in closer to town? Did you take down their names? Yes, they've done all that for us. I'm up the hills. You're very welcome. That would be good, really. Come upstairs and have a look. She has to save so many of them. Did you? Imagine what an attach is from every sort of thing.

We can arrange that. In Cambridge. In Cambridge. In case if you find that they're going to London and this is going to take too much time. Because if you go to London now, say to London and then to Cambridge, it will take four hours for you to drive. But supposing you go direct from here to Cambridge, then how much time will you take?

But in India you'll find out it's not plastic. Ah, in some English houses they can't. Yes. Are you okay? Are you okay? Are you okay? Machindranath. What's happening to you? Ah, I'll just catch a breath. Machindranath. How are you? Is he all right? He was better last week, Mother. He seems to be better last week and it seems he was less good here.

They're called the Manitos, something like the brothers. No, you told Me some names on the phone. They are the same. What some people are trying to do all this? They seem to have attacked.

So then what did, are you still in the same house? At the moment, yeah. Is it? So Alan was thinking of arranging some place, Alan. He was saying that there would be a place together. What about you people? Who else? Rosie and William. Rosie and William. What happened? They are looking for one. They are looking for an ashram in Bristol. Where? Rosie is looking for one in Bristol, in Ashram. In Bristol? Yes. People don't. On rent you would be, it would be. Yes, but landlords don't want people with, who are having children and also there are a few of us who haven't got jobs and this doesn't help either. Oh, you can manage. Why not give them also the same thing which you are doing for Bristol? For Brighton. For Brighton? For Bristol, the same thing. Just see this kind of a thing. It's a very good thing if you can work at Chris. Just see. Have a look at it. It's very interesting. And that is how we got, I think. So that you can use this Sahaja Yoga co-op as a base. Hello. Now. Hello. Hello. So your name is what? Samuel? Samuel. Samuel Marcus. Samuel Marcus. Samuel Marcus. So what should we call him? Right? What should we call him? He's very strong Mother. Like Samson. I sometimes think that's what we should call him. We have no Samson. First of all Simon as Samson, many things. I was called him. But he should have another Indian name for him. He is the most powerful thing. He's got very good heart. Very strong heart chakra. He's got very good heart chakra. Sorry, right movement. The right movement. The greatest bhakti. Bhakti is the highest. Hanumantha is the highest in bhakti. No greater bhakta is there than. Your Krishna has praised Arjuna. But Hanumantha is divine. Hanumantha is the greatest bhakta because you see Arjuna is a human being. But Hanumantha is bhakti, is so great that he's a God. Gods have their own powers despite that this devotion is great, isn't it? The ones who are Gods who have this bhakti. Human beings can have. Anjaneya, Anjaneeswara. Shri Dharah is good name. Shri Dharah. Shri Dharah. Call him Shri Dharah. Shri Dharah. Shri is what he was. Dharah is the one who sustains. Thank you Mother. Shri Dharah. Shri Dharah. Is good name? All right? Shri Dharah. And you see I named him William and this also he is named as William. Just look at that. I think now everybody is going to call everyone William. And now you got Me. This is Marina. Marina. No, no, no, no, no. What happened? What happened to you? What? You have to be hurt. You have to be hurt. Last time I touched you. Why did I? Why did you touch me? No, no, no, no. What's the matter? Same thing is it. Does she keep all right? Somebody else could. Why do you say? Why? Why to cry? You didn't go to any guru or anyone. But I hope these horrible people are not working on here. Did you take? Did you meet them? Those people? No, no. Not you never took children there with you? No, I think it was in Chile Mother. I've never been to Chile. But they are back now here, no? Mother, they operate on dead spirits and they can, if they think of somebody anywhere in the world they will crush them. That's it. But then about the child's birth or no? They don't know nothing about Marina. She's catching on the void. Left, left Sadhishthana, I don't know why. Mother? Mother? We've been living with a little girl and she's catching very badly with Sadhishthana. Her little girl and Mother. She's My brother's girlfriend's daughter Mother. My brother's girlfriend's daughter. She has a very bad left, Sadhishthana. What does she do? This is your Mother? Nothing Mother, I don't know. I think she's just a model. Model? Model. That's so fine. You better ask her to get out. How is she in that house? Mother, we had to move from our house so we had to move to where my mother was living for two weeks before we could move into the ashram. Oh, I see. But now you are no more there. She'll be all right. Now see this modern business is dirty, very badly. It's very not special. Hello. Hello Marina, why did you cry? That may be the reason there's a lingering effect. Last time also I remember. One more. Let's see if she gets it wrong. Marina. That's it. Thank God you're out of it now. I'm sorry. How they attack children. You see it's very inauspicious to go for modelling and selling your body like that, isn't it? Models are nothing but just the very poor type of women. Why should you do it? I just don't understand. I'm sure she'll be all right now once you get out of that place. Wow. Look at this one. It's a tiger. It's very often broken. It's very often broken. It's very often broken. It's a tiger. It's very often broken. Come, come, come, come, come. See the smile is very... It's fallen off. That's it. Everything to be vibrated. See that. That's it. That's it. Now remove it I think. Now remove the chana. Remove everything that is at three feet level. Now. Don't break it. How old are you? He's just finished some kind of similar because he got croup. It's the Shri center heart. It's breathing at night. But he's much better now. He had a bit of a breathing. When I worried more he worried more so I stopped worrying. You see if it is hot you should not suddenly expose children also before that. It's very treacherous crunching as well as... I find I don't know whether how hot he should be and yet it's overheated sometimes. It's very difficult to know. No, you see people suddenly in India say now such a country but forty days so they never allow them to even to see the sun and should that extend their... Hello Marina. Are you all right now? Are you better? You had a bad liver I think. Yes. Also would penicillin worsen it? Yes. How are you? You rub My right foot. You are yourself a liver being led to what else did you raise but your child. How is your speed? Both of us. Better now? Rub it hard. Rub it with some speed. But he's not bad by the way. Give me some. Junior, they are all sitting there. Yes, he is not good. Machindranath. You know that's your name. Hello, hello, hello. So full of life. So full of life. He's much better? She's become very normal. I think we'll have to get Suzanne also there. Does she need to rest a lot physically? Catherine? No, I don't think so. She's all right. She should not. He may not have brought up all his wind. He may not have brought up all his wind. I fed him not long ago. Yes he has. He's rolling. It's rolling. Machindranath. You're rolling now. He's going to put me back on right now. Hello. She gets normal. I see they have everything. Stupid, like stupid person she cries now she has to be. So for what? For what has given you everything? Still you cry you always thank God, isn't it? God has blessed you with everything. Why should you be unhappy? Then be unhappy if you like it. Let us have it. This is the main problem. You never understand what God has given you. You make everyone unhappy. By being unhappy you make everyone alone. I must tell you one news about the Jew. There's one Jew in Australia who taught Me in Australia. What's his name? What did you say? Mr. Rabbi. Mr. Rabbi. He's finished there. His name is also Rabbi. He's a Rabbi. Do you have like that Rabbi's cares? Rabbi is the title, isn't it? Yes, it can't be the name. His name is Mr. Rabbi. No, no, no. That's the title but I don't know his actual name. I just thought maybe his name is Rabbi. Oh, good. Are you better now? Last finger. Yes. So these new people have gone away, have they? Are they going to come? I think some of them are already here. Some of them are having lunch. What is dawn? Is dawn here? He's not, he's no more. Oh, dawn? You are going directly to Spain? From London or you are going back to the U.S.? Directly. Direct now? Tomorrow, no, tomorrow evening. Tomorrow. Tomorrow evening, Mother. Dr. Singh was telling Me this that day that there is some writer who has written to you that as a powerful electronics, as a powerful electrical machine is there which makes everything even strong, he said that some spiritual power is going to come which is going to make others spiritual or something like that. But I don't know what he said. That writer and another one who was saying that he was a scientist who has talked about it. When T.H. Green, you see, he was telling Me that T.H. Green is the person who has done lot of research about Shri Mataji and He speaks just like a Sahaja Yogi. Have you read T.H. Green, any one of you? So also ask him about this T.H. Green because he did his thesis on T.H. Green and Vivekananda, no, T.H. Green and Shankaracharya. So you might be able to get information about that. That's one of the things you should let us know because somebody is doing now a thesis, then he is doing thesis on yoga so we can bring in all these things. Secondly, what has happened about those ceramics I sent from here? Gavin has had a letter, Mother. What is it coming? They have the letter from the agents now, Mother. They were just going to collect them and he wrote them there. They have got the permission? Yes, and they have brought it, they have got it ready to the shop in the best commercial district in this room, the little shop as well as the ascent. And they came here from the ascent around the shop Can't hear you, please. Well, first of all they have got the letter from the agents so they can proceed with customs clearance. They have not yet got customs clearance. Secondly, they have got a property in the best business area of the city for a small shop. And thirdly, they have got the ascent somewhere. But they wanted to have it for the opening ceremony, they told Me. Well, it looks as though they will. It looks as though they will, Mother. See, first they should do the opening ceremony. In the center they wanted to invite people from everywhere and they were going to have an opening ceremony in that way. Then they should go to this place, to the shop. First of all it is to start the center even. They wanted to have some ceramics. Isn't it to start? Yes, Mother. That was the idea. To start in the place we went to visit. And then if they want they can start a shop but just now that is the best way. And you agreed to. The idea was that they would open that, they would have an exhibition of the ceramics you sent them. Ceramics. And they would invite all sorts of people who were well-lured. I mean, to write to them this was the idea. To invite people for a new type of ceramics being created and an exhibition of that and that they were saying we will invite many people for that. That's what they are doing now. They are not there but I can see all that. But I was thinking if Don could talk to Mr. Singh and ask him who is the ambassador in Portugal, I don't know who is he, Indian ambassador. If he would oblige them by opening the center, by opening the ceramics. Because it's Indian ceramics, Mother. Yes, we should not call them Indian but Indian style ceramics. That's it. They are saying that we got training from Indian people or something like that. Not far from here. All right? So if, just ask if somebody can inaugurate, you see, because he has a very nice place for that. Then the whole thing will come up to a level. What have they offered you as a job? Translator. I'm filling in for his translator while he's on holiday. Translator. Translation of what? I think letters. It's for two and a half months. Will she for us date him? What about Girard? What's the situation for him? Did they say anything? What's your wife's position? Did you once see her? What did she say? She's just waiting for the baby. She's just waiting for the baby. She hasn't said anything about someone. But now baby is expected when? In October. Long time. October. October. So about two months more. By that time you can find something for me? So give him all the addresses, everything, and all the people who are there. You handle them carefully. And I'm sure you can do very well. How are your vibrations today? How are you? I'll leave all English complications in England. English complications. Let's see here. This way please. Are you feeling bad about it, emotional illness at all? No, no. You were burned out. You were burned out. All of you were burned out. Look at this one. Better now? Heart, put your right hand in there. This one. This Sudarshan who has come? Sudarshan? He's come from Derbyshire, I believe. Name of it. This is someone in Cambridge. Some girl in Cambridge. She's come here? From Oxford or from? Cambridge. Is she here? No, she hasn't come. But she's in Cambridge. So Derek said she could not help to show. Hi, it's all right. No, she'll go with you. Is she? She's all right. Because after she's a grown up woman, what is there to be so frightened of anything? After all, Derek is going to be with her. And she's a married woman with two children. One daughter is in the matriculation class. But she's also done PhD in psychology, you see. Just natural. Just the right style for her, right? PhD in psychology has to be frightened of everybody else. Because they live in a pathological world. They have all problems, pathologies. They treat people as if they are all sick, you know. Today, Maureen was telling Me, she went and saw one book that innocence, a myth. Can you imagine? For them, innocence is the myth. The other thing they have is religion is an illusion. It's like opium. It is called religion. What about psychology? That is the God's gift. God is an illusion. According to them, God is an illusion. So how can it be God's gift? This must be devil's gift then. If God is an illusion, psychology must be devil's gift. The way they are destroying everyone. They are destroying everyone. Mother, you do not know how they do it. I'll explain to you in great detail. He himself now is convinced. Now what I'm saying, we'll have another book after your Jungian one about psychology. You and Maureen put together, bring them out in light. See, the first thing they do is they hit the liver, you see. First they let people at weak right sides anyhow. They are all on the left. Then they hit the liver with their, every psychological drug hits the liver. Everyone immediately is put. So then the liver goes. And then there's no, yes, Mother. I mean they all. Yes, it's all these are true. Catches on the liver. Straglulizers, these that. Horrible it is. Absolutely. Liver and void. Then the people have no chance. Sure. Then if they are still, if they still haven't recovered, they shock the brain. See the innocence. And then they go and they catch it with their eyes. They are all on the left. They are all on the right. They are all on the left. They are all on the right. They are all on the left. Mother, I have a dolphin here, twice. So she's dawned. How is she? Not very tired and she's got some inflammation at the breast. And the person is feeding the baby and she's a bit unhappy. Isn't that the first thing the baby? Oh, she is. She's still carrying out. She'll be all right. You love the baby? How bad is this little boy, right? Slowly, slowly. Give it to the mummy. Give it to me. One can give it to the child. You can't give it to the child. You can't give it to the child. I love the baby. I love the woman. I love the woman. I'm so happy. I love her. I love her. I love her. I love her. A bad job. Oh, look at this. You love the baby? Yeah. Yeah, there you go. It's beautiful, isn't it? I know. You love the baby? Oh, it's beautiful, isn't it? I know. Very slowly. It's great. Didn't give any trouble to you. Very nice. He's very good all the time. He's very sweet. The sweet child. Hello. Hold the head, I think. It must be here. Always put your hand under the head. Yes, keep it. Go Athena. Go Athena. Go Athena. So should the other two go now for lunch? They have come back? Yes. They ring a bell. Oh, I see. I can have it with you. Yours is ready, Mother, whenever you like. Yours is ready whenever you like. I was such a habit with us. How are you? I'm a busker. Are you better? No, I'm a busker. How are you, Pavila? Now you know why your thing failed. All right. Come on. Mother, I just wanted to say thank you for my family. All right. I really feel loved. It's nice. You're so much better. You're going to come and see me, all right? Yes. How are you? All right. What about these two? Have they come or gone? No, they're here. Where are they? I'm sorry, you see, why I asked you to go, because yesterday I was very heavy. I couldn't raise the Kundalini. I just couldn't even talk. You see, the weight was too heavy on me, you see. So that's why I said, for Pudya better not have you, because very intensive work it is, you see, and it cannot be managed. But for how and when we'll manage, all right? Rightly you must cleanse yourself, become lighter, and no, who's arguing? Who was the girl arguing? Where is she? Somebody who was arguing before the Pudya? Where is she? Is that Ray? Ray? She must be having lunch also. I think she's gone. The one who was arguing. She's gone? The one from Bristol. One from where? Bristol. Where is she? She's not here today. That's the bell. Nicely sleep. How are you enjoying now? Quite happy? Very happy Mother, very happy. What about your house? We haven't heard anything yet. Not yet? They said they'd consider it. You should find out something like Reggie's. But it would be, till then you can be here, you see. What are they saying? Well, they're saying, you know, there's a lot of people more desperate than us, and that she to become homeless would be the only way to get one. You have to become homeless? Yes. And then we have to go into bed and breakfast until they can find us. When you have to the what? Going to a bed and breakfast hotel until they can find us accommodation. They don't consider them high on the priority list, in other words. That's why China had to go. Yes. All right, now I understand. So, then I think you better do it. In that case, yes. Oh, oh, oh. What? There. My name is not here. I hope you have a big ego. Hello, Shri Bhagavati Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Ki Jai! Shri Param Brahma Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Ki Jai! Thank you very much. It's like a teenage crowd. But did you learn from, I told her how to make, I think, he still knows how to make the garment. I taught her. I taught her. It's very simple. You don't have to involve in it. You saw that picture, Rishka? Ah, yes, Mother. Did I show them? I'll show them. You just show them. It's very simple. I told them how to place them. Look, there's another mukuth Mataji. Another one? We do that often. Still out of there. So they will adapt there. These have to be done also. Hello! What's she doing? Are you all right, Mother? Are you all right? Thank you.

Questioner insoue As you read in the pamphlets, you can see the chakras, and that's the way you're going to find in the meditation, you're going to discover the chakras. The pamphlet is a very important one. It's a chart of meditation. It's a chart of meditation that you can see in the chakras. That's your inner system, your subtle system. It's called the chakras and the channels. You have three channels, the hot channel, the cold channel, and the center. And then you have seven centers of energy, seven chakras, from down to the top. And that's the story of evolution also comes in that evolution of chakras. In the first step of evolution, you have the inner sense. And then you have the creativity where everything starts to be created. It's the second Swadhisthana chakra. Then in the third step of evolution, you have all the material well-being is formed. It's where you can eat, you can find food and rewards in the material aspect of life. That's where the animals, they stop at that level. And then comes the fourth center, is the heart chakra, is where you start having feelings. This is in brief, there are more things also in these chakras, but in brief. Here is where you have feelings, and the father and the mother, relationship. And then you come to the fifth center, is the Vishuddhi chakra, is blue. This is where the human being starts communicating. He can sing, he can talk. And then you come to the sixth center, is the Agnya chakra, where the human being starts also thinking. They can use their thoughts to create things, to solve problems. But it doesn't stop here. It has the seventh chakra, and is the last step of evolution in human beings. It's where you have the contacts with another dimension. That's the state of joy. That's the state of meditation, actually, Satori. And in that level of meditation, you also get connected with the divine knowledge, with the knowledge of everything, all that was created in the world. That's why in Sahaja Yoga we say that you have to disclose. You are your own master. And being your own master also is nice to have somebody that can teach you something also. Somebody that has that deep knowledge of meditation, for example. And somebody also that can be like your own mother, that teaches you, like your own mother always teaches you. It's somebody that can teach you also in that other level of awareness. And that knowledge has no monetary value, because it's the knowledge of the Divine. It's completely free. It's the knowledge of the world. And that's why in Sahaja Yoga we say that you have to be like your own master. So we have a little group of Sahaja Yogis, and we are going to sing one song for Sri Ganesha, that's the elephant gods, and the other song for the goddess Vishwa Vandita. Also just a little parent says, The children also meditate. And that's why my son is like that, I'm sorry. Sahaja Yoga is a beautiful song. I think it's a beautiful song that I can sing. Let's sing that two songs, please. That's the drum player, Toshi Kon. And Hamon is playing. What's this? Thank you. Shubhadam paragam dhamunamat Vishwa Vandita Nirmala Mata Sarva Kapur Kriya Nirmala Mata Nirmala Mata Sarva Kapur Kriya Nirmala Mata Sarva Kapur Kriya Nirmala Mata Sarva Kapur Kriya Nirmala Mata Sarva Kapur Kriya Nirmala Mata Sarva Kapur Kriya Nirmala Mata Sarva Kapur Kriya Nirmala Mata Sarva Kapur Kriya Nirmala Mata Nirmala Mata Sarva Kapur Kriya Nirmala Mata Sarva Kapur Kriya Nirmala Mata Sarva Kapur Kriya Shubhadam paragam dhamunamat Vishwa Vandita Nirmala Mata Sarva Kapur Kriya Nirmala Mata Nirmala Mata Sarva Kapur Kriya Nirmala Mata Sarva Kapur Kriya Nirmala Mata Sarva Kapur Kriya Nirmala Mata Sarva Kapur Kriya Shri Mataji, Shri Mataji, Shri Mataji, Shri Mataji, Shri Mataji, Shri Mataji, Shri Mataji, In this way, in spirituality you grow in two stages. The first one where you are thoughtlessly aware, and the second one is called as doubtlessly aware. You are aware, fully aware, but you have no doubts. Doubts about yourself and doubts about your divinity. And then you realize how glorious you are, how peaceful you are, and how powerful you are. You are filled with passion. This all-pervading power is the ocean of knowledge, absolute knowledge, is the ocean of miracles, ocean of bliss. But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness. So you don't have to condemn yourself. If you are earnestly seeking the truth, it's a right that you have got that you should get your realization. All these centers are for your physical, mental and emotional being, and above for your spiritual being. When these centers go into jeopardy you have problems. If you can cure these centers you get all right. Also you can feel the centers of others. So there is another awareness, another dimension of awareness that comes to you, that we call as collective consciousness. That means we can feel the centers of others on our fingertips. I have to tell you that in Delhi University three doctors have got their M.D. with Sahaja Yoga for curing incurable diseases. When the Kundalini rises, She nourishes all these centers and thus very incurable diseases are cured. By your own energy, by yourself. After your Self-realization you become a peaceful personality, very creative and extremely compassionate. It's very relaxing and you get rid of all these modern problems of stress and strain. I am seventy-two years of age and I am traveling every day. I came yesterday from Sydney and tomorrow I am going back to Hong Kong. It's quite hard because I don't think I travel. Just I am sitting here, I am sitting in the plane. So with this new awareness of collective consciousness we can feel others on our fingertips. Who is the other? They become the part and parcel of your own being. You can cure other people, you can raise their Kundalini and give them Self-realization. We have so many powers within us, so many potential powers which are awakened. It's nothing outside. It's all inside. When we start practicing goodness outside we become fanatic. Because it's not mental, it is beyond the mind. I've met many people who have got awards for peace, who have got peace organizations. But they are very hot-tempered people, extremely hot-tempered. Those who have no peace within, how can they give peace to others? But when you become Self-realized you emit peace to others in the society, in your country. Of course Indians know about it so it has worked very much there. But surprisingly it has worked best in Russia. They were communists, you see, and they have no materialistic attitude. I don't say communism is good. But even democracy is also demonocracy. Communism if it is suppression, democracy is absolute licentious permission. The culture of West is very dangerous. It is ruining the people in the West. As a result these fanatics of Islam and all that have started another movement to suppress. But by suppression morality cannot come, nor by giving freedom. You have to take to the middle path and not to go to extremes. That is only possible when you become the Spirit. In such culture we don't have any suppression. The people have their own discretion and they know what is good for them. As it is you can find it's very difficult even to follow Christ. Christ was a great soul, very great incarnation. But He didn't know what sort of human beings He was pleasing. He said in Bible in the fifth chapter of Matthews that if you use your eyes, one of the eyes is doing a sinful thing then take out the eyes, your own. If your hand is doing, right hand is doing something wrong, cut out the hand. These are rules and regulations for angels, not for normal human beings. I have been to all the Christian nations, I have not seen even one person without one eye or without one arm. Then came Islam. So perhaps Mohammed thought that Christ was strict on men, why not be strict about women? So he said any woman who looks at another man with a bad intention should be buried half way in the mother earth and should be stoned. Imagine women in America, all of them will be under the earth because they are all the time divorcing their husbands. Also he got this shariyat, shariyat, shariyat. Actually it was Moses who brought the shariyat for the Jews. It's in the book of Jeremiah in the Bible. But Jews thought it was too much so they wouldn't accept it anymore. But Mohammed thought Mohammed thought it was too much. I should tell you that in the north of India we have lots of Islamic culture. Under that influence women are suppressed, they have to cover their heads, cover their faces, even Hindus. But the immorality is so great there that I don't know. This suppression can bring in such horrible immorality. Yes I was travelling from Riyadh to London and I went off to sleep. But when I woke up I found all the people were changed. The men were wearing very dandy type of dresses. She said, no. I said then what about these people from where have they come? She said they are the same. They have taken out their chaddar and the men have taken out all their head gears and now you see they are the same in the plain. They did not even wait to go to London. So these religions are not meant for ordinary human beings, normal human beings. I think these are meant for angels. First the human beings have to become angels. They have to get their self-realisation. Then only they will realise their value. Then I don't have to tell you, don't, don't. You will yourself know what is not good for you. For example supposing there is darkness here and I am very obstinate and I have a snake in My hand. And you tell Me there is a snake in your hand, I am not going to believe you because I am obstinate. Till the snake bites Me I will not leave it. But as soon as there is some light I will throw away the snake. In the same way when you have light, how the Spirit, your attention, you become your own guide, your own master. This is absolutely simple because already you've got this power within you. You have to only have faith in yourself. Also pure desire, earnest desire to become the Spirit. Because it is your own power. This bone where it is placed called sacrum, means the Greek knew it was a sacred bone. Sahaja means, sa means with, ja means born. Born with you is this power to achieve this state of selfhood. So now it will take hardly fifteen minutes for you to get your Realization. I must tell you that to Japan I came very late for this work. I am here only for the second time and I apologize for that. But Sahaja Yoga is working in sixty-five nations. I am sure with your understanding and wisdom you will respect your Self-realization and grow into it. You cannot pay for it. It's a living process. How much did we pay for our evolution? Those people who take money in the name of God or in the name of knowledge are actually selling themselves. So now I think you should be pleasantly placed towards yourself. It will take only fifteen minutes. It is very simple, I showed, and is your own. You are not obliged to anyone. There are three conditions which are very simple. The first one is that you have to have full confidence in yourself. That means you should not feel guilty about anything. Whatever mistakes you have committed in the past is over now. At this moment you shouldn't worry about that. Whenever you commit mistakes, of course, you should face it. But what's the use of thinking about what has happened in the past? So not to feel guilty at all. If you feel guilty, then the center on the left hand side catches very much. And you can develop a disease called angina of the heart. Or you can develop what they call as spondylitis. Or might be lethargic organs. So what's the use of feeling guilty? It's a myth. Actually it's a fashion also. I don't know about present day Japanese, but when I met them closely I was surprised that they were hard working but always very melancholy. Always singing songs of separation, this, that, all kinds of very melancholy songs. So one need not be melancholy at all. So the first condition is that you have to forgive yourself and be very confident about yourself that you all of you will get your realization. I promise you that. The second thing, second condition is that you have to forgive everyone. Whether you forgive or don't forgive you don't do anything. It is another myth. But if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands. You torture yourself. But just now at this moment this center on the optic chiasma is constricted like this. And if you don't forgive it won't open. And this Kundalini won't be able to rise. So as it is you have tortured yourself all your life and now at this great moment you will be missing your Self-realization. So best is to forgive everyone. Don't even think about them whom you have to forgive. The third condition is simplest is we have to take out our shoes. Because first time in England when I asked them to take out the shoes they all walked off. They are so much attached to their shoes. But in the Japanese tradition they take out shoes for respectability. And also the Mother Earth helps you very much. Please take out your shoes and keep them on side both the feet because these are two powers within us. You don't have to go to Himalaya, stand on your head fast, do anything of the kind. It will all work out here now. Still I would request some of you to come here in front would be better. At the back side can you come this side? There are some seats. There's one seat. Yeah, yeah. Here there are some seats. Thank you very much. I know little bit Japanese so I should say, Domo aliga, Domo das, gudamaskar. I learnt it long time back. Just here also. Here you can. Now you need not write anything. This is only tonight you have to do all this. All of you have to do it because I respect your freedom. If you don't want to have it you should leave the hall. But don't disturb people when they are just about to get their realization. But there should be one promise that once you get your realization you are going to grow into it. Now as I told you the left and right side are two powers. One is of desire and another of action. So keep your feet apart from each other. You should sit straight, not slouch or go back but sit straight comfortably. Now put your left hand towards Me like this, which is symbolic that you desire not like this on your lap, that you are desirous to have your Self-realization. Now the right hand we'll use for our action. Action to nourish our centers on the left hand side. So now we'll show you what is to be done. Now please put your right hand on your heart and left hand like this throughout. Now in the heart resides the Spirit. Now if you become the Spirit you become your own guide, your own master. So please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. This is the center of your mastery. Within a month you become a master. Sometimes people become within a week. Now please take down your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. You'll be amazed to know that this is the center of the pure divine knowledge. Now please raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen again. Now on the heart. Now in the corner of your neck and shoulder and turn your head to your right. Now this is the center I have told you about. Please put the hand from the front, from the front. Front side. Like this. Not like that, like this. Turn your head to your right. This is the center when we get guilt gets into trouble. You can take out your glasses. It might help your eyesight also. Japanese eat too much of fish that's why their eyesight is weak. But with Sahaja Yoga you can get rid of your glasses. I never had glasses till about five years back when this light all the time on My face. I developed problems. Now please put your right hand on top of your head, on top of your forehead and put down your head. This is the center where you have to forgive everyone without thinking about them in general. Now take back your right hand on the back side of your head and push back your head as far as possible. This is the center where without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, you will have to ask forgiveness from the All Pervading Divine Power. Push back. Now the last center is the most important one. You stretch your palm fully. Stretch your palm fully. It's very important. Stretch it. And now put it on top of the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood. Now the most important thing is push back your fingers. Please put down your head, put down your head. Please put down your head. Push back your, push back your fingers. There should be a good pressure on your scalp. Now move your scalp, not the hand so much as the scalp, seven times slowly clockwise. Bend your head. Not the hand, the scalp. Push back your fingers, push back. Now this is all we have to do. Now please, now please put your left hand again towards Me like this carefully and both the feet apart from each other. Please take it down. Now we have to close our eyes. Take it down, take it down. No, no, take it down. Now put the left hand on your lap. See that your both feet are apart from each other. Now put your right hand on your heart. Take out your glasses, it's better, because now you have to close your eyes. And please don't open them till I tell you. Please put it on the heart. Close your eyes please. Now here you have to ask a very fundamental question about yourself in your heart. You can call Me Shri Mataji or Mother, whatever you like. So now please ask a question three times in your heart. Mother, am I the Spirit? Ask this question three times in your heart. Please put your hand on your heart and ask the question three times, Mother, am I the Spirit? Now please take down this right hand in the upper portion of our abdomen. Don't open your eyes. Now press it here and ask another fundamental question about yourself, Mother, am I my own guide, my own master? I have already told you that I respect your freedom and I cannot force pure divine knowledge on you. You have to ask for it. So please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen and press it hard. Here you have to ask Me six times, because this center has got six petals. Please say, ask, Mother, please give me the pure divine knowledge. Six times. As soon as you ask for the pure divine knowledge the Kundalini starts moving upward. So now we have to enrich our higher centers with our self-confidence to open them. Please take your right hand now in the upper portion of your abdomen and press it hard. Here you have to say with full self-confidence ten times, Mother, I am my own master. Please raise your right hand on your heart. I have already told you at the very outset that you are the pure Spirit. So now here you have to say with self-confidence twelve times, here I am the pure Spirit. Now raise your hand on to the, into the corner between your neck and shoulder and press it and put your head towards right. I have already told you about this center. When you feel guilty it goes into jeopardy. So you have to forgive yourself, because this all-pervading power is the ocean of forgiveness. It will dissolve all your guilt. So here sixteen times you have to say, Mother, I am not guilty at all. Say it sixteen times. I have already told you that whether you forgive or don't forgive you don't do anything. And if you do not forgive at this moment your Agnya chakra won't open. So now please raise your right hand on top of your forehead across and put down your head. Here you have to say from your heart, not how many times. Please put down your head as far as possible. Please put down. Here you have to say from your heart, not how many times, Mother, I forgive everyone in general. Now without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, you have to be, you have to ask forgiveness from the all-pervading divine power for your own satisfaction. So now please take your right hand on the back side of your head and push back your head. Here you have to say without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, O Divine Power, if I have done anything wrong please forgive me. You have to say this from your heart, not how many times. Now the last center which is very important, please stretch your palm fully. Now please bend your head as far as possible and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area. Please bend your head, bend your head. On the fontanel bone area is the top. Please put it on top, on top, not on the back. Now stretch back your fingers, put down your head. Here again I cannot force Self-realization on you. You have to ask for it. So now move your scalp with a little pressure, saying in your heart seven times, Mother give me Self-realization, while moving the scalp seven times, slowly clockwise. Now you have to say, Mother give me Self-realization, while moving the scalp seven times, slowly clockwise. Now take down your hands, please open your eyes, put both the hands towards Me like this. Now put the right hand towards Me like this, little higher. And bend your head and see with your hand if there's a cool or a hot breeze like vibrations are coming out of your fontanel bone area, your own. Bend, bend, bend the head. May be hot. If you have not forgiven that it would be hot. Forgive yourself and forgive others. Now please put the left hand towards Me. Now don't doubt that there is air conditioning is coming out of your own head. Now please put your left hand towards Me and put the right hand again on the fontanel bone area and bend your head. Sometimes it comes very close to the head, sometimes far away. So move your hand and see for yourself. All right, now put again once more the right hand towards Me, bend your head and see for yourself if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. Now put both the hands towards Me again like this. Now watch Me without thinking. Can you do it? Now you have to put both your hands towards the sky like this and push back your head. Here you have to ask three times one of these three questions. First is, Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost described in the Bible? Mother, is this the cool breeze of Matriya as described by Buddha? Mother, is this the all-pervading power of Divine love called as Ruh in Koran? Anyone of these questions you can ask three times. Now please put down your hands. Please put them down, please. All those who have felt this cool breeze on your fingertips or on your palms or out of fontanel bone area, whether cool or hot, you have to raise both your hands. Both your hands higher. You didn't feel? All right. I bow to all of you. Most of you most of the people have felt it. One or two. You didn't feel the cool breeze or hot breeze in your hand? One or two. You did. What about you? All right, one or two persons. Doesn't matter. Now this is for the first time you have felt the all-pervading power of Divine love. Try to understand. Now you have got your Self-realization but don't waste it. You'll find there's a tinkling in your eyes, a light will come in your eyes. Also you can feel with your friends, you can find out if they're cool or not. So we have to grow. And luckily now we have a center in Japan which is not very elaborate but to begin with is very good. And we have some good Sahaja Yogis. Here some of them have come from abroad. But I know once Japanese grow into their spirituality they can go abroad. They can do a lot of good. Now you'll be amazed how your creativity will improve, how your illnesses will go away, how you will feel relaxed. Also you prosper very much because your attention becomes very concentrated. You develop that wisdom, that balance and you start enjoying yourself. So the greatest thing of the Spirit is that it is the source of enjoyment. You cannot get enjoyment from others. The source is within yourself. So you enjoy yourself. That's all is My message. I'm sure I'll come next year again. But before that you try to be collective. It's a collective happening, not individual. As we are part and parcel of the whole. You have so many brothers and sisters all over the world. You are not alone now. So may God bless you. Q. Can you speak about the four words? A. Now enjoy yourself. Enjoy. Q. May I ask you a question? A. Yes.

I mean, it's a real surprise for Me. I knew that Romanians were known for their music talents very much, but in two and a half month and all that the way they have picked up Tabla and all this singing, it's very remarkable. But above all the French imagine, the French. Many a times I told them one line they couldn't say, I was thinking I have to give up but gradually they picked up. They always used to go wrong somehow. But now it's surprising nobody can believe that the French have got such talent and such understanding, impossible. It was a real entertainment for Me, I must tell you. I have forgot that your son singing My praise. I was just enjoying the whole thing as if it's something a surprise, a miracle that you people have picked up so beautifully this Indian music for which people have to work for years and years together. I can't understand in such a short time even the Tabla players I was surprised how they have picked up in such a short time with the mukraas and all that. I was amazed even, I mean I can't imagine this maybe the Kundalini, maybe your own genius nature that has come out and expressed in itself. It's I really, it's such a miracle to Me, it's a real miracle. The grace and the bliss that you are feeling now on the body day is something you have earned it, you have got it. As you may say I am money or whatever it is but you have earned it with your deep meditation, deep understanding of yourself. It's not easy. I wish all the Sahaja Yogis of the world try to go deep into themselves and see what talents they have, what is hidden in them, what they can express themselves. Instead of just thinking that something wrong with them, something wrong with their chakras all the time fighting with it, just know that they are there and it will work out. Like today I see what a miracle it is really. If Baba mama was here you did have said what's this, a new vision of the Gandharvas, of the celestial singers. It might have been last life the celestial singers because I don't know how picked up all these sofas, even impossible feet and even in India some people when they were singing they were not that time so prepared but still some singers of very high quality had come and they said we felt ashamed when we put down our heads the way these people were singing so beautifully in such a short time. So there is some sort of a hidden talent in you which has come up and has now expressing yourself as genius. May God bless you, may your art grow and may you enjoy yourself and may make Me also enjoy so much. Thank you very much, thank you from all of us. Thank you very much. Now I knew somebody from there but I have forgotten his name, sorry, Dili is his name and I tell you he is another genius we have seen. The way he organized the amount of rhythm we have seen. That way I have seen people from Africa, they are very rhythmic, very rhythmic, they live in Africa, they are blessed by Shiva I think the way they have rhythm in them and the way he was make the French take to the rhythm also was very good. He organized the whole thing so well and it was done so well, I mean I was really lost the way they expressed their rhythm. I always say that when people talk of racialism, this, that, nonsense, in America if you withdraw all the blacks and the browns, I think I don't know what will remain there because they have the rhythm, they have the music, they play so well, everything is there you see and without them what would happen in this world, you see so God has created all kinds of beautiful, beautiful things but one should be able to see the beauty and that beauty is so great that without that this one would have been really a boring place for all of us. So it is to be understood that it's all created in great beauty and bliss and we should all have that bliss and beauty instead of superficially living. Tomorrow I am going to tell you about Sahaja Yoga in a very different way because Portugal I always had great attention for Portugal. I don't know why and when I came here first time I was very disappointed and second time also though we had lots of people who came to My program but I found they were not seeking still. I said when they will be affluent they will start seeking and this Sahaja Yogi Thaktha has worked and now I find it's so much changed I can't believe it is the same Portugal and the same Portugal is the way they came yesterday for our program was amazing, I mean you can't imagine so many people and how they were attentive to it. This whole world is really going to change no doubt about it. So on this day we have to wish that the whole world should transform and change into this peaceful atmosphere. May God bless you all. Thank you. May God bless you all.

My son, who I have just put up. I think he came to me about 35 to 40 years back. I cannot say exactly when. And his music and his goggles, all that I remember very well. For a long time, when we went to India and all that, he was quite lost, I mean I could never see him. But suddenly once at the airport I saw him and I was extremely happy to see him there. I had not heard his music for so many days. Then he said that, I would like to sing to you for some time. Again he got lost, you know. And the other day when he got published, I was so happy. Very happy. I was so proud, because I know he had to struggle a lot. All the artists have to struggle a lot. You see, finite Chevy, otherwise also. The Saraswati Pudahri would have always to suffer from the neglect of the Lakshmi. And I used to really feel for him very much that, such a great artist, he cannot have his proper rewards. And that was the time when it had started that the classical music was going down and down and down a little bit, and all sort of cheap music was coming up. But I am so happy that he has been recognized by all the government, as a great artist who managed to provide him with that. And that he has such a good name everywhere. He is a very good man, very innocent person. And I hope one day he will come to Cauvery to give us a music concert. Thank you.

He's saying that we want your health to be alright. I said, I never got sick in my life except for this stupid doctor who gave me a horrible medicine. He was like, hala, hala actually. He's a shiupu, right? What, how? Wow, wow, wow! Are you making it right? I said, you may want to have fully with me. May nice one be with you. May have to please. Thank you. When I come there, I'll just please. I hope it's not too much rich there, inside it. Very good, very good. Thank you very much for coming. May have to stood up. I think he came to Me about 35 to 40 years back and I cannot say exactly when and with music and with guddles, all that I remember very well. For a long time when we went to England and all that, he was quite lost, I mean, I could never see him but suddenly once at the airport I saw him and I was extremely happy to see him there. I had not heard his music for so many days but then he said that, I would like to sing to you for some time. Again he got lost, you know and the other day when he got, God must say, I was so happy, very happy. I was so proud because I know he has, he had to struggle a lot, all the artists have to struggle a lot. You see, finite Chevy otherwise also, the Saraswati Pudary's have always to suffer from the neglect of the Lakshmi and I used to really feel for him very much that, such a great artist, he cannot have his proper rewards and that was the time when it had started that the classical music was going down and down and down little bit and all sort of cheap music was coming out. But I'm so happy that he has been recognized by all the government as a great artist who managed to recognize round time back and that he has such a good name everywhere. He's a very good man, very innocent person and I hope one day he will come to Kavera to give us a music concert. Thank you.

...and we should say we were slaves. So all the saints thought that first of all we must have our freedom. This gentleman who is talking to is also a disciple of the same saint and also he fought and he went into jail and he was tortured and all that just like me and then he there was a sort of a warrant on him so he came in this little place where he established these things where a Gargemara said this is the place where you start it and he said that you break the stones from here and start the foundation. For the people who are, we can say like deep seas, we call them Batkam, is there all the time wandering from places to places and their children have no schools, no place to go to and so they have got children from that area. Look at the beautiful children that they have and these people have done so much for them that they are educated, but the amount they get from the government is very limited as they said it. But still I must say this is so creditable for this gentleman to work it out and now he has been elected as the chairman of these saints. Like this you see there are many small small little little places where the saints have worked for the betterment of people because you see they are so collective. They can't bear the poverty of this country and the way these other people are claiming that we are making people fatalist is absolutely wrong because no saint has done that. All the saints have made them work very hard and to work out their problems and they have also told them what's wrong with the society, what is so blind faith, everything they have told and this is this gentleman I was saying that how they emancipated the society. So they did not go and sit in the Himalayas. They went round all over the places and they have done this work and they are saying you are also all saints the way you are bore all the wounds and all the inserts that were there to your mother. It is very difficult to bear it, but you are all saints proved by now, proved completely by us and not only that but they are saying six months we are watching you, you are really saints because I haven't seen anybody smoking or doing anything wrong. They are very peaceful people and not only that but that they didn't even find anybody having a matchbox and they are very much impressed by you and they are saying that how is it you have made them into saints like this. So they are saying it is said that in the presence of a great saint people can become saints but so many of them they are really amazed at My wondrous work. So I hope they are in a very not in a very good financial conditions, but still they have arranged all these things for you and I don't know what to do for the school, but this school is on My list as there are many other schools which we want to have and when we'll have our etana school or something like that in the projects we'll start to help them. Of course before this I paid from My own pocket about ten thousand rupees to them, later on little more like that, but actually this is just a patchwork. We have to do something substantial for all such schools where the tomorrow saints are getting their formation. May God bless you all. They want to entertain you with some tea. They said please whatever we are giving you please accept it with love and don't go away. Those who got wounded yesterday should go and take the tea first. Those who got wounded because they have to go the inspector of police is coming to take their statement. So please go. All right, so this is what is My work is, we await them their Kundalini first. Then after awaiting their Kundalini, their chakras get shruped and thus they are helping to. We have definitely cured blood cancer these days. There are three doctors who have got MDs. Now they could not have got MD from somebody, a lay person. They must have got it from some very learned and very highly qualified people. Now these so-called Andhra-Sradha people, they call them that we don't believe in God. We don't believe in any saint. They are all these things and yesterday there was an article saying that this is all illusion. At that means all illusion. I mean this is our heritage, you see, and they are talking about the science, talking about the science. Who is such a scientific person in this country, I would like to know that you can talk of science. We have three scientists here now present who can challenge all of them, you see. So unnecessarily you have both the balancing. You see, we have two robes in our head. We become imbalanced and that's why the West has been lost. Are we going to get lost like that? Yes, sir. That's the point. Now I have changed these people completely, I have transformed them. But the fellow yesterday who was there inside, he told all things wrong about them and incited them and he said that these people have come to do all the dirty things here and to spoil us and they have brought all their bad philosophy from there. It's all absolute, nothing of the kind. We have changed them so much, you have seen them how they are transformed and how they are matured. I am very happy you are here, so dedicated to villagers. I wish I could stay here and do some work but the villagers can themselves become very enlightened and they can do very well. And the students have improved a lot here. Students have improved, since they got Sahaja Yoga, their schools have improved, everything will have improved. So you must help the gentleman, he is doing such a nice work and R.K. Maharaj was another one, was a saint, no doubt, but he did so much of social work. First he fought for the freedom, as I also fought for the freedom of our country and then he fought for the betterment of people which I also did and then I started Sahaja Yoga in 1947. When I found that the whole spirituality is going into the hands of people who are commercializing it, I had to stand up and whatever help you need, you are willing to. Where do you live? At the temple which is nearby, that camp, the temple, Oh, there is a room for you? I see. So now you should also understand Shiva's worship is to be understood first of all, how to worship him, how to achieve him. You see Shiva is nothing but your Spirit and all these people are doing that, they are understanding. So we have to understand where are Vishwadhetis and there are also Mohammed Sahabhudinas, everybody is there. So we have to see to the essence of it. I am very happy to meet you. My problem is that when I want to become householder. You want to become? Oh, good idea. That is why I am projecting My problem to My Mother. Yes, you know actually we don't believe in sannyasa because sannyasa is outside but sannyasa is within yourself. You see, now see, I don't know, in this lifetime I was born in a very rich family, married to a very rich man but I can live anywhere. You see Me, I take bath in the river, I live anywhere. I have no idea of comfort and at this age of, and I am sixty-seven year old. So you see the comfort of the Spirit you see. So it's a very nice idea that you have changed and you have decided to become a householder. So next time we'll get you a very good bride. This gentleman who is like a sannyasi and was living like a He is like a sannyasi but practically he was living like a sadhu. Yes, he did take an initiation he says but he was living like a sadhu. He is such a great man, I must say, to give up everything and to work so hard for the people's emancipation and for spirituality. Now he has decided that he will join sahaja yoga and also he'll get married. He's a mechanical engineer. By permission of Meccalija I put dollars of service. Last ten years I fully devoted to Spirit Shri Mataji. Very good. We'll look after you, don't worry on that point. But also we'll get you a nice wife, we'll look after you. He's a very good man. He's a very good man. How many years? 48 years. We'll try to find if he can, you see, we'll find out. It's so sudden now. I'll try to find if possible. They are all very happy. I'll tell you something, I'll tell you something. I'll tell you something. You have to do something. I'll tell you something. I'll tell you something. I'll tell you something. You must listen to your mother. That's the main point. That's all. Now you have to have your dinner here and I have, DSP has asked Me to cancel the Atith program because he's worried about your security. But we'll have our dinner there. We have to leave this place at seven, they said six o'clock so that you reach there at seven, they will serve you food and then you can go to Kolhapur and rest there. In Kolhapur you'll be there for tomorrow, day after. That is the first tomorrow. Tomorrow is the puja, then the New Year puja and the second you'll be there. And third, this Govinda has invited you, he has started a center of his own. So we'll be having food there. After that you can leave for Ganpati Puri, so you reach Ganpati Puri in the evening. All right? May God bless you. Yes, sir. The pens, can I give the pens to you? I brought some pens, can I give it to somebody at the school? Yes, please. They make very strong tea. Must put sugar and this thing, otherwise you can't take. It's extremely strong. It's all right, little bit, I've taken it.

Satsang with Mooji

We have to really thank the English for arranging all this. I don't mean the rain. It has been really very enjoyable, the whole thing, the cooking and everybody enjoying the food and everything. But it's a, whether we were in England or here, it would have rained in anyway. So we shouldn't mind it at all. I tried My level best but it couldn't work out that good as I was hoping to. But here it seems to be perfectly all right and they wanted to arrange a very big heater for you with a gun in it and I said, nothing, doing that would be too much. But for Diwali I think we'll have better arrangements, we'll be able to do much better. You see, that's what it is. Your Mother has come here and She is now staying here. You find it difficult to go away. I have to put this house into proper shape. It's like a stable, I think. Thank God you people are not complaining anything, you just somehow or other managing with it.

But luckily now I've bought a lot of land, which is about four acres. We are going to have really a very good ashram for all of you, so you won't have all these problems anymore. But as it is this place, Kumbhala, a very peaceful place, it's really divine that we arrived here. People are very nice and remarkable the way there is no industry here. I used to wonder how people are living here, which is just like cul-de-sac as you can call it. There's only one road to come in. And that this place we just got it, I don't know, through divine planning. Now you feel very at home here, it's very congenial to spiritual growth. In the beginning everybody has these problems. I was just thinking that if you had to go to Himalayas for your tapasya, it would have been much worse.

It's very sweet of you to have tolerated all this inconvenience and enjoying everything that can cause lot of problems to many. That is how Sahaja Yoga has brought us this joy and happiness. And whatever may be the case we just enjoy everything. If it is raining we enjoy, if it is dry we enjoy, if there's problem we enjoy. And also when we heard that there are still some people who have not eaten their food, we just started laughing, you know, what's going to happen. I mean suddenly we found that everybody has eaten the food and they couldn't understand what had happened. So all these things are so beautiful, it's like we are in the Kingdom of God. This is Vaikunthu. It's beautiful, everybody is so much enjoying everything, every ripple, every flow of life. May be this year be sufficient for us to put things right and also may be next year we might have an ashram here. But whatever it is, wherever we are, in whatever conditions, in whatever state, if the joy is there, if you are with yourself you'll never feel tired, you'll never feel bored and you'll never grudge, you'll never crumble but you'll enjoy everything that is there.

I was just thinking about the rest of the world, you all are enjoying here, what about the rest of the world, where are they, what are they doing? And then you must know we have to do a lot, we have to give this joy to so many more people. So many people are today doing this puja, tomorrow specially, and all the Sahaja Yogis have sent with their best wishes to you and they think you are very, very lucky, though it's raining here, that you are able to attend this puja. People have sent messages from all over the world. So we have to also think of them and think of the people who haven't got their Realization, who are still lost in greed and lust and are suffering so much. So My blessings to you all and also best of luck for this Navratri, where you will feel the protection of the Mother, you see. Navratri is that you thank the Mother for the protection She gave to you. That's what it is. I hope by this you all will be very well protected. All right, thank you very much, my God bless you.

Can you keep it on the other side because this comes in between us? Yes, please. Take this off for the moment. Yes. It was better before. Quality was better before. Thank you.

I'm extremely grateful and honored to be back here to Shri Mataji. And to this heavenly abode. It has been about ten months that I have not played for Shri Mataji. But I have always looked forward to coming and playing for her. And the story this time goes like this. That about five days ago I woke up very early in the morning. At about six o'clock. Unusual time for me. Because I normally wake up about nine thirty or ten o'clock or something like this. And I suddenly thought about Shri Mataji. And I said that I will call and see what is happening. And I phoned Italia. And somebody informed me that of this place. And then I was given the telephone number here and I phoned here. And again somebody said that okay we will let Shri Mataji know. But Shri Mataji had already told directly about calling me here for this time. So this was a very beautiful experience. And I am very grateful to be back again.

Now for six months now I have been thinking that the next time I play for Shri Mataji I will play this very beautiful, very old raag which is not played very much. And I would make this presentation. This is raag, Charu Keshi.

Why don't you give a microphone to Shri Mataji also? Maybe she would like to say. Yes. This is the name of the Goddess Satsang because Charu means beautiful or you can say auspicious and Keshi means the hair, who has auspicious hair. So it's coming from Bengal, Charu Keshi, this word. And it's the description of the Goddess only, it's the name of the Goddess. So the right time. Today is the day when the Goddess goes to Bengal, you see. It's so nice that He's going to pick Charu Keshi which is a Bengali. It's come from Bengal, this raag has come from Bengal. So many coincidences, so many coincidences, you see. Must be something behind it. In front of it. He does it.

This is the manifestation of nirananda. Just enjoy.

I have learned it through ears and through, you know, through voice, but never practical. So I wanted to play this for Shri Mataji as a fresh start.

I don't know. You see, my family has been so much engrossed in classical Indian music and I've been from my childhood. I've been listening to all kinds of people and all, I should say, one of the greatest musicians that you could think of. Perhaps there's no one I have missed since long. I've been listening to people so many times and I've never heard that somebody who has never played this before, never heard such a thing, because they have to do lot of practice called as dias. And there is one raga they will practice for days together. Early in the morning they'll get up and work it out, practice. In the night they will get up and practice. I know this very well. And I'm surprised really it's a miracle again, I must say, that for the first time to play some raga with such depth,ness and understanding. Miracle, it's a miracle. It's all your blessings. Miracle, no doubt. He admits he has never known anyone who has played for the first time so well. I'm nothing. Thank you. He doesn't know. Okay. So, I'm going to play a little bit of the raga.

You see, this raga is called Shahana. Shahana means something which is royal. It's played for royalty. And this composition that I'm playing is actually, it's a composition which is also has to do with rain. But it's rain in a happy surrounding. The raga is played for royalty. Now, you see this you should try to understand in singing that from every sight you see in, I swear to God, the tumor, but means from everywhere as if inspired and making sound from everywhere the black clouds have come. It's so beautiful that in English it becomes little, not so, I should say. But badarya is like a woman, it's not, kali badarya. So he's describing and see now when he plays you can see that suddenly the rain starts very fast coming and then again it goes down. So he's just praying how the rain comes down. Suddenly, you are walking along, say in England especially, if you are going along very nicely suddenly you find out. To enjoy that also is a sign of a realized soul. If you are a realized soul even you enjoy that play, is the play. So the kali badarya is the black clouds but badarya here is a lady, so we can say it's a play of the kali like that you can say, it's a play.

You have enjoyed this but I think I don't know if you have understood the beauty of this one is like this that the beginning of any bandhish means any construction of the tune you see is in the beginning we call as mukhi is the beginning and this has the tapa gaya sahi tapa, tapa dang hai. So this is called as bandhish means the composition, you can call it composition but Indian composition is not restricted to some written stuff but is sort of there's lot of creativity that you can use but if you see that the beginning of the tune as you can call the mukhi, the mouth of it, see is so intricate and every time he had to start with that intricate play you see and then every time also he was changing it but keeping the speed and the style the same. If you see how he worked it out that every time he started the tune he did with that beautiful intricate work.

So you see in Banaras Desavans style of playing is, she used to sing this tapa but I have only heard her that she was not tired. Normally people get tired of singing but it's such a fast number to begin with. So the beginning of the tune or the beginning of the construction is such a fast number and every time you change that fast number but you have to have a fast number and the style is the same. So, it's miraculous how Mataji knows and understand these little intricacies of Indian classical music. And it's really a joy to play for you because you see it's not only the spiritual aspect of it but also the technical aspect of it. Gracias. And in that the expression is of, you see this big artist only can do that and a very great artist can do that because every time you start the tune, every time you have to have a fast number and that fast number has to be in varieties, not the same. It's not the same, you see. So this is one thing you should say, they see now and then the artist has to be very alert and smart because every time you have to have a very fast number to begin with and a variety and your own creativity and all that. So it's a very intricate thing and I hope you all have enjoyed it very much.

How can you do it? You see you have got everything written down and that's what you are playing, nothing so great. Now in this kind of a thing the one he is playing now is every time he starts he has to say something very fast in a very intricate manner and that too every time different. Has to be very wise person to do that. Bananas. So bad. That's a better hand load sir.

For Navratri this raga, udga which is your life very much but you don't know this, this melody has only five notes and on the five notes to play what you call the star is to expand it is very difficult, only five notes and when I went to Japan I was surprised that they were having only these five notes they were playing one raga, that's all, they didn't know anything else and when this Japanese came to India and somebody played turga to them I think it was, but I had to go on there. So, and they were so amazed, gurukali style mein ga udga hai, gurukali raan, they have the same paanch swarom mein guna kali raam, that's all they go on tung, tung, tung, tung, tung, tung, like that and I mean there's nothing they don't know how to expand it but when they heard this turga they were so amazed that how Indians can expand these five notes in so many ways. And you know we were to take them to dinner, they said, no dinner, nothing, we are going to sit here and listen to this. So this is a raga of five notes and very difficult to play it.

Now this turga raga has been played. Now you know that turga is the center heart and bhavani, the one who protects all her children. So how she is expressing, how she is going to protect you and how she looks after you and if you just hear this music with that idea that the turga is giving you all the assurance and all the sense of security and it's how she is trying to put that into her mind. This would definitely have a spiritual effect. Just see from that point that she is the protector. She protects her, she gives a sense of security and she is the mother of the whole universe. So how she expresses herself to suggest that how you are saved and how you are protected. Now listen from that I think.

Keep the rhythm. The Shiva's rhythm is playing and she tries to play the turgas. The Shiva's rhythm is playing and she tries to play her own rhythm like offbeat sort of thing you see between the two and then when they are playing offbeat then she you have to come to the first beat and before coming to the first beat the sixteenth becomes the first beat like that. So and then to again to start it's quite a complicated thing and this complication has to be then sort of followed by the rhythm means by Shiva so he has to also play around. So it's a beautiful play between the two rhythm and the turgas we can say her dance or her play so between the two it's a very intricate thing to stop one beat before. So that's what he's trying to tell us that he's just stopping. So on the beat itself when there is the first beat he doesn't play anything. That's of the silence.

First beat is also the last beat because of the cycle rhythm. Yes cycle. Sixteen beat rhythmic cycle. First beat is also the last beat. So one beat before the last beat. Yes because the fifteenth becomes the first beat first one so the last one becomes the first one becomes the last. Absolutely. Christ the first will be the last. Yes. I know. Yes. You know, there is a pit on the influences. Who's back there?

Because we will be waiting here, but tomorrow we will have to wait. I, because I didn't know about your program, you go to the air. We have to make something clear. It's alright. I'm seeing surgeries when we have to wait. They are more together. There is more time to wait. And they enjoy much more. So it is not that they feel, anyway, boring. I've seen in many cases, if the plane will take, they will all be there. Nice, they sit there, enjoying, laughing. Even if we wait for four hours by go of the night. So, what's what we are going to do? We are going to the ocean, which is called ocean. So whatever we have is all nothing but joy. Outro this ocean right now. So we are already in the ocean. And we are enjoying the place of life. I know there are some some of the animals, the lions, all kinds of things. But still we are in progress. Despite that, we are in progress. And progress very well. With every action in every line. I've seen it, not seen it, but what's so amazing is Mr. Sarath Pareek, I was coming to this room. He said, I have run it. I don't know, actually it's not too late. So the improve the animals that he's living on. That comes through Sahaja Yoga. But you must meditate, you must go to the shelter, you must attend programs, and you must attend. Unless and until you have that help, you can work out that. Many people have become something extraordinary, let's say. Not only financially, otherwise also in position, in all walks of life. And what she's doing. But one thing is there that you have to meditate. Meditation means you don't keep improving. Sahaja Yoga is to know yourself. Unless and until you meditate, you might go there. And you must have balance. That improve meditation. Very important. Otherwise anything happens to you, if you are away from it. Then you cannot move Sahaja Yoga as soon as you have. But Sahaja Yoga really protects, really protects. And how it has happened now, actually. I'm going to Turkey. In Turkey there was a big, big, very big, whatever the description say. And in that, in that, those who, people who were killed, when the people who have been fundamentally or go to the hospital. In that system all of them are killed. And not one Sahaja Yogi has got killed. Not even one Sahaja Yogi. And what happened later, not one Sahaja Yogi has been killed. Not even one house of a Sahaja Yogi has been killed. This is, this is the, the problem of God Almighty which is, you know, Mahadevapriya. He does this kind of thing. If you reject Sahaja Yogi, if you do not get Sahaja Yogi, all such calamities come. Now in India we are a very big country. In that earthquake so many, so many people died. And so many houses lost. There were only 18 Sahaja Yogis left. Because these Ushatis have very many people. They are all the time busy with what you call, shut down people. All the time. And most of them were worried about the action. They would come to Sahaja Yoga. It was hardly 18 Sahaja Yogis left. And this has happened there. And the houses of Sahaja Yogis are just the same. We have one Mr. Martin in the construction building. He had built four miles buildings there. Where this, this, and even if the Mother Earth did not touch this, the buildings were absolutely the same. And he got an award from the government. So he told me that these houses, they don't do it, which have been built for a while. But other houses also, there were some construction buildings, they are correct. But just imagine. Just they are same. So it's a protection. So you have got a protection, you have free walk of life. In any way it guides you, puts you into doctor's shape, from the monastery to the doctor's office. All these works are, in such a beautiful manner, at that point. It's a good act, absolutely good act. So you should have full faith and full solidarity. Try to go deep in the ocean. Now solidarity doesn't mean that you have to do everything, you have to follow the The more you go inside yourself, the power that it brings you will start to express itself. So we have some solidarity, who are becoming very powerful. But some of them, they took money, made money and all that, so that's good. What is the best? This way, knowing yourself, knowing that you know yourself. And then you will be amazed to know that you are the source of, not only joy, but peace. Peace is there. Wherever you will be, there will be peace. You will see the climate will improve. So people will become peaceful, you will be alone. So this is one of the things that you should see what happens with your own existence, how things work out. That is what you have to establish in this world. You have to establish peace in this world. You have to establish love in this world. And you have to see that everybody is safe. It's certain. It's impossible. Because you have to transform people. Full of horrible things. So we have to change. And you have to trust people, you have to make, make, make change. This I think you know. And this I know. So thank you very much for your time today. Thank you all very much.

He said, I have seen Shri Mataji. So what is the other? I have known him that he just goes out to me and comes out to me, it will be a certain person. So then I went and saw, I don't know how it was, then he was one of the ones who were in the world. So he said, Mother, I just wanted to see you. He was there, he had traveled all over the world. Okay. So that's the way also there, Sadatma. All such things are there. But you went in Colombia, there's a high road. And I told Colombia, I said, I don't know. Naampadak hai na, Anandar Maan. You can see. Three people. Okay. Try it. Please, I will be there. One of the persons, for all my work, and possibly the street. No? Right off 75.

Thank you. Adetitwa. Oh, I am really happy to see you now that you were going to go in with bill and then throw your poetry like the other day. She was trying to get BT can. And you're going to go back, come out with the pizza you know. That's how you are here also some laws, running on you. Doesn't matter. It has worked somehow. For all the people who are going to come, okay? So I am going very much everywhere. Because in Lucknow, they had Islamic power for us and about 500 Christians came, they are Shia, and they all got their Realization, 500 of them, and they told Mahdi that from next time they will get to 5050. So it is a very good idea for Indians. Otherwise Christians are all right.

Stay in Benin is a place which is in Taurani. I should think one Taurani government on the West Side. And we have, we had 9,000 Muslims, and now we have about 20,000. And the President of the Asher one called and he is a Christian. So he sent the head of the police to India for our program. And it was very interesting. He doesn't know our language, does he? He only knows French, and the French sergeant can be said. But he said one day, all these seven countries where the French were ruling, and we all had to know the French, the Christian sergeant. So I asked them why do you, and they always repeated, why do you take to Islam? What are the needs to take to Islam? They said because these French were so polite, and they had moved, moral, horrible people. Their wives were all over. So this part is better, this is what we have come again, better to take to Islam.

The room has to take the room. Then we'll take it. I'll take it. Keep it outside. There's one more apartment. We have a wonderful country in this neighborhood by friends. And all these countries have been successful also. And they have shown such interest in Sahaja Yoga. So, you see, once they come to Sahaja Yoga, what are the problems of religious quarrels and fights and all these things? And I think that they are finding it very difficult because they are all fighting on themselves. Where is the, wherever they are in Islamic, what happens is that there's no peace. And all the time fighting, especially. We had then a very big earthquake. In that earthquake all the Pundamati, most of them died. And those black might be all right. So it's very clean now. But they have become now very alert. So we were carrying a wall there, a white wall. They are coming for the first time. They asked us ten questions as to what is our organization is and how to teach people. They have to think what happens. But the other day, last time I met the Abinist's wife, I'm going to tell them this, God, the Shabbat, you know. All both things are not in the world. And I told you when it is up now. Let us see.

They have both the meanings of that. They have learned from childhood to age in their own. They take it, you cannot tell me. I have read at all the Palestine. You know, such at Shabbat hätte, which were always characters, not like the metatriananten. They are wasting around. Anything that seems to have all the family inside, that sense of mystery inside them. That kind of things happen. You know, they are not having everybody. They are quite vigilant, quite important. They are secretly disturbed by somebody, not anyone else. But they are fighting every day without them coming from someone. It's a very country of destructive violence, Afghanistan and all of them, and everywhere. Once they get fed up of it, they take to go and ask. Because nothing like getting your own things, you know, getting your own power. What has happened to tell me they have first? Now, she left. No, but they are not coming anymore. Now, because they have been connected to me. Threatened and then they threatened one Buddhist monk after coming into Sahaja Yoga.

That's a must-have with Jemashar, of course. See, nothing wrong with that. Buddha, great Buddhism after the realization. It's a part of it. That is, after we have self-loving, then only you can change. So, that Buddhism is practiced in China and in India, in the real world. Because Dr. Tao rounds from Chaitanya. He's a Christian and he talks of everything, thoughtless awareness, and everything there. He has taken very interesting, I should say, experiments, by which to be a thoughtless awareness. They are, I'm writing a book on this now. Because in China Taoism is the law. So, if the book is published, they will like it. So, I know one person there who was quite conducting the world to be a prime minister of the world. And they are taking this out. But secretly, later on, it can be very well, I understand. Tao is another thing. Tao is just the same as the only thing they don't know how to reach that stage of Tao. When you can become a sage. If I just say it says, sage does that, sage does that. But how do you become a sage is not that. So, he may never show how a sage behaves and how you should. This is the, if you think with them, vital, people should follow them. It's a way you want to give. And if you follow these things, then according to them, you get the peace, the joy, you know. And it's a very poetical thing. It's all poetry. And I don't know if you will have a time poetical or not. But extremes and extremes there is. From one extreme to another extreme what happens. Very good. But to understand it, I think what I've realized is also something very suitable. India, of course, is going very far. Here at this time, I have not programmed in here. I think there are two laps of people. They must be. But, sir, they prepare also in this day. You can't stand in. So, this is what I'll have for my dad. I will tell you my daughter, that they must have prepared me to do. But they prepared also in the day, to be kept there then.

What are new people here? Raise your hands. So what's with that? Tomorrow he comes. So what is the program? Shmadaji, we are requesting to do a puja. We all want to make a puja. And in the Uddin, we can have a program in Sharia, one of our students in the college, the Catering College of Management. It's the time to have a mystical degree. So, I say Shmadaji, combine the puja and the music in the Uddin or give the puja tomorrow morning. Evening. Evening time, okay? Yes, you are. Thank you very much. Come on. There are very new seekers, Srimadji, who would like to come, and it should be called, yeah? I know. That's why I want to come. They should not be shocked. No, they should not be. It's funny. I'm Mahama, I have a vision. For me, they won't have a vision, I think. But she's always going to be so impatient. You can, you see. Once, it's completely very still starting with the service. So in Dubai, you can see all of them are in the city. I can't believe it. I am not. And here also, you can get there. But then if you have any questions, you can get more liberalized. Liberalized and dead of any age. He loves you. I am Mahama. He was such an open-minded fellow. He looked at them for that. And he was the beginning of the school. They did not have him. But they were fundamental, you know. And then this fundamental is some other. In this book of also Mutlata, you know. It's true illegal. All these people who are being, going to these till now, who are all Buddha. I mean, they are all people, they are stockers, shah, even these people are all Buddha. They are living their name. All the time they will be sitting with a stock. Now since it has failed, they are lost. Very many of it, nothing but Buddha. That's not what it is. I used to always think that you live with people. Now not only is it, but even can I say, I can't believe that. So it is time to find you. So many paths, who are the three hundred paths, they have no reach to me, not reach to India, which is problem.

But India is not fundamental, I mean, it's all you can tell me, it's very simple. I said, I told her, three-seven-year-year-old, I told her, not the time you will find it. I said, I have to do it. But we need it to do it. And as soon as we can, I will go on corruption. There's a list with lots of things now, there's all corruption, very popular. I don't know how people are involved in it. Now there's so much in it. Everywhere you go, there you have to do it. By other means, that way. But from that also, for which is towards the devil, there are so many things. So if you think it will be in the way of mind, even not in it. Yes, but it's going to be in the way of mind. That way. You are not in it. Yes. For this, it's going to be in the way. All he's down for me.

Shri Mataji, four are applying for visa tomorrow, so we need your attention. Oh Shri Mataji, we want you to put your attention on these locals, they took you to take the Sanjeevanda. Yes. The local community, Arabs. They are better than Arabs. At least in Dubai, for the terrible people in Dubai. Here they say that we don't believe in great people and in other people. And what do we do? We don't believe in all the problems and we are quite open-minded. But then we take to Sahaja Yoga. You see, the whole thing is that the student is a very dangerous from which we taught them now. And they don't understand. But they get it as a human being. They don't have much Parma-satum in here. They get their realization. They should move their next class. They are also very engaged in that class. So not the teachers, the general teachers, all kinds of things are the same. They are very dangerous. It's a box from you. Huh? He bought it from you. He must have just cut the picture. How did you know this? That is a little plane. I cut it. Very good idea. The teacher then has the prologged out. Good. The teacher... He must pass. Very good idea to Heart Humanities. Energy is self-警鐘, and after the lecture he wants to click the second part. ..of wealth was happily Buddhist. His successor. Healing purposes is an intervention. Yes. Healing on the spricht. Prevention ofsun is an engineering nightmare. European máquinas.

We have so many Indians here. Most of us are here. At the airport, at least we have 40 percent of them. We have to get to the airport. I told them that there are these people, you know, they are still here because of it. Thank you for coming. Please take me. I have to close at your will. A real loss I can shift in the ani Experian. Set the centimetre into the Mostcati, have to go to the airport. This would be a olduğative service from the world, through the earth, from where people are real. But only problem is that they have not been able to live in life. They are trying in our life, this is trying. But we have schools, they have not been able to live in the school. Not that they are going to live. Got an idea? Any? I can't have a story I guess. It will be tomorrow, please, time to time. Tomorrow 7 o'clock in charge of 2,000. Can get service to you. 7 o'clock. 3,000. So, we'll be here in the next step. 1,000. 4,000. 2,000. 5,000. Thank you.

I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the very outset we have to know that truth is what it is. We cannot change it, we cannot transform it. So unfortunately at this human awareness we cannot know it. In our evolutionary process we have become human beings. But still we do not know the absolute truth. If we had known absolute truth there would have been no problem. Everybody would have known the same truth because truth is one. Same thing as I am sitting before you is the truth. But when we see it is there so you know that's the truth. But when we find people have this thing as a truth and that thing as a truth and then they collide in the name of truth, then we start wondering what sort of a truth is this. So something more has to happen to human beings to achieve that state by which they will know the absolute truth. Now whatever I am telling you before you, you should never accept it blindfolded because we have had enough of it. All these kind of blind faiths and things have given so many problems to us. So better not to believe Me. But keep your mind open like scientist. If it works out then as honest people you have to believe Me. Because it is for your benevolence, it is for the benevolence of your family, your country and the world at large. So now we have to understand there are two truths of which we have to have knowledge. The first one is the fact that you are not this body, this mind. You are this mind, these conditionings and this ego. Because you say my body, my conditionings, my mind, my ego. So who is this mind, who owns this, all these things? That is what is the I, the Self, the Spirit. So you have to become the pure Spirit which you are. That's the only evolutionary stage we have missed. The second truth is we see beautiful flowers around us and we take them for granted. It's a miracle if you see, beautiful these flowers have come out of seeds which look so good, such beautiful flowers have sprouted out of them. Who runs our heart? We never question. The doctors say it's autonomous nervous system. If it is auto, who is this auto? We never question, we take everything for granted. Look at our eyes, whatever, beautiful camera it is and the brain is a competitor. Who has made all these things, how it is made, we never bother. We take everything for granted. It's good in a way because less headed. But there is a all-pervading power of Divine love which does all these things. It is called by various names. For example in the Bible it's called as the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost or the all-pervading power of Divine love. In Koran it is called as roo and in Indian scriptures it is called as parabacha italiani. Whatever may be, Patanjali is called as Ritambara Pragya, quite a big name. Whatever name you may give it. It is a power of love, of Divine love. We have used always the power of hatred. Any organization you take, even religions, they are based on hatred. Actually I read a very funny article that some people who were Jews were denied citizenship in Israel because they believed in Christ. And they had a conference here I was told of the religions and they were having big fights. How can you have fights in the conference of religions when it's not a battlefield? So when we talk of peace we have to know that we don't know our peace within ourselves which we have to discover. Unless and until we have peace within ourselves, how can we talk of peace for others? This all which is described that you have peace within yourself and that you have your Spirit in your heart, that you are to be born again is a fact. But it is not just saying I am born again. You are born again but what powers have you got? Are you compassionate and is your compassionate love acts? Does it act? Does it work? Just to certify yourself as Christians or Hindus or Muslims makes no difference at all. Because with all these names you can commit any sin whatever sin you want. Everybody can commit any sin. Because you belong to one religion you are not prohibited or neither you feel from within. So if you have to be really religious it should be a inbuilt quality within us. It should not be just a brand which is false. So we turn to something which is fundamental within us. These are the centers they have told you about. This is the mechanism within us which is built during our evolution. And now the last breakthrough is to connect you to this All Pervading Power. It works spontaneously. It's your own power. It's just like a candle which has the light within itself which is enlightened. Then it can enlighten many lights. It's like this, this is your own power. This is within the sacrum bone. I don't know what they have told about this, how far they have told. But the bone is sacrum bone, the triangular bone which was surprisingly called sacrum by Greeks means the sacred bone. It's a sacred bone in which this power is there. In some people you can see it persaking like heart when it is awakened. You can see it clearly with your naked eyes. You can see it. And ultimately you can feel the cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area which is you can say actualization of your baptism. It's not some priest puts his hand here and says you are baptized. But actually you feel it and that's how you get connected to this All Pervading Power which is the vital power. This happening is Sahaja. Sahaja means born with you is the right to have this union yoga. So it happens spontaneously like a living process, like the Mother Earth and the seed. You put the seed in the Mother Earth, it sprouts by itself. You don't have to stand on your head and do any acrobatics, nothing, it just stands just by itself. And because it is built in the seed, the sprouting power and it is the Mother Earth who does it. That's how it works spontaneously. Now how much do we pay to this Mother Earth? First thing you must know that you cannot pay for God, you cannot. He doesn't understand money, He doesn't understand banks, He has never known all these things, believe Me. It is a spontaneous living process of your evolution. Now there are many problems people ask Me about how it happens, how it works out. The simple answer is like this. How the seed grows, tell Me. Can you explain? It's just there, it's built in, it's made like that. Supposing this is made in a particular manner and is then connected, of course it has to be connected, then it works. How it works? Because it is already built in. So you must have faith in yourself first of all that this power is within you, is your own power. And that when it is awakened you get connected to this All Pervading Power of Divine Love. Then you start feeling on your finger tips. For the first time this All Pervading Power, for the first time you have never felt it before, for the first time you start feeling it on your finger tips. It's an actualization this was to happen. Now there are certain funny ideas people have about resurrection also, which are never logical. Like they said at the time of your resurrection or last judgment people will get out of their grace and they'll be resurrected. Now just think of it, might be a bone or something getting out of the grave. How you resurrect a bone? I mean you are all intelligent people. This idea prevails among Muslims also. And the Bosnian Muslims who are dying, I am worried for them but they are not. They are saying if we die now in the name of God we'll be resurrected fast. This is the most absurd idea which I find prevailing. But of course this is the resurrection time. And many people are taking birth to be resurrected. They are seekers of truth. They want reality. Many people are born. That's why we are thinking that we are our population problem. But actually all these people are born again just to take their realization. Those take births, reincarnations and they are here. That is sensible to understand. Now if this is the resurrection time what should happen at this time? According to the description of various religions it is that you know yourself, know thyself. The first thing that should happen, you should get self knowledge. You should get, it's not a lecture or a sermon, but you should have self knowledge. What is your self? Is the inner being. You should know your inner being. You should have your inner knowledge which you don't have. Till you get cancer you don't know you are going to get cancer. And when it is very serious then doctors suspect and then they put you into the machines and things to find out if you have cancer. But self knowledge means you know about these centers that you have inside yourself in the parasympathetic nervous system. You can feel it on your finger tips. This is what is self knowledge. Now these centers that you see here are within yourself, all of you. And on the medical term we can say that on the physical side they are called as plexuses. They manifest plexuses but we have other sides also, we have mental, physical, everything. So they look after or they are the foundations for our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being within ourselves. Most of the global problems are because of human beings. Now if you can correct these centers somehow then you can correct human beings and that's how you solve your problems. When this power in the triangular bone called as Kundalini rises through these centers then it doesn't trouble you. You see there are some books, horrible books written that it burns you, nothing of the kind. She is your mother. She is your individual mother. She knows everything about you. She is anxious to give you your second birth. She is not going to torture you by any chance. She loves you and she wants you to have your second birth. So she doesn't burn you or anything, all these stories are all nonsensical. I have not seen anybody getting burnt or anything. Thousands of people have got realization, none of them have said that. It doesn't burn you. So I don't know why they frighten this very negative things to say about your own emancipation. All right. So it just rises. When it passes through these centers it nourishes it. Not only nourishes it, integrates and enlightens them. By that your problems get solved. Of course Sahaja Yoga has cured many diseases. I would not say Sahaja Yoga but I would say you with your awakening, with your own powers. Many diseases like cancer, all kinds of diseases have been cured, there have been research being done. We have three doctors in India who have got their MD in Sahaja Yoga for curing incurable diseases. And there are many doctors all over the world who are doing this. For which you don't have to pay first of all. This upsets doctor a little bit that you don't have to pay. But actually you see how many people are going to come to Sahaja Yoga. Now see I saw so many people now on My way and how many are here? So I mean the rest will go to the doctors, they shouldn't worry. Only the seekers of truth will come to Sahaja Yoga. Only the people who think about those things will come to Sahaja Yoga. So they cure your physical being, your mental being, many lunatics have been cured. You'll be surprised. Lunatics, so called schizophrenic have been cured. Depression and all that. Stress is can be completely cured because I think this thing opens out and the stress passes out probably. It's not a difficult thing to understand that it is a meta science, it's beyond science. So many diseases that we suffer from. I can tell you only one center gives you how many diseases. The second center that you see here which is in white color but is actually yellow. And this center is responsible for transforming fat cells for the brain. One of the functions it has. The second function is it has to look after the liver, to look after the pancreas, also spleen, kidneys and part of intestines. One center. Now when you start thinking too much, if you are futuristic thinking, planning, planning too much, all others, all guns are neglected. So what do you develop? You develop a liver trouble. Of course the doctors can't detect your liver, it's very difficult. Then you get diabetes. With the spleen, because you are very hectic, your spleen doesn't know how to cope with you, so what you get is leukemia, what we call blood cancer. Of course so many people have been cured of blood cancer from Sahaja Yoga, no doubt about it. They are cured, very easily. We have three architects in India who were just declared that they will die within one month's time. Doctors are honest, you see, they certify, you will die after one month. They come to Sahaja Yoga. Now one of them has been told about eight years back, another six years back, another five years back, they are still perfectly all right and I don't think they are going to die till they are at least eighty or ninety, quite healthy. So this is how you get this blood cancer is to be understood medically also, it's easy to understand that this spleen is responsible for giving us RBCs, red blood compressors. When we are in emergency, now you see in a city like Vancouver I have seen people out there rushing about here and there. Early on the morning they get up and they read newspapers, horrible things you see, the emergency starts and the spleen has to produce more RBCs. Then after that they have no time because they get up late so they have to rush, they don't take their breakfast, they take it in the car. And some are also I was told, rushing their teeth, shaving themselves and having their breakfast, absolutely hectic thing. And on the way there's the traffic, finished. That's the end of patience and they start abusing everyone. After that they reach the office, in the office the boss is angry because you are late maybe. So this poor spleen doesn't know how to cope with this hectic personality which starts like this and then ends up into something else and takes them to the other. So it becomes vulnerable. It also becomes crazy, see, and it becomes vulnerable and suddenly if there is any attack from any virus this is settled. So you get, one gets blood cancer and you are certified, that's all. But you yourself become the doctor, you yourself become the medicine and the diagnosis you can do yourself. This is what is the self knowledge. Such a man is very futuristic, you see, very, the higher he goes the successfully becomes, he becomes very hot tempered. Be careful. If you have to talk to them go with a barge pole I think, that's better. They jump at everyone, of course as far as the wife is concerned they have no romance left for the wife. Very hot tempered people, they, even the women, they also become like that, right-sided. Planning all the time, planning, planning about the future which doesn't exist. Ultimately they get diabetes also. If not that then blood cancer. If not that minimum is constipation. That's the first sign from the nature it comes to that. Then also this heat from the liver might attack your heart. In child, is this a young age, say about sixteen, seventeen or up to twenty-five years, if somebody drinks too much and plays tennis or some sort of a game like that, he gets a very fatal heart because of all these right side activities that he is doing. And the liver is out of gear completely and it cannot give out the heat which is the poison in the body and this heat rises all over. Also it rises on the right side on the lungs and it gives asthma. How many diseases we have already had by one chakra. But if one chakra is put right all these diseases can be cured without taking any medicine or paying for it. Once your Kundalini rises automatically you will feel the change coming over you. Transformation, you will feel very relaxed and very joyous. You start seeing the whole world like a drama. I have seen people, very stern people, not only smiling but laughing aloud and I said what's the matter now. That's the change. You get so transformed. Sometimes I can't recognize because sometimes you lose your twenty years of age. Now I am seventy years, I will be seventy-one very soon, you know. I don't know. The age is coming but I don't know about age at all. I am just the same, I feel the same way as I was. I travel so much, everything I do, doesn't touch me, doesn't bother me. In the same way it happens to you. When we are thinking, what we are thinking about the future, about the past. But if I say you be in the present you cannot be. So what happens that the thought rises false, another thought comes and falls and you are jumping on the cusp of the thought all the time. And sometimes the thoughts are so much bombarding your head that you get fed up. But when this Kundalini rises, she expands this spacing between these thoughts which is the present and you become thoughtlessly aware. This is the first thing happens. Thoughtlessly aware. In Sanskrit it is called as nirvichar samadhi. That is you are completely aware but there is no thought. That's the time when you are absolutely peaceful. And in that peace you grow. Your spirituality grows in that peace when you have that peace. And the second state that you achieve is where your connection is fixed properly. Sometimes you know some people have very loose connections. It's like a guru shopping, all right, let's program, let's go there, have a realization. Then somebody else is coming, all right, have his program, like that. You have to settle down. You have to grow. I take life seriously. Like the other day somebody was describing Me about TM. I was shocked at this gentleman, was quite intelligent. He said, Mother, you know what he showed? There was one man who brought one pendulum. He was not of the party and this fellow said, with My power of mind I'll make this man move his pendulum. And he was moving his pendulum. See, I said, I have you come here to move pendulums, what, on this earth? Is that your value? You are a human being just to move pendulums here. You are moving ships and moving aeroplanes and moving the whole world and now you are going to this man to develop a power to move a pendulum? It's a stupid thing. This mind is limited. Why don't you understand? You have to go beyond this mind. And this fellow paid three hundred pounds to that gentleman for moving the pendulum. I mean if people are stupid you can't help it. Like they paid six thousand pounds for just levitating themselves only three feet. And already we have a jam on the streets, you see. And what these three feet people are going to do, I don't know. For levitating them for three feet. Nobody did, they broke their bottoms, that's all. They got their compensations also from the feet. So such stupid things these people want to do, just can't help it. And people are paying so much money to them and spoiling themselves, can't understand. Of course, basically you must have your logic intact. Sahaja Yoga is not meant for idiots, I can confess it. It's meant for people who have some logic in their heads. If they are idiots you cannot do it. This is idiotic, don't you see something? And so many people are doing this kind of nonsense. We have gurus coming just from jail, wearing some sort of a saffron clothes. And people become disciples. And what are they doing? They are giving us mantras. I mean mantras can be given by a donkey also, why do you need a guru? Why don't you think? Why are we here? What are we to have? What is the goal of life? What are we seeking? One should know it and one should understand the value of your human life. You are a human being. You are at the epitome of evolution. You are not here for just becoming like birds or worms and frogs. You are here to become a higher personality, a superior personality, a saint. But all these things are so common. Also Indians are like that, I must say. They can be called stupid, despite the fact he said what is a real master, but still. Now recently, thank God, they have discovered about Satya Sai Baba, how he was mesmerizing and giving peace. Because there were cameras and cameras photographed him and cameras could not be mesmerized. So there's a tape, I have got that tape. They saw him. I mean also think, why should God give you gold or diamonds? He has much more precious thing to give. You can buy them in the street, anywhere in the road. What's the use and those who have diamonds, what are they doing? Are they some special people? But this is the trouble. Then I was told that one fellow came suddenly from India and he had some sort of a home. And fifty thousand Indians stupidly paid for that home. And this one fellow, whose name is Murali Babu, another joker I should say. By chance I happened to be in his program, I don't know how I feel, they took Me there. And he had made one Rama of twelve years and Sita of seven years. See two children dressed up like Rama and Sita. And the marriage was performed. And they were asked to give for the Russo of Sita for the marriage. So all these Gujarati ladies and these Marwani ladies, they took out all their diamonds, all their gold and everything, give it to them. Imagine Sita getting married nowadays. I mean I just can't understand. They said in Bhakti we are doing it. You get Bhakti but Bhakti doesn't mean that you should not have any logic behind the Bhakti. And this man has minted money. They all have minted money befooling people. Now there are evangelists also you have got. I've never seen such a horrible, blatant nonsense than these evangelists. So one fellow in Honolulu was showing a one hundred dollar note that if you give this then God gives you two hundred. How can you say such a thing? God has got a bank on water. Such stupid things people are doing and we are joining them. Keep your logic intact. God is not illogical. You may say there is no God but I think it is unscientific to say that because you have not found out there is God or not. But you have to give little time to yourself and some respect to yourself. That's all. It will work out and you'll be amazed how you will discover how fantastic you are. Like a television set you take to a remote village somewhere and tell them that you are going to see beautiful films and things. They'll say this box, how can we see? This is just a box. We also think that way about ourselves. It's just a box. But once it is connected you see the kind of thing it is, how fantastic it is. And that's what you'll discover how fantastic you are, how many powers you have and how much you can do in this world. I don't want to give the complete list of things. It's too much. People write to Me, Mother this has happened to Me, that has happened to Me. And this Phil Ward who was playing on the harmonium, I asked him, Phil I'm now tired of reading all these things so I send all letters to you, you better sort out and write it down, we'll write a book. Within one month's time he said, they have piled up up to here, now Mother, how am I to do it? I don't know how to sort out. It's like that. So you have to have faith in yourself. You are not ordinary people. You are seekers of truth and if you find it you have to settle down. Another problem about canary elses, I don't know why it is so, that though they get realization they just come and go, come and go. It's like a cinema show or something. I'm still trying to understand why. But in Russia it's different. You'll be amazed in every program I get never short of sixteen thousand people, minimum. And once they get it they settle down, they understand. And I said, it's very surprising and no guru could stay there, even your scorns and everything went full on. No one. Rajree, no one, they all tried. Nothing. They are so wise and so introspective. But I said, how is it? They said, Mother, so obvious, very obvious it is. I was surprised how these people are so sensitive to spirituality. And they understand you can't pay for spirituality. This they understand very well. How many of you, they have had very great writers and novelists and philosophers, no doubt. But on the whole I think even in their writings they have been extremely introspective and that's what is their character. I think this materialism has made us rather superficial. And that's why we cannot settle down. Hardly takes a month for you to master it. But you must devote yourself unless nothing asked for. For this all knowledge, everything, you don't have to pay anything. You never get sick after that, you become a part and parcel of such a big organization of fifty-five nations. You have brothers and sisters all over the world with all these. I just don't know why people don't settle down. So our leader here, Bern, is very unhappy about it. He was saying, Mother, you better shift from bad to worse. I said, but this I heard also in Toronto why it is happening. But I'll talk to them and tell them that this was a volcanic land once upon a time, I think that maybe there is. Mother Earth is still hot or I don't know what to say. But you have to respect yourself and have faith in yourself. Now as it is, the time is going to be nine thirty and I think we should go ahead with Self-realization. Of course you must be having some questions and you should let Me know if you have any questions. I must tell you for the last twenty-four years I've been facing all kinds of questions. I'm quite an expert. I can answer all your questions very well without any difficulties. But it's just a mental acrobat, it's a mental acrobat. You have to go beyond the mind and that's what should happen. Who is this? Ah! You two! They are from Soviet Union. You helped us all our difficulties. Now you better try to help Canadians, you know. Yes, of course. You please arrange their meeting with Me tomorrow if possible. So nice to see you all here. May God bless you! My heart goes to them and they telephone to say that on the streets there's all kinds of fighting going on and all that. So I said, are you disturbed about it? No, why should we? We are in the kingdom of God. Why should we let them fight? These politicians have to fight, let them fight. I think one day all these instant block people will become extremely powerful, very powerful people. They are all very well educated, very well read people, but so humble and so much for reality and totality and I mean I just don't know how they have the right ideas about their city, absolutely right ideas. I think our choices, our freedom, I mean that also has gone too far. Like in America I went to somebody's house. He was supposed to be a very, very rich man, all right? So when I got into this car he told Me, be careful about My handles. I said, why? I've put them the other way now. But I said, why? Why did you put it that way? Oh, that's My choice, My individual choice. But I said, somebody gets into your car, he won't be able to get out. Why did you do it? But then in his house when I went, he said, be careful. If you step onto that, you'll jump into the swimming pool. I said, why? Oh, a smiley sign. I said, nice for you, not for others. But imagine suddenly you jump into a swimming pool with your sari. He's very rich, you know, and he desires it. His styles are different, everything is different. What's the use? But he dresses up like everybody else, like a hippie. His dress is, his hair is like that and this is the fashion, it is very fashionable. I said, in this you are not individual. In this you are fashionable and the rest of the nonsense you are very individualistic, where everybody will be tortured. Can't understand how you use your money. And he himself has to remember all these things which he has done. So these choices that we have, like children in the morning you ask them, what will you have? They should cook, you should whatever you have, who will give it to them? What will you have? Then they ask for something. If you don't have it, then they won't have their breakfast. Is all you don't know a great slavery of these so called entrepreneurs. They make a dress like this and a dress like that and a hair like this and a hair like that and everybody is jumping around them. They have piles of dresses and clothes and things, I mean, you go into a heavy house, it's so lousy because every time there is a fashion coming from Milan or maybe coming from Paris and they must do it because they have money. They don't know what to do with us. And if you tell them why, why do you do it? They say, what's wrong? These punks were using some red thing and they started becoming black. I said, why are you using this? What's wrong? You'll become blind, doesn't matter. Everything is a challenge. Death is a challenge, what's wrong? How about you will die? No, what's wrong? You will die, is all right. Death is also a challenge. Everything is a challenge to them. The surfing, this, that, you see this, all these destructive things that people are doing madly. What do they get out of it? Skiing, one lady lost her kidney, then she lost her one leg. Still she was skiing, you know. I was saying now you'll lose another leg also, then how will you ski? With one ear, I'll ski now. Oh, I can use my hands. But you are a useless woman otherwise except for skiing. What are you doing? So these destructive ideas, I mean they don't know what to do with their money, what to do with themselves, you see. Sitting in the sun, getting cancer, I mean all things, all these adventures lead you where? Away from yourself, away from your home. Holidays now. Holidays is another madness. Started you won't believe twenty years back it was not there. In England holidays start, say people go from Bristol, from we can say from Brighton, from South to North, North people come to South and on the road you can't move. All the roads are finished. They run away, all of them. I don't know why. What is the need? Spend the holiday together in the household, talk to your people. Indians don't do this. I don't know here. They might have become fashionable, I don't know. But normally Indians don't do all this nonsense. They sit at home, talk to each other, enjoy children, grandchildren. What is this running away from the house all the time? Then some another thing comes, you see, holiday thing. Such a mad idea is to destroy yourself. What's wrong? I must tell you something of interest for one minute more. I was in Greece. May I am a simple Indian woman you say, I am. Of course I have travelled a lot but I don't know many things. So the organiser, he had come, he is a young boy, he had told Me, Mother there is one interviewer who wants to interview you and he is the chairman of the gay people. I said, what do I do with him? He said, Mother he is very anxious to interview you. I said, all right. But you know at the right time I forgot, otherwise I have a very, I mean I have such a nice memory. I mean I never forget things. But at the right time I forgot that he was the chairman. He asked Me many questions and then he asked Me, what do you say to people when they are, men are attracted towards men, women attracted towards women. I just forgot that he was the chairman or anything. I said, it is absurd, it's unnatural. But said it happens. I said it happens because people are possessed and I have cured them and they get out of it. They are possessed, yes, I said they are possessed. They don't like to hear about it. They will get AIDS, they will get anything. He was quite shocked you know. And he said, Mother do you think they get cured? I said, I am sure they do. Men get cured faster than women because women have some mental problem. Oh thank God, so men can get cured. I mean he wanted to get cured, this man. And they have shown this many a times there. But I mean if you say something sensible nobody wants to listen. But the worst I hear from England, the canon is saying that we should allow extramarital relationships in Christianity. Why? Because nobody comes to church and who is going to pay for the police then? Then through may I know you allow child abuse, drug addiction, everything wants to come. After all you have to make it popular, isn't it? That's the thing. Whatever is wrong is wrong. But it's not to be condemned but to be cured. That's the point is. We have to cure it and it is going to help everyone. Of course Sahaja Yoga has cured cancer but also it has cured AIDS. But there's a little problem about it which I don't know if I should tell or not. But it's like this the people who get AIDS are two types I've seen. They are very aggressive, they think they are martyrs. I don't know what they are going to achieve. They are all martyrs you see. And the others are extremely difficult and they think that they cannot, they cannot exist. They don't want to live sort of people. So in between you have to find somebody who would really take to Sahaja Yoga. We had five people, out of them two came from TM because they said in TM it was not allowed to meet your wife even. This was long time back. They are marketing different, different things. That time it was the husband should not meet the wife. So they developed this nonsense there. So they went back to the same habits and they died. Their parents are there, they are very thankful to us. And then husband and wife they are all right. And this one who got it nine years back is perfectly all right, is doing very well, is the healthiest man we have, he carries all the heavy bags. That one. But they are very difficult. I think they should get out of this mood and things will work out for them also. So there's love, sympathy, affection for everyone. Not only that you become extremely compassionate but extremely dynamic, extremely creative. There are some artists who just came to Sahaja Yoga and now today they are world famous artists all over the world, specially in India, Amzadali, Sefadu Sahib, Devachaudhuri, all of them. They came to Sahaja Yoga after that and they tell openly about this, that after coming to Sahaja Yoga. I don't say you give up your drugs, I don't say give up anything but you just do it yourself. Say you are having a snake in your hand and there is darkness, you can't see if you are obstinate, you will say no, it's not a snake, it's a rope. And somebody says it's a snake, till it bites you will go and say no, it's not a snake, it's a rope. But if there is little light you will throw it away yourself. It is like this. You yourself throw it away, I don't tell you anything. I don't say don't do this or anything. None of the Ten Commandments I tell you. But you just don't do it, you become, you become a righteous personality, become. Your attention becomes pure, your eyes become innocent. It's a very different personality that exposes itself. Your family life improves, you get beautiful children. May we have such beautiful all around the world, you should see them. I've never seen them fighting or quarrelling. Of course they pull each other's legs all right, lot of sense of humor, that's all. But such beautiful relationships. No wife runs away with somebody's husband and somebody's husband running out, none of these things. You become extremely pure, absolutely kali self-equality. So may God bless you. Let us have now the realization and also I hope now you will understand that you have to give some time to yourself. You have to respect yourself and you have to take to realization in such a way that you become great Sahaja Yogis. You know it's a big responsibility because this is a special time as I told you. At this time you are born to get your realization and now it is your responsibility to give realizations to others. Unless and until you mature yourself, how will you give? And for that you don't have to pay anything. Nothing has to be paid. It just says it works out. My request is that you should have a better name as Canadians, as seekers and I am sure it will work out. May God bless you. I'm happy to see some Chinese also here. I'm going to China this time. My way here I'm going to mainland China. There are some very nice Sahaja Yogis out there. I know you are president very well and that's how it's going to work out. But Chinese stick to their wives more than to Sahaja Yoga, is it true? You should bring your wives also to Sahaja Yoga, so it's all right. Makes no difference. I think these are all myths and they can be dropped. I'm your Mother and I want you all to be your own masters, your own gurus. You don't need any guru or anybody. Once you have the light you are the masters. These people who have no light, nothing and they have become such gurus while you become the gurus and still you are extremely humble about it. It's just like a laden tree with fruits, bends down. So it will take about, I think at the most ten to fifteen minutes. It's a very simple travel up at the most three to four feet and it works out very well. Only thing is that those who don't want to have it, I cannot force it because I respect your freedom and I cannot force it, this realization. I cannot. I respect your freedom completely. Those who don't want to have it should leave the hall, will be a good idea because otherwise it will not be very civil to other people who are trying to enter into the kingdom of God. So those who don't want to have should not be here to disturb others. This is My humble request. Now, the second thing is very simple, that there are three conditions for your self-realization, which are very simple actually. The first one is that you are not to feel guilty for anything at this moment. Let the Kundalini judge you, you don't judge yourself. So please don't feel guilty. According to Me, you are a human being, you are not God. And if you have made mistakes, it's all right to urge human and to forgive Divine. And this all-pervading power of Divine love is an ocean, it is an ocean of forgiveness and whatever mistakes you might have committed, it can be dissolved completely. So at this moment, please don't feel guilty. And do you know, if you feel guilty, what happens? The chakra on the left hand side here catches, goes into geocards sometimes and you might get spondylitis or you may get ear trouble or you may get angina or sometimes you get lethargic organs. It's a very serious thing. So why to have such a guilt? If you have done any mistake, face it up, finish it up. Don't put it forever here, I am guilty, I am guilty, I am guilty and punish yourself. That means in short, forget your past. That's first condition. The second one is to forgive everyone. Now you don't have to think about that because it's a headache. Now logically, whether you forgive or you don't forgive, you don't do anything. What do you do? Do nothing. But if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands and the person who has troubled you, tortured you, hurt you, is perfectly healthy. But you suffer, so please forgive. Forgive everyone without thinking about them. Just don't think about them. What they are, what they have done, finished. Just in general you forgive everyone. Immediately you'll feel better. It's such a headache to remember that you have not to forgive. Now the third condition should be really the first one. Is that you have to be absolutely confident, all of you, that you will get your realization tonight, absolutely have faith in yourself. If you have faith in yourself it will work out. All of you will get your realization tonight here with us. Just don't doubt yourself. That's all. I hope these conditions are not very difficult. All right. Now first we'll show you how we'll be nourishing our own centers. You will do it yourself but this is to be done only for tonight. You don't have to do it later on. Just for tonight. If you can take out your shoes it would be better because this Mother Earth helps us a lot to take away our problems. You have to be comfortable sitting in your chairs. Of course you should not slouch but be comfortable. You have to know one thing. That you don't have to go to Himalayas or to any such places. You will get them here only, not to stand on your head or anything of the kind. It's very simple. It just works out, very simple. All right. So now we have to understand that there are two sides. One is left, one is right side. There are two sides and the left side is for our power of desire and the right side is for power of action. So you please put your left hand on your lap just like this, very comfortably. Somebody should show, who is that? Like this. This indicates or symbolizes that you want to have your Self-realization. You have a desire to have your Self-realization. Just put your right side. Now, you have to use the right hand for nourishing our centers. So put your right hand on your heart. In the heart resides the Spirit. If you become the Spirit, you become your own master because in the light of Spirit you know the truth. So now please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side which is the center created by great prophets and saints for our mastery. Now take down this right hand, the lower portion of your abdomen and put your hand on the left hand and press it. Just come forward, I think people can't see. In the lower portion. Now surprisingly this is the center for pure divine knowledge. Pure divine knowledge is the center. You will know about it very well and how it works and how it acts through your central nervous system. So here it is the knowledge that you get on your finger tips which is on the central nervous system as you have to get it with your evolution. The knowledge of the divine laws, they start working through your being once you have your realization. That is called as bodh. In Sanskrit it's called bodh, means feeling on your central nervous system. Now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, then on your heart, then in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right. This is the center to your right, please turn it to your right. This center I've already told you goes into trouble when you feel guilty. Now please take your right hand on top of your forehead and put down your head across. This is the center is to forgive everyone in general. Put down your head. Now take this right hand on the back side of your head and push back your head as far as possible. This is the center for your satisfaction. Without counting mistakes, without feeling guilty, just for your satisfaction you have to ask forgiveness from the divine power. Now the last one is very important. Stretch your palm fully and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area which was the soft bone in your childhood. In Sanskrit called as talam, means talu. And now put down your head as far as possible. Here you have to move your scalp. So is important it is to stretch back your fingers. Stretch back your fingers and move your scalp slowly, clockwise, seven times. Stretch back your fingers. If you don't stretch back, put down your heads, put down your heads. And now stretch, stretch back your fingers, seven times. That's all we have to do. Very simple it is. Now as left and right are two powers, we have to put both the feet apart from each other. Not sitting on the ground people can sit comfortably, it's all right anyway, very good. Put the left hand now on your lap and you have to now put your right hand on your heart. You have to close your eyes now and not to open them till I tell you. At the heart center you have to ask a very fundamental question in your heart three times. You can call Me Mother or you can call Me Shri Mataji. Ask a question, Mother, am I the Spirit? Ask this three times. Mother, am I the Spirit? In your heart. I've already told you that if you become the Spirit, then in the light of the Spirit you become your guide, your master. So now please put your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Here you press it and here ask another fundamental question three times. Mother, am I my own master? Ask this question three times. Now please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Here is the center for pure divine knowledge. This has got six petals. I cannot force this knowledge on you. So you have to ask six times, Mother, please give me pure divine knowledge. You have to ask for it six times. Unless and until you ask for it, I cannot force it on you. As soon as you ask for pure divine knowledge, the Kundalini starts rising. Some people do feel, but it's better not to feel it. Those who have obstructions might feel a little rising or maybe little heat. Now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Here we have to use our full confidence to open these upper centers. Please say ten times, Mother, with full confidence, Mother, I am my own master. Say it with full confidence ten times. I've already told you that you are not this body, this mind, these conditionings and this ego, but you are the pure Spirit. So now please raise your right hand onto your heart and here you have to say with full confidence twelve times, Mother, I am the pure Spirit. Now, please forgive yourself. The All Pervading Power of Divine Love is the ocean of knowledge, ocean of bliss and ocean of joy, but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness. So whatever mistakes you have committed is easily resolved by this power of this ocean of forgiveness. So please forgive yourself and raise your hand up to the neck and the shoulder, of corner of the neck and the shoulder and turn your head to your right. This is the worst center you have now here. So please be careful. Please say sixteen times, Mother, I am not guilty at all. Please say sixteen times. As I explain to you whether you forgive or you don't forgive, you don't do anything, but if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands. Moreover this particular center is a very constricted center. If you do not forgive now it won't open and you'll miss the chance of your Self-realization. As it is you have tortured yourself by not forgiving and now you should not miss this great opportunity. So I request you again and again that please forgive in general by saying, Mother, I forgive everyone in general. Put your hand on top of your forehead across and put down your head and now here you have to say, Mother, I forgive everybody in general. Please put your hand on your forehead across. Now, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for yourself, you have to ask forgiveness from the All Pervading Divine Power. So please take your right hand back side of your head and push back your head. Push back fully. Here you have to say from your heart, not how many times, from your heart you have to say, Mother, or O Divine Power, please forgive me if I have done any mistake knowingly or unknowingly. O Divine Power, please forgive me if I have done any mistake knowingly or unknowingly. Please say it from your heart, not how many times. Now the last center is extremely important. You have to open your heart fully for it. You have to open your heart. Now, stretch your palm fully, take the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone in your childhood. Now push back your fingers and put down your head. Here. Put down your head. Here again, I cannot force Self-realization on you. You have to ask for it. So please now move your scalp seven times, clockwise, say it seven times, Mother, please give me my Self-realization. Please bend your heads and push back your fingers, that's it. Push back, away from the head, push it backwards. Pitch away, pitch away. Bend your heads. Close your eyes. Outward, seven times. Now please, please take down your hands, open your eyes. Put both the hands towards Me like that and watch Me without thinking. Just watch Me without thinking. Now put the right hand towards Me and put down your head and see with your left hand if there's a cool or a hot breeze like thing coming out of your own head. If you have not forgiven, then it would be hot breeze, but if you have forgiven, it would be cooler. Better to forgive now. Don't put it on top of your head, but away from it and see for yourself if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. You have to move it a little to see. Some people get it very far also. Put your right hand towards Me and see with the left hand, right hand. Now put your left hand towards Me and see with the right hand. Bend your head, bend your head and see for right hand there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head. Pay attention to your head. Now again with the right hand the last time, you put down your head again nicely and see for yourself and ascertain if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head. All right. Now please put both your hands towards the sky like that and ask one of these questions three times. Close your eyes, push back your head and ask one of these questions three times. Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? Or Mother, is this the all pervading power of Divine Love that is Ruh? Or Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya? Ask anyone of these questions three times. Now put down your hands. Put your hands like this. Feel it on your hands also. Feel very relaxed. All those who have felt cool or hot breeze out of their fontanel bone area or on their fingertips or on their palms, please raise both your hands. Oh, one. Practically everyone. May God bless you. I hope you will grow now and respect your Self-realization. You have to give little time, you have to come, so many of you. Some very few didn't get it. Maybe you are doubting or I don't know what you are doing with your mind, but must be something which can be corrected. So may God bless you. If you have gone to some wrong guru also sometimes you don't get your realization. I'm very happy. Now you can feel each other's head, you can feel it. You can feel others also. This is the All Pervading Power which I'm talking first time you are feeling. First time you felt it. But now you might feel very much better, sometimes people feel they are on the seventh avenue and all that. It's true. But you must know how to fix your connection is important. It's very important and for that we have a center here, you can tell them and also can give them. You must come to the center, please. Now we have so many people. If you all take to Sahaja Yoga the whole of Vancouver you can change, you can. But please, I will not ask for a promise, but as a mother I request you that please look after your Self-realization. It's very important. You've got something so precious because they should not pay it for you because you think it's just free because it is vital. It is something you cannot pay for. It's too precious. I try to respect it. Thank you very much. May God bless you. I'll be here definitely after one year. I always come after a year, I don't know. So I would like to meet those people from Russia tomorrow. Yes, Shri Mataji. I used to meet all of them, there are so many people. I should take one girl to the United States. It's all right. Thank you. Some people who have not felt you can call them in. Anyone who hasn't, who didn't feel the cool breeze, if you could come over to this side of the stage, we'll have some sahaja yogis come over here and help those people to try and get to feel the cool breeze. So anyone who didn't feel it who would like to feel the experience, please come over to this side of the stage, right hand side. We have some sahaja yogis come over here please too. We'd also like to announce that every Thursday at 7 p.m. we have a meeting at the Kensington Community Centre and every Tuesday at the North Shore Neighbourhood House and we encourage everyone to take one of these, they help the number of all the centres in the Vancouver area. And they also have a little thing if you'd like to leave your name and address on there, we'll contact you and let you know when we're having our follow-up meetings for sahaja yoga. And if you have any questions you could feel free to call us at any time. Also on Wednesday October the 20th we'll be having a meeting at SFU at the Harbour Centre for all the people who live in the downtown area. So I believe these are at the front so if people would like to take one of these. The first follow-up meeting will be in Kensington on October the 14th at 7 p.m. and the second one is on Friday October the 15th at 7 in Richmond and the third one is on Wednesday October the 20th at SFU.

This is all everything! Nothing matters! You can go now. I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the very outset I have to say that truth is what it is. You cannot describe it. You cannot change it. You cannot proclaim it. You have to experience it. If you do not have the experience of truth, no use doing any meditation, any all kinds of nonsense that's going on all over the world. It's very important because I call this as the blossom time. Is the time where the last judgment has to happen. And in this last judgment you are going to decide whether you want the truth or untruth. So I would request you also not to believe Me blindfolded. We have had lots of problems from blind faith. But whatever I am telling you if it proves then as honest people you better accept. Because it's for your benevolence. Benevolence of your family and benevolence of the whole world. Coming to the point what is the truth. In modern times there are so many seekers of truth. But they don't know what they are seeking. They are seeking and seeking and they are branded as seekers. But what are you seeking? What you are seeking is your evolution. Not just talking, not doing some course but you are seeking your higher being that you are not this body, this mind, this ego, these conditionings, emotions but you are the pure spirit. And you are seeking that. And as a result until you become the spirit you will go on seeking. Blindly going to this place, to that place, becoming bankrupt sometimes. One must understand for our evolution we have not paid anything. We have achieved this human awareness without doing any effort. You don't have to stand on your heads. You don't have to take sannyas and nothing of the kind. It's not outside. The evolution is within and takes place. I'm already told that you know everything about this Kundalini business. This Kundalini is your Mother. She is your individual Mother. She knows everything about you. She knows what has been your past and what are your aspirations. She knows everything but we must also ask Her to rise, Her to be awakened and it will work. I'm sure it will work. The centers about which you have been told are responsible for our physical, mental and emotional being. It's a very old thing that people knew about it. I was surprised I went to Kiev in Ukraine. I went to see the museum and they had all the paintings of Kundalini there, of all the centers. I was amazed and that too on terracotta they had done it. They had made this terracotta not with any wheel, with machine but just with the hand. I don't know how they did it. And they had all the pictures there. I went to Colombia, Bolivia and there too they knew everything about Kundalini, right side, left side, central side, everything. And they said we knew all this but we didn't know how to awaken. Imagine! So this knowledge is not only from India. It was spread all over the world. All those who were saints all over the world knew about it. In the Bible also is written that, I will appear before you as tongues of flames. These chakras really look like that, living flames, very beautiful colors. But all this inner knowledge, though everybody knew, got lost because people at the helm of affairs started diverting the attention of people from spirit to other things. So we find all religions are nothing but money oriented or they are power oriented. They are fighting for lands, not for peace, not for this spirit that is within. And when we talk of peace, want to have peace, we are not at peace with ourselves. How can we have peace? Those who have no peace within themselves, how can they give peace? The peace is within us and a person will achieve that state of peace and joy. That person doesn't ask for anything to be achieved. It is already achieved. We are jumped in the sea, ocean of joy. So many things can happen and I've told you that these centers are responsible for physical, mental and emotional being. I've seen people becoming poets overnight, becoming musicians, becoming artists, becoming orators, writing books. It's surprising how their potential is expressed. You must have heard about England having lots of problems with unemployment, but not one single Sahaja Yogi is without a job, because attention becomes so much enlightened. Attention as described by Christ, it becomes pure and innocent. He was so subtle to say, thou shalt not have adulterous eyes. That means in the eyes there should be no lust and greed. It's not possible you cannot take out your eye, wash it and put it back. The problem is within. But when this Kundalini rises, there's a spark in your eyes, sparkling eyes and this innocent glance is so powerful. Because it's full of compassion, pure love, such a person can put attention to anyone, anywhere in the world and this attention acts, this works. All these powers are within you that you have not achieved. You have never known, but it's there and you should experience your own powers and see for yourself how you can help yourself and how you can help others. Because the second thing that happens to you, that you become connected with the All-Pervading Power of Divine Love. As a result you get connected to everyone because you develop a new dimension in your awareness which is known as collective consciousness. Yogi has described it, he has talked about it, he went up to a point. But you all can have it, you all can get it. You're all absolutely worthy of it. It's your own power that is going to give you this. You're not obliged to Me or obliged to anyone, but obliged to your own Mother Kundalini who does this job. She's so anxious to give you your second one. And you can't pay. This is what people don't understand. You see here, see beautiful flowers. You see there, we don't know that it's a miracle to have these different flowers so beautifully created by this Mother Earth. How does she do it? We never even think about it. It's a miracle. And miracle is done by this All-Pervading Power of Divine Love. This Divine Love flows through you by which so many things you can do. First of all you feel for the first time the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, the cool breeze of the Paramachaitanya, first time. Well you have to accept. You have not to doubt that once you get it. And then you should know how to use it, how to use this power. After all you see the whole world is full of chaos, full of confusion and full of nonsense. You are the ones who can help. You are the ones who can emit this power to others and you can solve the problem. Not only you are seeking it for yourself but for everyone who wants to have it. Of course you can't force it. You cannot be forced. It is spontaneous no doubt but you cannot force on a person who doesn't want to have it. It's very simple but one must know that behind the simplicity there's a very big organization that is working it out. See all these lights here. It's very easy just to put on these lights with one switch but there's a big organization, big potential energy that is working it out. In the same way there is a very big power. You have to feel it without and within and to understand it. This attention when it becomes so pure and so innocent people are surprised. Most of them used to think that they have lost their innocence. You cannot lose it. It's an eternal thing. Some clouds may be there but they just disappear and innocence shines. I have seen people from sixty-five countries arrive in India. I have never seen them quarrelling, fighting, arguing. Of course they pull each other's legs quite a lot, that's different and have lot of fun. But life becomes a fun, just fun and understanding that you are in the kingdom of God. You are no more in trouble. Physically you are cured. Of course most of the diseases can be cured by you yourself. Mentally you are at peace with yourself. All these modern diseases of stress and strain and all that just disappear. Because Kundalini pierces through your fontanel bone area and She makes connection with this all-pervading power, everything gets dissolved into that and all the time you find you are helped. All the time miracles happen one after another and you are surprised. I don't want to describe them here today. You for yourself you should see what are these miracles and what is happening and how you are helped in life. You are not alone because now you are in the collective. You are a part and parcel of the whole. You are not alone and we are all in different countries, we are all brothers and sisters. We are all together, all relations, so close that something happens to one person the whole world knows about it. So the loneliness of life finishes and you enjoy the company of others. Never get bored, never get bored because you enjoy yourself. The light of the Spirit has to come. That is very important because without the light we are blind and we follow all kinds of things. They were telling Me now new type of tantric some nonsense has started in Canada. Now try to understand that this is another Rajneesh nonsense. As you must have seen now here, this point I want to stress, you see this red center is the center that we call as the Mooladhara chakra. This center is the one which looks after, you can say, even the sex and is below the Kundalini. You just see that. It is below the Kundalini. So when the Kundalini rises you become like a child. So this nonsense of this kind of a yoga is absolutely absurd. Christ has said you have to become like children when you have to enter into the kingdom of God. Now don't try to get another Rajneesh prosper in Canada. People told Me that now Canadians are taking to this stupid thing again. One after the another they are coming. I am warning you as a Mother. The other day one fellow had come, I don't know where he is now today, last time, and he told Me he's lost all his money, everything. I said, where? He said, I gave it to Dalai Lama. For what? Dalai Lama is just buying gold from everywhere. Don't you know that? But he said, Mother, my everything is lost within. What has happened to us, what has happened to our intelligence? Why not we think that a person who is taking money to buy gold, what has he got to do with God, with Christ, with Shri Krishna? Because we are used to it. We think we must pay, we must pay not for this. And in America when I came first time, in Boston they asked Me how many Rolls Royces I had. I said, I have none. My husband has only one car, that's all. So you are not in the business? I said, no, not at all. They said, we are not interested in you. Just imagine. If with that mentality if you go towards God, towards Spirit, you'll never get it. You cannot pay for it. This is very important. And once you decide that, half of them will run away. They have come here to lynch you. The Sanadhabara who teaches you how to move the pendulum. I never knew such a person existed. But in Washington they all came, said, Mother, we sold our houses, taken out our children from school and all that, whatever, what happened? A gentleman told them that you can control the mind of other persons. So he called somebody, made him stand on the stage, gave him a pendulum and he said, now, see, he will move the pendulum. And the pendulum started moving. So we believed in him. We wanted to control the mind of others. I said, all right. But have you come on this earth to move pendulums? What is the value of your life? Have you evaluated why are you a human being on this earth at this time? How could you waste your energy on moving a pendulum? You are seekers of truth. I'm not just trying to praise you but you have to be glorified and not to be made stupid fools, taking away all your money. How can that be? A simple thing should be understood, that materialism has nothing to do with spirituality. But spirituality has something to do with materialism. When you become spiritual, you'll be amazed, your problems will be solved. How? Because your attention is all right. Because of your beautiful attention you can do wonders. The brain which is only used, I don't know how much part a human being uses the brain, becomes enlightened and you become an enlightened intelligent man. Now your intelligence cannot cheat you. Moreover this mind is what is nothing but your own creation through your conditionings and your ego you have created this mind. Most unreliable thing is your own mind. You have to go beyond that mind. And Kundalini takes you there where this mind is no more, you are in thoughtless awareness. When that happens you see the whole thing like a witness. Just like a witness, it's a drama. Whole thing is a big drama. But you can help. You are sitting in a drama for example and you see something, you start even weeping and cry with the whole thing thinking that you are being harassed and you have been troubled. When the drama is over you are surprised, it's just a drama in the same way. It happens to us that we find all this nonsense as a drama. But we cannot help the actor on the stage. Here we can. Here our attention can help everyone whom you want to help. And in such a beautiful manner it doesn't harm you, it doesn't harm anybody. On the contrary it just elevates a person to a very noble and to a very dignified personality. Our ideas, whatever we have formed from books here and there, get completely in order and we understand what is the truth and what is not the truth. Now do you know truth is love and love is truth? Supposing you love somebody, you know everything about that person. For people who are intelligent they think truth is separated. No, no. Absolutely one. Compassion is truth and truth is compassion. But the compassion that you get is the one that flows to others. All selfishness, all jealousies and all these petty nonsensical things just drop out. And nobody can trouble you also because you are protected. You are protected by your goodness. There's no end to it as Jeffrey has already told you everything. He's told Me I need not say anything to you. And of course I know people have some questions in their mind and I would like to know the questions that you have. You may write to Me and I'm sure I'll be able to answer. If not Me somebody else will answer for me. But it is a very simple thing. It's not a mental acrobat or it's not some sort of a question and answer this and that. It's something of getting which you deserve, which you have to have, is your right. Every seeker has this right. Sahaja means, saha means with, jo is born. Many saints in our country have talked about it. Guru Nanaka has said it, sahaja samadhi raga. You get your enlightenment sahaja. Everyone has said that but I don't know why people take to something very hazardous and difficult. And this saha means with, jo is born with you, is the right to get your Self-realization. These are special times. I call them blossom time but also very difficult. You cannot stop people from being cruel, immoral, absolutely ridiculous. You cannot stop. But when it happens you see the beauty. Just like lotuses come out of ponds like that I have seen people so fragrant and so beautiful. But ultimately I would say above all you jump in the ocean of joy. And joy is singular. It's not like happiness, unhappiness but joy is singular. You enjoy everything. Everything that you see you enjoy. And enjoyment is such that you cannot describe, it is to be experienced. I hope next time when I come you all will become great saints and great trees of Sahaja Yoga, giving realizations to many. That's what you have to do. You have to do it not only in Canada but all over. Now we had to get people from America and also from England, India. I wish some Canadians could go abroad to do this great work and enjoy themselves. Thank you very much. May God bless you. It will take hardly ten minutes for you, only hardly ten minutes. I have to again tell you that I cannot force it on you. If you don't want to have it, it's perfectly all right. It cannot be forced. But if you stay here when others are having it, you might disturb others. So best thing is I would request you to leave the hall if you don't want to have your realization. There's no problem, nothing happens to you. All these descriptions you have read about Kundalini, that it burns you and there's all nonsense, I've never seen it happening. So please believe in yourself. Have faith in yourself. Just be pleasantly placed towards yourself, firstly. I find some of you are still little unhappy or maybe you're thinking of something that was not very kind to you, doesn't matter. Now the first thing is that you have to be very pleasantly placed upon yourself. Means you should have no guilt, no confessions, no guilt, nothing. At this moment you should know they are not guilty at all. Please know that. This is a fashion also, people are guilty for anything. I know of a gentleman who spilled some coffee sometimes and he's still feeling guilty about it. I said, must be funny. Whatever has happened, has happened in the past, we are talking about the present, you have to be in the present and for that please first of all forgive yourself. Just forgive yourself. That's very important. And the second one is that you must forgive everyone. Now many say it's very difficult to forgive, very difficult. But what do you do if you don't forgive? What do you do? Nothing, it's just mental. Nothing you do. Actually if you don't forgive then you torture yourself for nothing at all and you play into wrong hands. So best thing is to forgive. Forgive everyone. Don't even think about those who have troubled you because that's another headache. Just say in your hearts, I forgive everyone in general. Finished. Now these two are not very difficult conditions, I hope so. And you realize that by this there's an obstruction. If the left Vishuddhi, this portion here, can you show them? This one gets into jeopardy. If you feel guilty, this one, then minimum you'll get is spondylitis, minimum. You might get angina. Also you'll get lethargic organs because of this one center on the left hand side due to your so-called guilt will be there. So why feel guilt? Then the chakra here is the center of the optic chiasma is, you see like this, absolutely like this, like a cross. And it won't open unless and until you forgive others. It won't open, it's very constricted. So when you forgive others it opens and that's how the Kundalini is going to pass. At this moment is very important in your life. You'll realize you must allow this Kundalini to pass through your Agnya and then pierce through your fontanel bone area which is a baptism, actualization of baptism. It's not some priest coming and putting water on your head but actually it happens. So whatever I have said also I've told you that has physical problems. So better just listen to Me and don't be miserable. You know in France I went and they told Me, Mother, people are very miserable here. They are not going to believe You because You are such a happy person. I said, why? Why are they miserable? They are very miserable because I told them very good reason in Paris what I find, every third or fourth lamppost, you see, there's a prostitute standing, every tenth lamppost what you find is a pub where people are just coming out like that, falling on the street and others are going inside to pay and again come back and fall on the street. So it's going to be like that. They will be miserable no doubt, I mean they want misery. When they see somebody falling on the street, why go inside? But they do. So you see they look very miserable. So the first time I spoke there, you must have read the book, Les Miserables, so I addressed them, Les Miserables. You see it's a fashion to say how miserable I am, make everyone miserable saying that I am very miserable. You are not. You are the pure Spirit. The Spirit is the source of joy and bliss. How can you be miserable? And it works. It works very well. Even Mohammed Sahab had talked about it very clearly that unless and until you know yourself you cannot know Allah, you cannot know God. Everybody has said the same thing. I don't know what they are doing. I don't know what they are up to. Let us now enter into the reality. You must know the reality. And then when our eyes are open we can see. Kabir Das has said, how can I explain they are all blind? Kese samajah hu, samajah gandha. Now let's open our eyes and become joyful, blissful people. God has not forgotten us. We have forgotten. He's not forgotten. As I said it will take ten minutes and I hope nobody will get up and walk during that time. At the most ten minutes. Now the Sahaja Yoga has taken a speed and works much faster than before. I would request you to put both your hands towards Me like this, just like this. But you have to take out your shoes. If possible take out your shoes. And better to take out also glasses. Just to put both the hands like this. Just like this. Simple. Now as you know that these are all finger tips which are the seven centers on the right hand side, seven centers on the left hand side of the sympathetic nervous system, endings of the sympathetic nervous system. And when you are putting your hands like this they are getting a cool breeze. They are getting the divine power flowing into it. Now you can put down your head a little, put the left hand towards Me and put the right hand on top of your head on the fontanel bone area. But bend your head is very important. Now see for yourself with the right hand on top of your head away from it. Some people get it very close to the head and some much above, but don't put your hand on top of the head, above, and move your hand and see for yourself if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. It's a breeze like vibrations. Please bend your head. Now please put your right hand towards Me like this and again put down your head and see with the left hand if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood. Please see for yourself. Now if it is hot means you have not forgiven yourself nor you have forgiven others, one of the things. So please do that. Please forgive yourself and forgive others and now see which will cool down. Now once more. Please put again the left hand towards Me and put down your head and see for yourself with the right hand if there is a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head. Now I hope you have forgiven yourself or forgiven others and it is cooler. Now please put both your hands towards the sky like this and push back your head. Here you have to ask one of the three questions, only one, three times. The first question you have to ask. You can call Me Mother or you can call Me Shri Mataji, whatever you feel like. Mother first question is, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? Second question is, Mother is this the All Pervading Power of Divine Love? The third question is Mother is this the Param Chaitanya, Alakhni Ranjan as they call it. Now ask any one of these questions three times. Now put down your hands. Please put down your hands. Now put both the hands towards Me again and watch Me if possible without thinking. Please put both the feet apart from each other, is important. Those who are sitting on the ground are alright for others. You can put on your glasses and you can watch without thinking. Now all those who have felt cool or hot breeze on the finger tips or in the palm or out of the fontanel bone area, please raise both your hands, both the hands. All those who have felt, may God bless you. Bye. Please. Thank you very much. You all have got it. Some haven't got, maybe, maybe something wrong which we'll see about it, what has happened. Very few haven't got it and they should come to our centers where you don't have to pay again I must say. Come to our center and if there's any problem they'll solve for you. But one thing you must know it. You must become a master of it. Anybody, women, men, anybody can become master and can do such a lot of work. It's a very much necessary today that we should all not only achieve ourself this higher life and noble life, but we should ourselves give it to others, very important. And we have to spread it. We have to spread it. Canada is one of the countries where I find is people are less than normal. America is the least. They are still having some sort of, I don't know what, another moving of the pendulum I think. But I find you people are much wiser so you take to it and find out more like you and give it to them. You'll really enjoy yourself no doubt, really enjoy yourself. So My message is that enjoy yourself, enjoy, may God bless you. Agana chaat kaalu, they may like to sing one song, I don't know, some bhajan, so you can clap and it will help. Now you'll be amazed that these are also Canadian people and some English, of course there are some Indians also, but imagine they are singing Sanskrit songs and how can they sing these Indian songs? It's very difficult with proper pronunciation. I never taught them anything. I don't know how they have done it, I can't understand. I'm told you gave very good songs. Next time I must also hear. Come forward. Come forward. Come forward.

Because natural things that are expected to be done are the assets. But on the original way, Shri Mataji, it's quite surprising that they are after Sahaja Yoga, which is actually numerically spoken, a small number, but they are not again this huge organisation of also sex, within themselves, they are very much afraid of you, Shri Mataji. They are very much afraid of you. Otherwise it's not logical that a huge organisation in the Catholic Church would become so much dynamic against them. Right. And who is the happy man? The combination of the happy man and the happy man. This is also the behaviour of the person. It was said that, that is the sort of secret of the behaviour. The behaviour is to look there. It is said that, it is said that the Catholic Church will be the one who is the most happy person in the world. This is the behaviour of the person. What is the name of the person? I hope that it is the man. This is the involved person. The involved person, okay? Do they no longer recognize what inclusive is of the gentlemen of Sahaja Yoga? Do they do not recognize how the Chino people are actually happier family members or not? The voice of permission to be done. This is the main chattel now that you have got. And also the distinction of Catholic to a supporting party minister. You could say that this is about a bull. Bull? Bull means a god, a branch. It becomes a thing. radioAUDIO The bull is a and there are seven days before. Because that guy who gave who got this is to be part to others or he is someone that was a part to others. The account they give is to those ones now a personal account. People give a lot of give and no deposit due to theANE to know because there SIN and heavy bl Wu and I am sure that you will be able to do that in the future. But in the past actually, any kind you could be even you could say it was official. Alright, even then I can do that. I think you could have punished somebody with a wife. So, you can say a fight, but you don't need to talk. That's alright. But how can you take this path to that? Yes, it's a blessing. It's a blessing. Yes? You see, we stopped at this small island before, then we moved to Bogota. The route that made it go along when we came to America first, came to this place, it's called Longan. It's called Spain. When we discovered America, we came to San Domingo and then it came down. It says it came down South America. But it started in that place where the port came and where you came. No, it came to Central America but more in the South. Very good fact. Because you said it's not cancer. It's global. No, no. It's so far. What is the difference between the two? You can call both the papa and what you call your father. Very strange to know. Papa is here with you. Papa is important in the beginning. What is the difference between the two? Papa and papa. Papa is the pope and papa is the father. What is the difference between the two? Papa is the father and the father is the father. What is the difference between the two? Papa and papa. It's very difficult to know what the father is and what he is. What is the difference between the two? Papa and papa. Papa is the father and the father is the father. What is the difference between the two? Papa and papa. If this is the only way, because we are not seeing, our lives are all seen. It's hard to see. But that's the difference. What we did for many years is so wrong. What's the difference? What's the difference? I think the biggest trick of this Catholic Church is that it's just like giving you a visit card. You are doing all the things of the world, but here's the visit card that goes from the Catholic Church manual of the people. So when it is necessary to give it as a visit card, they need it somehow, to justify that they need it. But they are not anyway following the Catholic Church somehow. What's the difference between the two? Papa and papa. What's the difference? What's the difference? Papa and papa. What's the difference? Papa and papa. What's the difference? Papa and papa. What's the difference? What's the difference? What's the difference? What's the difference? What's the difference? What's the difference? What's the difference? What's the difference? What's the difference? What's the difference? What's the difference? What's the difference?

I'd better write down the chart. Yes, ma'am. The chart. But I am told it's very time-consuming. But not about the loca, shmaya. I've never heard about the loca. In the vedas. It's luisvita of vedas. Do you also feel that? You can reach out something in the name. Manana, jana, tarpa, tarpa. Do you also find it difficult to derive from there a computer that's taken it from you? It's difficult to derive from the computer in India. But true. That India's country was starting again. Is it true, Bob, that you are saying, when you are thinking about the country, You are saying that India is starting again? But I think that it's difficult to derive from the country. Yes, ma'am. When you are thinking about the country, what is the difference between India and India? The question is, where are you sitting now? When Navasya Puja starts at 6 o'clock, exactly, very soft. What time? During Navasya Puja. Because the Puja starts at 10. So first we put our hands. So I tell you. Let me see the panchayat. Panchayat is the one where the time is used to go. The good time, the bad time. Thank you. What time is it? It's exactly 6 o'clock, very soft. In the Puja, I would like to ask you to tell us, how do you call it in English? Pancha. Pancha is a language that is used to speak to all the people who are in the country. The time is used to speak to all the people. In the Puja, you can speak to all the people. Everything is used to speak to all the people. Everything is used to speak to all the people. So exactly, it's the same as in the Puja. How do you say it in English? I think it's the same as in the Puja. Actually, there are two different patterns. One by one, you call it Bishramani. Bishramani. And this was visited by my forefather, Shalivani. So we have one Shalivani and one Bishramani. Bishramani. Bishramani. So what is Bishramani? Bishramani is Shalivani. So you are speaking in English. One of the Bishram is also from Shalivani. Shalivani is also a person of the same age. So the first word is Shalivani. And Maharaja means Shalivani. And the second word is Maharaja. I mean for... I mean for... ...time. Whether it's dark or dark. It depends on the mood and the stars. Not on the sun and the moon. It depends on the sun. But it depends on the moon. It depends on the sun and the moon. It depends on the sun. But the sun is more than the moon. Do you recognize that somehow the whole of the Bishram is gone? Whether or not I have found it. But that day, now I am seeing... I just was reading something wrong. Why did not I stop? So then I just translated the book and it was all gone. But here today, when we have discovered that we have been born, we have to find out what is going on. But we can't find out. And I have discovered that we have just finished discovering that we can't go back. But why do you do such a thing? I think that in Bishram is a convenience. In Bishram, it is so easy that all the things that are going on are a convenience. But that's not exactly a good thing. So we have to find out what is going on. We have to find out what is going on. Because we can only come back again. This is because we can only come back again. It doesn't matter. I think that I can. I can't go back very much because everything is gone. I am not going to do anything. So I can't go back to the place. You are right. What do you mean? I don't know. I think that I have found the truth. There are so many miracles. There are so many miracles that I can't see. I think that there are so many miracles. So many miracles. And after I found the place, we found a beautiful place. A place where there are so many miracles that I can't see. When I first started doing it, I was wondering what is going on. I was wondering what is going on. I was wondering what is going on. I was wondering what is going on. I come to this moment of films. weaponize! But here, there is a night when the service came to my facility. I was wondering. Let's go back to the switch. Absolutely very good. It was the best that we had in India. Absolutely the best. Ah, absolutely. Mr. Pudha was the truth. The truth. The truth. A different vibe in Shmueli. Relaxed probably. Relaxed. Also the last finger. This finger, one of the last finger. The inner finger. Relaxed. Is it concur? Yeah, concur. I mean all of them, Shmueli, all of them. Just the explanation. It's just sand. Salt. Mm, that's all. It's just sand that you can use. Yeah, all of them are concurred. The last finger is also the last finger. The last finger is the last finger. This is the last finger. This is the last finger. The last finger is the last finger. This is the last finger. I see as a haunt just like everyone else, there is no way they would look at you or look where you are, no matter where you live in India. When you are at home especially, the song Bart g struggles a lot of times Yeah. When you are playing the drums. I'm preparing a musical that we don't know in Mumbai. How do you say it? It's all for recognition. It's all for recognition. It's all for recognition. It's all for recognition. It's all for recognition. Yes, of course. I understand that the name, the name of the person who used to say it... He said it in his own words. And also in his own words, in his own words. Yes. Edgy. No. No. It's a picture of Edgardo, actually. Edgy. Edgy. He's the one. He's coming a very long list from Brasilia. He's coming a long list from Brasilia. Yes. I have here the points, Mr. T. I have here the points for the people that... Yes, I brought them with me. I brought them with me. They are all models of Argentina. But I think that it's not just about the people. People who are in the same place, who are in the same place, who are in the same place, who are in the same place. I want to see what they are. You are not going to see it. I don't want to see it. But what sort of... What sort of jobs people can get here? In Portugal? In Brazil? Yes. I am... I am in the I am in the Yes, try to teach this profession. Try every profession. You should tell me what sort of people can get here. In fact. It's quite difficult, not at all. It's quite difficult to say, Shree Mataji. We will check, Shree Mataji. But considering Rio, I find so much building is going on. Yes. Actually, in Salvador, we are constructing much more than Rio. Really? Yes, Salvador. We are constructing much more than Rio. But you told me that they don't have a chance. Yes, because now the construction of the old building is just really well done. It's not very good. Yes. So, it's a man who can marry him. Or the lady who marry outside. Yes, that would be the best solution. But in this way, the thing will never grow. Just squatting and squatting and squatting all day long. You are coming to squat too much. And both women? Yes, both women. So, to work here, you have to know what work you can do here in Brazil. Because if you have a Brazilian family, a local family, you have to know what you can do here. So, the idea is that if you have a Brazilian family, you have to know that you can do it. And if you have a Brazilian family, you have to know what you can do here. That's what I'm saying. Because if you have a Brazilian family, you have to know what you can do. Yes, exactly. You have to know what you can do. Yes, especially for foreign people. For foreign people, in this area, translation school in Brazil, we can check it, because Brazil is a city that works with a lot of languages. So, we can have something there. It's a novelty, possibly Diana. Yes, it's a novelty. In Colombia, you have to go there. I'm here in Colombia, in Buenos Aires, and we are in Giro, and we have to go to the beach. Yes. In the city, you have to go there. I don't know what you can do. Yes, you can get some job. You are pretty easy now to get. It depends on the qualification. If you have qualifications, you get jobs. In the other side? Yes, I did. But there should be, there should be some Europe. Yes, right. Not from here. More from, yes, but you should know the Dantros. You should know the language. Yes. How do you say Spanish? No, it's not so much. It's easy. I'm not saying that we are not going to be able to speak English. No, we are not. We are not. Sugar, maybe. I'm not saying that Portuguese is difficult. I'm not saying that Portuguese is difficult. That's a joke. Many Italians, madam, I mean, I don't know the language. I want French men, French people to know the language. French. French, figures. French, figures. French. But I think it's a lie. I think that Paul is thinking that if you think that you need to learn to speak English, what is the reason for this? Don't you think? Yes, it's true, it's very nice. But you are not French. See those folks who are not French, they know this. French itself is a very difficult language. Yes. Because it writes separately, very properly. It's very efficient for the throat. Yes, I'm letting them down. France is the Red France Wall. Right, France is the Red France Wall. I mean, there is no connection. Yes, there is no connection. Indian seller, I must never do. All Indian girls have to go to the express in French. I think that there is no Indian in the space in France. All the girls are in France, they can go to the US. Indian seller. Everyone in Switzerland, One of the two cases is quite special in Switzerland, who have not learned French. Yes, I mean, just now come through. Those who have been there, have been in Germany. You mean that Pembali fellow? Oh yes, yes, of course. He does not know one word of French. Very sweet, similarly. You see, these are another style, like English. They will never learn any language. Very proud of their new language. I love it. Just remember, a case of an Indian, of an Indian saggioni, who went to Milano, and he went to the saggioni. He wanted to go to Torino, but he missed. He went to the street called Torino, instead of Milano. He did not understand, so he took him to the station, took him on the train to Torino, and took him to Torino. He was in the car, he was in Torino, he was speaking just a word with Kayla. He was there. So that didn't make sense? Yes, it was there. He was completely lost in Torino, he wanted to go in the street called Torino instead of Milano. So he arrived there. I don't know what happened after, but it was terrible for him. He didn't speak a word of it. He didn't speak even English much, he didn't speak even English. He spoke Japanese of the... He was just sitting in Marathi or Indian. Who was that? Oh, I don't know much, but he told me the story. Everybody was on the streets of g senseless. We went to him and... We went to Milano, and go ... And on the street somewhere we got an invitation to visit this teen calledss jackets. And once I saw that there had been a noise, a white wrestler playing and qaur installing a littleacking and in the western side, they were yelling at him. in the north language. Also Krijaya is the name of the language. So they've got from India. I said I am asking from India. He said, Krijaya please follow me. So always with languages there are problems. Krijaya is the name of the goddess also. She is the one born on the Giri and I make such mistakes. One thought that we were in a pronunciation of the other. Good fact. He came and told me the soul has come. One of the souls. I got the soul fish. I said how can you get soul fish in India? I said, really? Why let it come? He said, I want soul fish. I said, I want soul fish. He came and told me the soul has come. I said, I want soul fish. I said, I want soul fish. He said, why? He said, I want soul fish. I said, all right, all right. I call him. And this my daughter and my granddaughter sat on the floor. About ten minutes I think of what he was saying. This is my problem. The slightest pronunciation. The human laughs at me. I feel kind of desperate. Very too well. Because you are very angry so I thought I might get hurt. Shri Mataji, I think it's Mataji. I'm not talking to you around. I think you are all right. Very weak Shri Mataji. Shri Mataji, I think you are all right. I think you are all right. Shri Mataji, about understanding the world and so on, I was with three guys in Jigwa when he told me what he was in Nepal. They were telling me at the beginning, from the food source he had to sit in the water. So the Indians used to tell to him, you have to sit in the water. And for months and months and months, Shri Mataji, he would sit in the water. And then he, that is a little bit uneasy. So then there was a sign that he didn't tell him, that actually it was only the beef he put into the water. He said, eat the water. That's the mistake. Very interesting Shri Mataji. I was in Nepal and one of his books giving different subjects on which he was going to speak. I think in the morning he let up, he was showing his hand. He said, I'm going to show you the thing. Beef is very nice. I didn't know what he was doing. Every morning I would see him, take off his shoes and go out. I think everybody would understand that he would walk in without shoes and go out. The shoe would be sad. I had forgotten about this thing that they have to wear their shoes. Then I discovered that it was true that he was going to speak early in the morning. First thing. In Nepal also, Rajesh had forgotten about it. At that time I had known Rajesh that I was going to Nepal by such and such train and all that. Rajesh had completely forgotten when I was there. So he bought the ticket to go to Nepal and imagined we were on the same train. Alright, yes. I saw Rajesh that I was living in India. He was a world leader. We have four leaders in the world. I have one of them Rajesh and another one of them. I have many friends. I saw Rajesh that many of us were there. We were there for a long time. When we were there, he was speaking. He was not able to speak. At that time, you see, Mira Gandhi was the one who was very tyrannical. It was his father who went to another party. So she tried to return the milk in a palm place. She had nothing. She was terrible. He was in jail. He did? No. He did all kinds of things. So many others. Who was it? Mira Gandhi. She was a giver. She was there. She made it an emergency. She did all these things. Who was it? His father. Rajesh's father was pretty real. By? By the... Saying that he was in a palm place. So he was very much worried. He came with me in the plane and I told him that I just told money that there's going to be costly changes and there's going to be a change and this code is going to do the same, etc. And then it so happened Rajesh should not believe in such a... Why did she have an addiction? Because she knows she will lose if she has an addiction. Why is she having an addiction? I said she may have an addiction. She has a lot of emotions. She has a lot of emotions but Rajesh is very much worried. She has a lot of emotions. She is very worried about her emotions. Then in Nepal one day he told me he left that he went to my temple. It was my own temple. And I was standing with him and also it was my temple. That was my extension. Who dealt? And he could not understand how it would be that there was a lot of glee and he was put on the way to that's me on that everything and I was standing with him. So on Friday he went to this temple of Shiva. The abdominal part of the belly was users at first, but the angles of the tongue are always quite hard to see and after the blood flow she disappeared she was very seriously given and she stood through that window also so she could not understand. So, he saw and he put it out, you see. They were putting all the me and everything on that. And then he said, Mother, there are no vibrations coming from this. So, why is it? He said, I was really excited. And in the last time, I have to explain to you, Mother, I told you Mother, I put one hand towards Me, throw one hand towards the statue. So, I just said, Mother, you are Shri Mataji. And immediately, Mother, I put one hand towards You. And I said, Mother, I put one hand towards You. I didn't say that you were Shri Mataji, but you are Shri Shiva. And immediately, Mother, she starts to come to Shri Mataji. At that moment, the person who has been here, they are the start of Shri Shiva. Then he said, now I know what God has given you. That was Shiva's temple and you were standing with Me and She was your children. Just immediately, it's a very intelligent one. He was always telling Me, how we are the first shrimatas to come to the state, and when they are shrimatas, because Shiva is shrimatas. We have so many experiences that is absolutely beautiful. He has given me so many experiences, that now I am also the first shrimatas. One day he came to Me and said, Mother, I am now going to the airport. I will go to India. I said, you are not going to India. No, you are not going to India. Show me the ticket. So, I was the shrimatas of the shrimatas of the Manayakti who came to India. I said, no, I am not going to India. I am not going to India. I am going to the airport. So, he went to the airport and found that he was cancelled. He was being missed. So, he went to the airport and found that he was cancelled. I told him he should have been part of the airport, and I told him. I told you that you are being followed. You should have been part of the airport. No, because I was in the airport. I was in the airport. I was in the airport and found that he was cancelled. He will always ask Me, should I go today or not? Otherwise, if I say no, he will say no. And then when we came back to Delhi, the directions were announced and he says that we were all to be preserved. And then his father was released and he is part of the airport. I was in the airport and I was taken to the airport. I told him that I was taken to the airport. He told me that he was being preserved. We thought he was a monster. He was always organizing the program last day. He was fighting. This Something is possible for you, or for everyone else, to organize programs like this. There is such an loads of news available here. Because you are a provide person who has done this classes These are the last few glasses of clothes if you get a She is not able to get into the world. Easy for them. She is not able to get into the world. You are saying, easy for questions because what they have said about the Holy Ghost, that's the believer, she is the house-liver and she is not comfortable. So, is it not that it is not in the process? I think the vibration is just perfect. But we are not able to get into the world. Because we are not able to get into the world. You are saying that you want to get into the world. No. You are saying that you want to get into the world. So, you are saying that you want to get into the world. So, you are not able to get into the world. But when you are able to get into the world, you are not able to get into the world. Also for questions, if you are asking question on the left hand, the value of Holy Ghost that Christ has sent, immediately your question is answered. You are not getting the question. And when you are asking, you are not able to get into the world. You are saying that you are not able to get into the world. You are saying that you want to get into the world. Because the world is a place. The Christians and Catholics, all of them are here. That is how you can get all these categories. What's your Christian Leadership? No, not at all. Because you all have your classical. I hope we will find way to with ourising something to feel, please note the ested substance. JavaScript Thank you very much.

Satsang with Mooji Satsang with Mooji Satsang with Mooji Satsang with Mooji Satsang with Mooji Satsang with Mooji Satsang with Mooji What is our program, is now? What about home? Is it ready? Just find out. If so, we can have the food now, but then have the program because otherwise it will be very late or if the food is going to take time, then we'll have the program and then the program? One of the people. Shri Mataji, there are some new people here. Not many, about ten of twenty. What we can do, if the food is ready, we can serve them. If the food is not ready, then we'll start the program. Is the food ready? What I'm saying, who is unable to? It will take some time for food and how will they start? I mean, it's been, they've been cooking. No, no, no, what I'm saying, when will they start the program, these people? They've gone home to change, Mother. Their report has to change. They should be back, I'd say, probably in half an hour, I'd say. The food cannot be over by half an hour. Tell them to come after one hour. We can telephone, yes. But ask for the food, first of all, what is the situation in your food? Can you serve it immediately or? Serving means what? In your hand. The food is ready. So you telephone to them, can you come after one hour? Because they've begun to change and rest, they must take it easy, come after one hour. What about their food? They're taking their food over there. You see, because otherwise we should do it quick, if possible. We can. Should eat not too much, like, it's better. Yes, please. That's it? One's suggesting I should make an announcement, Mother. All right, that you can do. Yes, please. Yes, please. Shri Mataji, Mr. Shri Vastava, on behalf of Brighton Centre, it's my very pleasant duty to welcome you to this town. And I'd like also to welcome the new people who have not attended any of our programs prior to this festival. This evening's program is a musical program. We're very privileged to have a program of Indian classical music, which will be commencing in about one hour's time. What we have found through Sahaja Yoga is that music of this kind has a certain coefficient. And carries vibrations which awaken our senses. And so by listening to the classical music of India, really one can enjoy a very deep meditative experience. So I hope that those new people who are here will have such an experience this evening. And really there could not be any more auspicious occasion in which to make the acquaintance perhaps of a new art form other than in the presence of Shri Mataji. So prior to the commencement of the concert, we'll be serving some sapa which I hope also you'll enjoy very much. Thank you. Shri Mataji, May I ask you a question? Can you hear Me? Yes, please. I'm going to ask you a question. Can you hear Me? Yes, please. Can you hear Me? Lift your mouth. You said take it out. Take that out. I think it's good to do. I'll put you here so... It's always a problem when I have to say something. Dr. Spyro and dear Sahaj Yogis and Sahaj Yoginis, I want only to say a few words of thanks and gratitude for the very warm and moving welcome which you have accorded on the occasion of the arrival of Shri Mataji here. As you appreciate, when I say Shri Mataji, I hesitate a little because she also happens to be my wife. But it's a great credit to her that she is fulfilling both roles so well, that of her wife, her mother, her grandmother and at the same time the universal mother. To me, it's a very great privilege to be asked to be here, to be given the opportunity to be here and to feel that one belongs to this glorious family. I am serving the United Nations system and you know the United Nations system was established to bring the world together, to unite the world. Unfortunately, I cannot say that we have succeeded very well. In fact, if you read the newspapers every morning, you will probably see more of division than of unity. And yet we persist in our endeavours to unite the world. But what Shri Mataji is doing and what you are doing is really to create one good, pure, chaste, loving human family. You are giving reality to the ideal of one interdependent humankind. There is a great joy in that, there is a great satisfaction in that, there is a great spiritual elevation in that. And all of that I know you all feel you owe to this lady. Well, I am sure you are anxious to hear her rather than me. I will therefore stop now except to thank you very, very much indeed for your kindness, your affection and your love. Thank you. Thank you very much. And to all those who have found it. Sahaja Yoga is the blessing of modern times, which is meant for the seekers. Seeking also I find me these days has become like a fashion. But there are many who are real seekers, genuine seekers. They are trying all their lives to find the source of peace, joy and bliss. That is the spirit. As you know in Sahaja Yoga, you cannot pay for it, you cannot put in any effort for it, it's your own, it's within you. But after realization, there's one thing that is lacking in many seekers, perhaps maybe, because they cannot give up this seeking shopping as I call it. You have to have consistent movement upward. In Sanskrit it's called saapathya. That is something one has to put in. That effort has to go, otherwise realization is extremely a temporary phase. It doesn't happen in the countries where there has been a tradition of understanding what is to be sought. So it must be understood that it is not a mental approach or a behavioral change, but is a complete transformation within, which is important. For that you have to have patience with yourself. You have to forgive yourself. Actually you have to love yourself. And work it out with delicate handling, I'm sure all of you can achieve a lot. I was really overwhelmed today by the beautiful expression of your love at the railway station. I felt even the trains and the people who were handling them were all moved with that. It was too much. Just the ocean of love flowing, that's all within you, in your heart. It has to flow. You have to open your heart, not with any fear, not with any trouble, not with any barriers, but just openly, just flowing. And you'll be surprised that everybody is anxious to do that. Everyone is anxious to extend their love to you. So for those who have come for the first time, I have to tell them, take it easy. Try to understand. Do not feel hurt. If somebody tells you something, do not get upset with it. It's a situation in which you have to be all right. It is you who has to become, nobody else, it's you who has to gain. With this, if you move, I'm sure, as so many have got realization, you all will establish it. I do not know how to thank you. I mean, I don't know what to say, because people have come from such long distances to express their love. And to meet Me here, it's too much for Me to say anything, except I feel that in My childhood I used to have dreams of having a global family. And I would tell My father that in My family I'll have as many people as there are stars in the sky. But so many are still lost, and I don't know how will I meet them, very anxious. I will do whatever is possible. You all should help Me there, and those who are not yet established must know that it's God's work. We are in a new age, and we have to understand the seriousness of the whole situation. Work it out yourself, and then through you, God's work will be done beautifully, blessing the whole universe. That's what we want. As Mr. Shri Vastu has told you that United Nations is doing its work, it's the tree. But the roots are you. You are the roots of United Nations. If there are no roots, there's no reality. So only if you form organizations, there's no reality. The reality comes from the roots, and you are the roots of all these ideas by which we'll have global peace, global bliss and global emancipation. May God bless you all. I hope all the new people will achieve their ascent with humility, with humility. May God bless you.

So I don't think I'll take much of your time, because everybody is eager to listen to Debuji. But I think it's my duty to at least introduce these great artists. The only thing which I'll say about Debuji, that he's such a great musician, that the government of India has awarded him a great honor, national honor, in the form in the name of Padam Bhushan. Thank you. Thank you. We have been listening to Debuji for the last 10, 12 years. And every time, we got something new from him. Today, what he's going to render before us, I think if he speaks for it, that will be much better. But may I tell you that with him is my respect to Babiji, Mrs. Debu Chaudhhi. Thank you. Thank you. There is a great saying in Hindi, ho nahar birvan ke hoth chikne paath. This means if the tree is very good, the leaves of the tree would also be very good. So as you are seeing before you, dear Pratik, Debuji's son, is sitting next to him. And for your information, nowadays Pratik himself is giving solo performances. Thank you. Thank you. And next to him is the finger player of our old Somnaji. Thank you. So I hand over the mic to Debuji and request all of you to please keep silence throughout the program, especially from the children. If they don't move, that would be very kind of you. Thank you very much. Debuji. Thank you. Thank you. Jayashri Mataji. Coming amongst Sahaja Yogis, as I am one of them, I've never thought myself as an artist. And that is why, as Dr. Nigam said very lightly, when I have been asked, I said yes. I said a number of times that as an artist, I go many, many places all over the world. Here when I come, I don't come as an artist. I come as one of you. Thank you. It is not just saying. It is my heart speaks. I can't speak. I'm not a speaker. But sometimes one has to speak when the moment demands. Once, no. Mataji, I don't have to tell anything about Mataji. I was remembering today's song, you know. I was singing at Mataji. Hari vinatyedo kaun sahay. Mais hoch na gana karatha mein. I was singing kun kun aayi at Mataji vinatyedo kaun sahay. My special attachment, attainment with Sahaja Yogis has a very special significance in my life. Many of you do not know. When I met Mataji about 16 or 17 years ago, I was passing through a problem. And Mataji told me, the first meeting, she said everything will be all right. And since then, I have not looked back. And it is due to Mataji's blessings. Mataji was in Delhi. Why I can't explain, Dr. Nigam will vouch for me. My heart was bleeding to have a darshan. I couldn't. But I felt that when I went to play for the Sahaja Yogis, I felt she was there all around us, all the time. She's always with us. But her presence makes all the difference. Today, I have come, many of you do not know, that I didn't sleep all night last night due to this airline problem. But then when you come here, you forget everything. You have a new life, new lease of life. I have been presenting every time a new raga all the time before Sahaja Yogis. But this time, I have decided to play a raga, which I played in Delhi, because it has a special significance. And I want to play before Mataji also. The name of the raga is Durgaavati. This raga has never been played by anybody in India. Only my guru used to play. Ustanmushta Kalikamu died. And this raga not only has a special significance with the name Durgaavati. You know my Durga is coming very soon now. So to Asher, goddess Durga, Durgaavati, is the apt raga I thought I should play again for Mataji. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And I have no words to express my gratitude, deepest gratitude for all the love, respect, and affection you have been given to me. I don't think I deserve a bit of it. But it is your love, affection for me, for my music. It makes me a special appearance everywhere, whenever I go, wherever I go. And I don't know. I feel that when I play on such occasions, I'm a different artist. I always like to give whatever I can. And I would always be hoping and expecting your good wishes, which is a long way to go. Indian music is a music where no one can reach. Sky is the limit. And I feel still today, after playing for 52 years, I've been playing sitar for the last 52 years, I feel I'm a student even today. I would request you to give your blessings to my son. I hope that tonight I'm going to announce that I'm dedicating and giving my son to Mataji for the cause of tragedy. Thank you very much. Thank you, Jayashri Mataji. We'll play, first of all, a lap. You know, Baba Mama, wherever he is, he makes it a special thing for me. Not only is he a wonderful human being, a great knowledgeable soul. And I hope Baba Mama will give the Bandhan on behalf of everybody so that we get to the point where one strives to reach. First we'll play a lap. You all know because all Swahili jig is now expert on Indian music. It's a great thing. Wherever you go all over the world, I find everybody's counting and saying, wah, wah, wah. So you feel you are at most, you're at home, in the home crowd. First we'll play a lap. Then we'll play a slow composition, which will be set to a cycle of 16 bits. Then we'll play another composition, which is the first time you're playing again, a cycle of 8 and 1 2 bits, 8 and 1 2 bits, which is a very intricate pattern. Then we'll again play the first composition in a cycle of 16 bits. And then all will depend on Mataji, what you do and how you play. So we'll start. And when Mataji will come, we'll give a break, a pause. Then we'll start again. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. As I told you, we have seen that the right moment has come now. I have been searching so far in the ocean of music. So now, Mataji has come. Now, the search is now complete. It's a complete circle. But before I introduce the Rangam to Mataji again, I request Baba Mama to come on the stage. Mataji, with your kind permission, Baba Mama, one abedni se mazani ata. Oh. Gido. Yes. Now, the raga, Mataji, I've already explained to them, is not played by anybody in India. My guru taught me. And what could be the more apt, more everything, I have no words to express for you, to offer this raga to you. The name of the raga is Durga Vati. Thank you. So you know the praise of Durga. You sing the praise of Durga, Mataji. So in this raga, this is a raga which is mostly dual. We deal on the spiritual and aesthetic aspect of the raga. Madhyam vadi hai. Bhava kundya chan lagata. And it is there in Hemadhiya Pancham. And this has a mixture of a little bit of Adi Basant also. That's why it is completely different from other ragas, Dhanisama. You don't find any other raga. Dhanisama jo Adi Basant shuddha vat ke basant. And Mataji's presence, I'm sure, will help me to reach the perfection of the raga. I need His blessings. And Mataji is always there. You can see us smiling all the time, blessing me. I have no words to express. Many of you will be very envious of me. Why Mataji loves me so much, you know. She has given me so much that I have no words to express. And this raga, I request the Sahaja Yogis and composers to compose songs on Mataji. And Bhava mama also requests to you. It's such a raga, beautiful raga, I feel very much involved, weep within myself. And this is a raga which I have, with great care and attention, I have taught my son also. He played. And let us all pray for a longer life for Mataji. In Hindi we have a saying, Meri Humar Lakh Jai, Hamari Humar Lakh Jai. I cannot express my feeling. I can only express with my music, which I will. She was so near to us in Delhi, I couldn't see her. So what a joy it is for me today. Recently, Mataji was in America. I was in India, I was in India, I was in India. I was in India, I was in India. I was in India, I was in India. Recently, today, recently, Mataji was in America. I told her, Mataji, why should you work so hard? You should take rest. I feel tired. She said, look at me, I am over 70, you are talking to me like that? But you see, we need her so much. We need her so much, so much, that we need her all the time with us to bless us, to bless all of us, to bless the whole world, a world where we can all live in peace. And you know, in Ganpati Puli, in this month, normally it's very cool, you know, you need warm clothes. When Mataji comes, she balances the nature. I remember once, by performing Mataji's seating, the moon, you know, remember Mataji in Ganpati Puli? Stay still, you know. So, no words would be enough to, well, nobody talk about my talk about Mataji, I am very small that way. I can only offer my feelings, my prayer through my music. And I have already said, Mataji, that my son is for you, for the Sahaja Yoga. I have dedicated him to this. And, Mataji, one more thing. We are playing a mantra, a beat of 8 and a half beats also today. It's very delicate, intricate, and we need your blessings. Jai Shri Mataji. Once again, let us all pray for a long, long, long life of Mataji, for Mataji. Thank you. Shri Mataji, you have got a very good excuse for Mataji to look at him. What do you think about Mataji's excuse? No. Swamiji didn't have an excuse for Mataji to look at him. So, he has got an excuse now. He burnt his hand, you know, not his finger. I have to give an excuse to Mataji to excuse me. And he has composed a lot of things. He has made a lot of things. He has made a lot of things. He has made a lot of things. He has made a lot of things. What is your excuse? What is it? What is it? Is it a song? What is it? Is it a song? Is it a song? No, no, no. I have to give an excuse. I have to give an excuse. I have to give an excuse. It's fine. I will give you an excuse. I have to give an excuse. I have to give an excuse. I have to give an excuse. You are not allowed to say anything. You are not allowed to say anything. You are

It was really another great evening for all of us and people are so creative, I'm surprised the way they brought up such a difficult subject, controversial to so many theories already established. So you have seen how people can really understand now, Sahaja Yoga, better through the media of a theatre. Because to talk like this in the public is an impossible situation. Because they would never accept such a theory of a Kundalini coming as a serpent. But with this kind of a drama I'm sure one day it will go into their heads that they need transformation wherever. I don't know how to thank all of you, specially those who acted, for bringing out the beauty of such a subtle and a difficult subject. I knew what was on what they were doing it. When I saw the snake I knew what it was. But still I must say I never expected such manifestation of the beautiful ideology, I should say beautiful reality, which people don't know. I'm not prepared to go beyond their rational mind to understand. But if the priests tell them, or if a mullah tells them, or if a buddhist tell them, then they're willing to accept. But if sahaja yogis tell them the reality, they should accept. Because first they'll have the experience. Once they have the experience, then they will believe that this is the reality. And this is how things have worked out. Perhaps I've not written about it in My book or nowhere, because they will put Me into court, I think everything, they'll come to know about it. But the way you have done it is really so convincing, so beautifully convincing to people that we should take it out wherever possible, maybe I'll try, somebody in India might try from the television, maybe. If they have some courage they might do it. Now as it is, times are very vibrant and many things are happening at this time. You can notice that so many things are happening, because they have played with the ignorance of people and cheated them and miscarried them. But you know the reality, you have had the experience and you know what you are capable of, what you can do. I would just suggest that you are not alone like Adam and Eve, you are so many. And you won't suffer like the saints have suffered. On the contrary you will get a great joy in giving realizations to others and talking about Sahaja Yoga. That will be the most enjoyable thing for you, remarkable for you and away is great satisfaction for you. You have to go round and spread the news that the time has come for you to have transformation. I'll give you an example what things are happening. Like in Turkey, we had a big earthquake and there not a single Sahaja Yogi got any, any problem. Their houses were safe, the things were safe, all such Sahaja Yogis are safe. Today I receive a letter from a girl who was travelling by this London train which met with the accident. The parents have written to Me that she had My locket and at the time when the train just bumped into each other, this girl actually was not sitting on the bench as such but she was looking at something. As a result she never get that jumping or you can say that blow and she said that she was just driven to the door before the fire started and she's safe. Many people who are under attack will be saved, there's no doubt about it and many people who are to be destroyed will be destroyed. But it's not the human beings that will be destroyed but the wrong concept under which people have been tortured, troubled, imprisoned, mesmerized. All those concepts will be exposed and that will show that really the Satya Yuga has started. It is a very great time you are born that you could all get your realization and you can enter into this eternal life of truth. It's something very fortunate on your part and fortunate for Me also that I met you all and that you all came along and understood Me. It's difficult to understand a person like Me because I say controversial things but still you accepted it because of your experience. So tomorrow I'm going to tell you what is the job of a Mahakali and you'll be amazed how you are blessed by this Mahakali power. As far as today is concerned I must congratulate all of those who have made this drama so wonderful and so successful. It's something very, very well done and also the way you have made the stage and everything is remarkable. You have worked very hard. You must say the English are known for their dramas, very good dramas they used to make. Not now but they used to make I would say because now I can't see some of the dramas you are having there. But such nice dramas you had and such sense of acting and rendering different scenes you had. All that is was your speciality. And today I see the English coming round, I should say the British, coming round and showing such beautiful sense of acting and sense of production of the whole theme which is so difficult. The way it was brought in I don't know. Anybody would congratulate you for that. As far as I'm concerned I'm really amazed how you could achieve such a difficult task. So all My love and all My blessings to you all. I must say for Pawar also that he came all the way because I said he must come and he was in a very unhappy mood when I met him. But I'm sure one day he'll prosper now very well and how he worked hard to express himself in different beats, talas, different beats, in different ways. Of course now you all have started understanding this complicate thing, complicate thing like our Indian rhythms. But they are very rhythmic and they are not only rhythmic but they are very systematic and scientific and they all have a great meaning. So I'm very happy that you all have enjoyed that dancing very much, you encouraged him. And next time he says he'll bring some lady who is also dancing with him so we'll have some other dancing also. As it is tomorrow's time we have to fix for the puja. I said about two o'clock we'll be all right because we'll finish by, I hope, by seven or eight because it's not so very cold but it is becoming surprisingly this time it was quite sensible. The nature has been very kind and tomorrow if anybody wants to meet Me or see Me can also come about say twelve o'clock and all the leaders also can come and see Me tomorrow at twelve o'clock. I hope that suits you all. I don't know how much to say because I'm really overwhelmed by the production of this beautiful drama and the music of power. I mean I wish him all good luck and I'm sure he'll show his delicate sides also and also his creativity in a much more fragrant way. Though today he has worked very hard I must say I never expected he was in such an happy mood but he's done so well. Then also this thing that he has trained Sahaja Yoginis. This idea came to Me, I know it, I just felt that if I tell him he'll take it up. But he took it up so well and all the girls were dancing so beautifully. I thought the Brindavan has come here or what? The way they danced in such a good rhythm and everything. It was very surprising, very, very surprising how these girls who never had training in Kathak or in Indian dancing or in Indian music did so well understanding the importance of rhythm and also of the... You see I get lost with English language sometimes but I should say it was the theme, theme of the subject. The theme has to be expressed but the complicated rhythm is such that you should know how to come to the first one that is Samayas we call it. It's a very, very difficult thing but the way you have understood the point and the way you are doing it, I mean I can't believe it really because I used to think that when I went to London I felt the girls are walking like horses, like this. All their hair, they had, you see, small hair and they used to jump like this. So I said, how can these girls ever understand the delicacy of rhythm? But not the black people are not. Black people I have seen, even if they are going for a funeral, they'll be dancing with the tune, you know. But in England I was surprised because they are so fond of horses that I think horses had a great influence in their way of life. But now I think it's gone, it's not so much. It must change the way the girls did the dance very, very graciously, very delicately. I must say what a transformation and what a beautiful drama of the whole thing. So I must also thank our gentleman, Mr. Sukhwinder Singh. Sukhwinder means the one who gives joy and he's really very joy giving. I didn't know he could play with a Kathak dancer. I didn't know. I'd never seen him before with Pawar or anyone. But Pawar told Me that he does play. I was very happy because he's a very good player, very rare and one day he'll become a world famous player, no doubt. Then the other gentleman who played on the Santhura also was very well accomplished, I must say. Though I think I've heard him before or I've seen him before, face sounds familiar. But he's very much synchronizing with the whole thing and it's very surprising. I've never seen any Santhura player playing with the dancers. At the most a harmonium fellow could be there singing but never a Santhura player and he brought all the deficiencies of a singer in his playing. It was, you never felt missing that singer or a musician behind. It was so well done. I congratulate him also with all the rest of them and may God bless them and give them long life to entertain the whole world. May God bless you all. Hope to see you tomorrow at two o'clock. I hope two o'clock will maintain the time. All right? Tomorrow there is only brunch so I think we can manage. Thank you very much. Thank you all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

this was I am not a man of the mind. I am a man of the mind. I am not a man of the mind. I am not a man of the mind. I am not a man of the mind. I am not a man of the mind. I am not a man of the mind. I am not a man of the mind. I am not a man of the mind. I am not a man of the mind. I am not a man of the mind. I am not a man of the mind. I am not a man of the mind. I am not a man of the mind. I am not a man of the mind. I am not a man of the mind. I am not a man of the mind. I am not a man of the mind. I am not a man of the mind. Vishwa Vandita Nirmala Mata Sarva Pujika Nirmala Mata Vishwa Vandita Nirmala Mata Sarva Pujika Nirmala Mata Sarva Pujika Nirmala Mata Sarva Pujika Nirmala Mata Sarva Pujika Nirmala Mata Sarva Pujika Nirmala Mata Vishwa Vandita Vishwa Vandita Sarva Pujika Nirmala Mata Nirmala Mata Nirmala Mata Nirmala Mata Nirmala Mata Nirmala Mata Nirmala Mata Yes. Yes, yes. I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the very outset we have to know that truth is what it is. We cannot change it. We cannot describe it. Also at this human level we cannot know it. It is to be known on our central nervous system as an experience. From where in Sanskrit they have a word called Bodh. Means enlightenment. Also from there comes the word Buddha. Means the one who is enlightened. Also there is another Sanskrit word called as Vidam. Also to know on your central nervous system. From there the word Vedas. Now you should understand for your English study process as human beings you did not gain. You did not do anything as such. And you have achieved this human awareness. But this is not absolute. This is relative. And in these modern times a new type of people are born. They may belong to any country, any race, any religion. Who are very restless and are seeking the truth. They don't know how to satisfy this restlessness. So they are looking out for the solution, for the peace. This restlessness is sometimes takes you to wrong paths. There are many who know that this restlessness started and they are in the market of selling solutions. You cannot sell it. It is a happening, it's an actualization. Like us human beings we have achieved many things. For example an animal doesn't understand beauty, he doesn't understand cleanliness. But we human beings are very sensitive about it. But we are not sensitive of our spirituality. And we cannot recognize a real spiritual person and a false one. That is how we are lost. I was told in Brazil there are many churches in the name of God who are just collecting money. How much did we pay to Christ? On the contrary he was sold for thirty yards. So you cannot have a market. With this restlessness we have to understand that there is something deeper happening to our awareness. And our energy it looks exhausted. It's not sufficient to survive or cope with your life. So very a search for a higher energy maybe from outside or maybe from inside. That is only possible if you become a spirit. Whatever I am going to tell you today please don't take it for granted. You have to be absolutely clean, understanding, like a scientist, open hearted. If what I say is proved then you have to accept it. Because it is for your benevolence, it is for the benevolence of your country and for the benevolence of the whole world. It is for your benevolence, for the benevolence of your country and for the benevolence of the whole world. So what is the mystery behind it? You have been already told about this mechanism that is within us. This mechanism is present in all of you, among all the human beings. Sangha is with you, is more with you. You all have the right to get this yoga, means the union, with this All-Pervading Divine power. You see all these beautiful flowers, we take them for granted. We don't even think how they happen, they happen. Who does this work? Who changes the seasons? Who made us human beings? There is a universal power of Divine Love, All-Pervading. So the union with this All-Pervading power is the yoga, is the spiritual yoga. So there are two truths. One is that you are not this body, this mind, this intellect, these emotions. Sorry, and these conditionings, six things. But you are the pure Spirit. This is the first truth about yourself. The second truth is that there is an All-Pervading power of Divine Love. In the Bible it is described also as the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. In the Quran it is described as Ruh. And in India scriptures it is described as Paramachaitanya. This is what we have to achieve. For which we have a power within ourselves in the triangular bone called as sacrum. That means that we knew about this bone as being sacred. This is your own power. It is your own Mother, the real. And She is anxious to give you your second birth. That means you have to be born again. But it is not a certificate or a grant that we are born again. But by this you really become a Self-realized enlightened personality. You really become a Self-realized enlightened personality. Firstly you know the Absolute Knowledge, on your fingertips. There are seven centers within us, just like energy centers. So when this Kundalini power rises, She enlightens all of them, indigres them. And when it joins with this All-Pervading power, the whole power starts flowing in us. Like this instrument if it is not connected to the veins, it has no identity. In the same way human beings have no identity. So you have to be connected to this All-Pervading power, which is the ocean of knowledge. Of Absolute Knowledge. It is not mental, beyond mind. It is the ocean of compassion and love. It is the ocean of bliss and joy. Above all it is the ocean of forgiveness. And whatever mistakes you have committed are easily dissolved in it. Even your genes change database, that the wrong database that they have. In England they had a problem. A bishop became adulteress. And he said, what can I do? Because my genes are not alright. So the archbishop didn't know what to do. At least the archbishop should have told him that you cannot be a bishop if you are an adulteress. You can't do all kinds of nonsense worse than a sinner and call yourself a bishop. Making money, corruption, worse than even normal human beings. Worse than even normal human beings. But archbishop did not do that. So he sent him a message that if you take to Sahaja Yoga, your database of genes will change, will become same gene. There are seven doctors in London and they are going to have a meeting with the archbishop about it. We must wish them luck. Because they are very conditioned people. They think they are doing their jobs. And they need not have any spiritualities in them. It's only in Brazil I was surprised that the ministers and the government is talking of spirituality. I was surprised that the ministers and the government is talking of spirituality. This is the only country where people are being linked to the efficiency or the inefficiency or you can call the insufficiency of our human power. And that we should have some power, another power from within or from without. Nowhere in the world you will find people of that level at the helm of affairs think of such things. Though in India we have thousands and thousands of people, but our government is not bothered. Another place is Russia where they are talking of morality as the basis. Not the forced morality like the Islam but innate morality. So why this happening? The first thing I told you that you know absolute knowledge on your fingertips. These are seven centers, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven which are ending from the sympathetic areas. Left side are emotional and right side are physical and brain activities. When this happening takes place I told you that it nourishes those centers through which it passes. All our physical, mental, emotional, spiritual problems coming because these centers are in Jeopardy. All our physical problems, emotional, mental, spiritual problems coming because these centers are in Jeopardy. By this happening your physical being completely gets into normal state. In India there are four doctors who have got their PhD in Sahaja Yoga for curing incurable illnesses. In India there are five or six doctors who have got their PhD in Sahaja Yoga for curing incurable illnesses. Not through medicines, not through operations, nothing. And also there have been many cancer cures in India for doing nothing. If such a system is accepted in Brazil, so much money can be saved. Then your mental problems of many kinds, even through mercy, can be cured. Depression and all other things, depression. You drop all your bad habits. In the modern times the idea is that you must enjoy each and every moment of your life. But all this enjoyment is self-destructive. You take to anything, it destroys you. And somehow the whole mental makeup is such that you should destroy yourself. All the mental states that we have to destroy ourselves. For example, Gharamini, and they have another one in Spain, what you call the bullfights. Also it can go to any limit like carrying Himalayas. All the time taking up challenges of useless value. There was a lady who climbed Himalayas recently without any oxygen. She has two very sweet little children. But she was not satisfied, so she wanted to climb another one for as few as three. And then she died of an avalanche. So till you die you are doing something nonsensical. As if you are against your own existence. All such nonsensical things I think are because human beings do not have themselves. They don't know how glorious they are. They don't know how brave they are. It's kind of a stupid arrogance that they want to destroy themselves. And they say it is joy. It is not joy. Joy is pure. It is eternal. It is not pure like happiness and unhappiness. It is singular. It is joy giving in the sense that it nourishes you. It guides you, gives you wisdom. And it gives you compassion and strength in your virtues. This is the state we have to achieve. It is potential within you, it exists there. Only you have to become Self-realized souls. It breaks your attention and light you. Wherever you put your attention, you work, you act. Your attention so much it proves that you become financially perfect. You become a satisfied soul. Not only that but you are empowered. That you can give realizations to others. You can give joy to others. And your thoughts that make you restless settle down and you become a peaceful person. You are all the time jumping on the cusp of thoughts, what rises, what not rises and what not. It comes from future or the past. So when this Kundalini rises, it wronged these thoughts. And there is a space in between which is absolutely thoughtless. So you become thoughtlessly aware. You are fully aware but you are thoughtless. Thus your inner peace is established. Here you grow spiritually. Not in the future because doesn't exist. Not in the past because finished. Reality is the present. But if I say that you grow into a present, you come. But after realization you become absolutely thoughtlessly aware and you get inspirations. The absolute truth. Thus you really become what you are here for. That means you enter into the kingdom of God. And this very much today is an invitation. Nothing has to be told, don't do this, don't do that. You only see in the knowledge of the Spirit that whatever is destructive has to be given up. You have the power All this is in these modern times had to work out. This is the last judgment. You have to judge yourself. In the Quran is written, you judge yourself on your finger tips. At the time of resurrection. So this is the time of resurrection for then all of you should benefit and become enlightened personalities. I am sure you all are going to become. Have confidence. Last time I think we had the whole hall full here. I don't know, they must be sleeping or something. You cannot be careful about it. See it is like sprouting the seed. And once you have sprouted the seed, the seed must grow into a tree. Is the, what Christ has said, that some seeds got sprouted and fell into rocks. Is like that. So you have to grow. For this you have to come to our centers. You don't have to pay anything. But you have to give little land to yourself. That way I must say, I found in the Eastern Rock, one good thing communism has come to them. That at least sixty percent people are not materialistic. They are great seekers. And once they get realization they just get into it. And not the Americans. They are already lynched by all the Hindus. And they were very happy that they purchased their gurus. So now it's a very great chance for you to grow and become a female promoter of this goodness in your country. Your country has many problems which I have been studying. But by getting this power you will make your country very powerful. And so many problems you can solve in such a manner that the whole world will be amazed. The whole world will be amazed. This process will take hardly ten minutes. And you don't have to repeat it also. It will work out, I know. But afterwards you must pay attention to it. It's a saying that when you find a little water in the earth, you can't keep the wealth there. Don't go digging all over the place. It's a saying that when you find a little water in the earth, you can't keep the wealth there. You have to keep the wealth there. Then another thing, I cannot force Self-realization on you. It has to be asked for. If you do not want it, please leave the hall. But please don't disturb other people for those ten minutes. It is not meant for people who are arrogant or with a critical mind. Of course not for idiots to be free. So those who want to leave should leave now. You must keep your mind open because it is for your... I do not want, I do not need Self-realization. But it is for you I have come on the way. I am getting paid free in Brasilia and Brazilians. No doubt, Brasilia is a spiritual country in the sense there is spirituality in the Mother Earth and around. But people have to be spiritual so that they are helped. By nature. By nature. After this you find so many coincidences which you cannot explain. Then you will understand these are the blessings of this All-Pervading Power. So should I request those who do not want to have their realization to leave the hall? Now there are three conditions which you have to follow which are very simple. Now there are three conditions which you have to follow which are very simple. The first one is that you all should have full confidence that you will get your realization wherever you are sitting. The second one is that you should know that God loves you and you have no business not to forgive yourself. At this moment you should completely forgive yourself. At this moment you are not a sinner, not you have done anything wrong that you are guilty. I assure you, you have faith in yourself. As I have taken you, as I love you, you should also love yourself. Because this is the birth of Divine Love. Now the third one is that you have to forgive everyone who has embittered you, troubled you or insulted you. Don't even think about them because they are ready. Logically whether you forgive or you don't forgive you don't do anything. Logically if you forgive, you don't do anything. But if you don't forgive, then you are made into wrong hands on your lives. If you forgive, you are not doing anything wrong. Now this center which is between the optic chiasma like this is very constricted. And if you don't forgive, it won't open. At this moment please forgive everyone so that it opens like this. Just to say, just to say that I forgive everyone in general. Otherwise how will the Kundalini penetrate? And you will get such an important thing as yourself, that is. Now few things have to be done to nourish your centers which we'll show you first. Please take out your shoes because this Mother Earth helps us a lot. You can keep the socks. Now the left and the right are true powers as I told you. So those who are sitting on the chair should put their feet apart but those who are on the ground are alright. Now the right represents two kinds of and the right who are sitting on the chair should put their feet apart but those who are on the ground are alright. Those who are on the ground should put their feet apart. Now somebody has to show you. You can show yourself. You can show yourself. He will show you. And you put your left hand towards Me on your lap, very comfortably sitting. As I said, you can put your feet on the chair, your feet should be straight like that, your feet should be straight like that, your feet should be straight like that. You shouldn't sit very straight like that or just now like that but in a simple manner. Now in the heart resides the Spirit, which is the reflection of God Almighty. So please put your right hand on your heart. We are working on your heart, no size. We are working on the left hand side. If you become the Spirit, in the light of the Spirit you become your own guide, your own master. So take your hand on the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. This is the center of your master. Now please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. This is the center of pure Divine knowledge. Now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen. Now on your heart. Now in the corner of your neck and shoulders and turn your head your right. This center goes into your body when you feel guilty. It can give you diseases like angina, lethargic organs and spondylitis. Now take your right hand on top of your forehead and put down your head. This is the center we have to forgive everyone in general. Now take your right hand on the back side of your head and turn your head upward without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction you have to ask forgiveness from the All-Pervading power of God. Now the last center is where you stretch your palm fully. Put the center of your palm on top of the fontanelum for 80. Now please put down your head as far as possible. Now most important thing is to push back your fingers so there's a good pressure on your scalp. Now your scalp seven times clockwise slowly, this is the actualization of your baptism you'll get. Bend your hands, bend your hands. That's all we have to do. Now, again put your feet apart from each other, left hand on your left side and right hand on the heart and please close your eyes, not lightly and don't open them till I tell you. At the heart center you have to ask everybody fundamental position about yourself today. Please ask in your heart, you can call me Mother or Shri Mother. Please ask the question three times, Mother am I the Spirit? I told you that if you become the Spirit, you become your own master. So please take your right hand on the left side of your abdomen in the upper part and push it there and ask another fundamental question about yourself. Now, ask three times again, Mother am I my own master? I've already told you that I cannot force your enlightenment nor can I force pure Divine Knowledge on you. You have to ask for it. So, please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and here you have to ask six times because this center has got six buttons. Here you ask Mother, please give me pure Divine Knowledge, six times. As soon as you ask for Divine, your knowledge, the Kundalini starts rising. So we have to cleanse our upper centers with our full self determination. Determination and Confidence. Now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen and here you say with your full self confidence, Mother, I am your Self. Now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen and here you say with your full self confidence, Mother, I am my own master. Say ten times. And the very outset I told you that you are not this body, this mind, this intelligence, these emotions, this ego, these conditionings but you are the pure Spirit. So now raise your right hand on your heart and say it again with full confidence twelve times, Mother, I am the pure Spirit. I have already told you that you should not feel guilty at this moment because this all prevailing power is the ocean of knowledge, place and compassion. But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness and whatever mistakes you have committed are easily dissolved into this ocean of forgiveness. Now please forgive yourself and put your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and put your head to your right. Here sixteen times you have to say it in full confidence, Mother, I am not guilty at all. I have already told you whether you forgive or you don't forgive logically you don't do anything but if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands. And at this moment, this center which is very constricted you have to forgive for the Kundalini to come through. So please now put your right hand on top of your forehead and put down your head. Please put down your legs. Here you have to say from your heart not how many times, Mother, I forgive everyone in general. Now without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes you have to forgive others for your own success. You have to ask for forgiveness from the All-Purgaging Power. Now please put your right hand on the back and back your head. At this center you have to say again from your heart not how many times, Oh the Mind-Power, please forgive me if I have done anything knowingly or unknowingly. Now the last center is very important. You have to stretch your palm fully and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area and bend your head. Here again I cannot force. Self-realization on you, you have to ask for it. Push back your fingers and put down your head and move your scalp seven times slowly saying, Mother, please give me my Self-realization, my enlightenment.

The video is required on the stage. Is Harbat here also? Greedo? This passage is clear. There is no one standing near the gate. The people who are standing near the welcome gate must clear that immediately. The shimataji is coming and it will be followed by a procession. There should be nobody standing near the gate.

Bride having sixty-one number is missing, so she should occupy that number. Everybody must sit on the proper number, otherwise you will have wrong husbands. The brides have to look down, close their eyes and be in meditative mood. Those of the brides who are feeling nervous, they should not feel so, because I can tell you the husbands are more nervous than you. So that is an encouraging point. Please feel comfortable. And be in meditative mood.

You are Shakti, have you cleared the gate? All the bridesmaids who are assigned to the various brides must move with the bride and stand by her side when they occupy their respective place. Bride number twenty-nine is missing. When the brides move, people sitting here on the left will have to allow them space enough for their movement. So you will have to sit accordingly. The brides will move in this direction and occupy their places. And the bridegrooms will come from this side. The various relations of each couple and the bridesmaid should be standing very close to the place allotted for the bride and the bridegroom, so that no time is lost when the wedding is taking place and there is no confusion about the relations. Is there any confusion about the number in anybody's mind, in the bride's mind? The brides must ensure that they sit on the number allotted to them. That is very important. Now, Albert is checking and you better be careful about the numbers. They are coming. Outside.

Your attention, please. At the time of this Haldi program, some Sahaj Yogi from the West, I think, has dropped this clock somewhere. This small wristwatch. I think it has come off from this tab. It's a Russian Sahaj Yogi, I think. This was found at the place of the Haldi program. Another thing, Mrs. Uma Sangal from Renukut had left her bag at that place. One more point. Dr. Valentina from Russia has forgotten her dark glasses with Mrs. Marjan. Kindly collect the same from her. Thank you.

Please stand in the line. Mrs. Jayka, Mrs. Murthy, Mrs. Nigam, all leaders' wives. Mrs. Vaidyugoparan, Mrs. Talwar. Mrs. Sangvi and Gadkari's concern of heaven. Mrs. Dixi and Mrs. Samasti. Mr. Magdo, one of the brides has dropped her anklets here. The bridesmaids should kindly check whether their brides are having both the anklets. If one of the whosoever is not having, kindly come and collect here. The bridesmaids should come here and collect the anklets from here. Mr. Kuna Chaturi, you have been told that you are not allowed to collect. Mrs. Talwar, please. Mrs. Dalampap. This is Galapap. Go on. Mrs. Nigam. Motherly woman. Who's for? Mrs. Vaidyugoparan. This is Jyotir. This is Mughal. Please follow this. This is Venugopalan. Who's here? Mrs. Jaeckel. Mrs. Alastair. Mrs. Sangwe. Mrs. Ghatkari.

The foreign Sahaja Yogis have decided to give some presents to the ladies who have danced for them. The box is already there. The present is marked with the box. Magdoom Sahib. Mr. Magdoom please. Mrs. Ghatkari.

Now the boy has to make an anjali and the girl, I mean the bridegroom and the bride I mean, the bridegroom has to put their hands together like an anjali as you know. On top of that the girl has to put her anjali. When the bridegroom's bride's mother has to put the water. Then the father has to say the following things. I read it in English and then it will be said. The bridegroom's hand would be under the bride's hand in anjali. Bride's hand would be above the bridegroom's hand, put together, touching each other. And there's a plate, hold it below that. The mother has to pour water. Now here, bride's father is saying, my daughter is a Sahaja Yogini and she has accepted the Vishwaniramadhar. Also I and her mother are followers of Vishwaniramadhar. Considering that you are the best Sahaja Yogi, I offer my daughter to you in the auspicious and divine presence of Shri Mataji. So keeping fully in mind the importance of this great function, please give complete respect to it. Now on this side I see the mothers have not come forward and poured the water. The mothers of the bride must come ahead and pour the water on the hands of the bride. Just a little of water. Now the bridegroom has to say at this time, all of you have to say, of course I will comply with it, I'll accept it in your heart. All the bridegrooms have to say that. In Sanskrit it is Aham Sveekar Omi.

Now there's a thread to be tied with a turmeric attached on the left hand wrist of the bride and the bride should do so on the right hand side of the bridegroom. First the bridegroom should tie the thread with turmeric attached on the left hand wrist of the bride and the bride should do so on the right hand wrist of the bridegroom. With this tying of the turmeric thread, both the bride's and the bridegroom have to say this. I am reading it. Please repeat this in your minds. It is with the blessings of Sri Adi Shakti that I accept the auspicious bond of this marriage and pray. Now they have to pray in their hearts. May the Sahaja Yoga grow. May the Self-realization grow. May the satisfaction and peace grow. Then they further say, may we always have by the blessings of Adi Shakti the sensitivity of Chaitanya, the life without ego, the joy of Sahaja ethics, the energy and enthusiasm to do the Sahaja Yoga work. After saying all this, the brides and bridegrooms should sprinkle the vibrated akshatas over the heads of each other.

Now this is the time again you have to now tie up the mangalsutra. The bridegroom should apply the akshatas vibrated vermilion on the forehead of the bride and tie the mangalsutra around the neck of the bride. While the following is being recited on behalf of the bridegroom. The bridegroom has to say in the mind. I am reading it. Please repeat this in your mind. I am tying the mangalsutra, that is the thread of auspiciousness, as that which is of the form of Chaitanya. That which is pure, chaste and auspicious. That which is verily the thread of the Chaitanya and auspicious. The vati ulti aap aa jiye. Put it the other way round. You will have to reverse it. The bowl shape. While tying the Mangalsutra, the bridegroom says in his mind. I am reading it. Please repeat it in your mind. I am tying the Mangalsutra which is the thread of auspiciousness as that which is of the form of Chaitanya. That which is pure, chaste and auspicious. That which is verily the thread of Chaitanya and auspiciousness and hence it is called the Mangalsutra.

Now you have got the shoulder cloth on the bridegrooms and ladies have the saris so a knot has to be tied by the bride's maid. It should be tied in such a way that you will be able to move together. Now the bride and bridegroom have to recite the thing in their hearts. Please repeat it after Me in your minds, both bride and bridegroom. While our shoulder cloths are being tied together in knot, we fully realize that this relationship has been fixed through the Sahaja Yoga and it is only through the Sahaja Yoga that it will become pure and strong.

Now there is laja ho. Before igniting the light, this mantra has to be said of Shri Ganesha in your heart. He'll read it for you. Om gananaam tvaam ganapatim havaam ahe Kabim kave na mupashravastamam Jai sthara jam brahma nam brahma naspata aana Shraddhu vannadi bhi siddha sadanam Vakar thundam aa kaya surya koti samaprabha Nirvignam kurume deva sarva karesha sarvada Om tva meva sakshatsri ganesha sakshatsri Adi Shakti mata ji sri nirmala devya namoha namaha. Now the mama should ignite the fire.

We have to put those puffed rice and to worship the fire first of all. Now to start with the aahootis, the bridegroom should drop ghee three times. Three times the bridegroom must offer ghee to the fire. Now the oblations start. For the oblations you have to drop the parched grain. Both bride and bridegroom. Puffed rice has to be put together. The bride's brother, if he is there or the father could do, has to give those puffed rice for such other in the hand of the bride, bridegroom. You see all this is very symbolic. Try to understand. This is Agni. Now what is the quality of Agni is first of all that it burns. So and it creates heat. For that a person who is very heated up you must put some ghee means you must try to soothe him. Also this puffed rice because it is also that the fire wants food to be consumed. For that you must put puffed rice to fulfill the hunger of the fire.

Now with the first oblation the bridegroom say, both the bride's and bridegroom they say in their minds, the first oblation please drop the puffed rice into the fire and say it repeated in your minds. Very important. While the sacred fire is witness we invoke our own Kundalini's and pray that all our faults, negativity and conditioning be burnt into ashes in the light of the Kundalini. Now Kundalini also moves like fire. She goes against the gravity. But it's a silent fire which soothes everything.

The second oblation. Take the puffed rice again in your hands. And please repeat what I read in your minds. While the sacred fire is witness we promise that we will be like flames in Sahaja Yoga and we shall kindle the flames in others too. Please drop the puffed rice into the fire.

Now starts the third oblation. Please again take the puffed rice in your hands. I am reading it now repeat in your mind. While the sacred fire is witness we promise that we shall evolve to maturity all that is immature in us. It is important you must know what you are doing.

Now starts the fourth oblation. Please again take the puffed rice. I am reading it. Please repeat after me in your minds. While the sacred fire is witness we promise that we shall not support or take the side of those people who are not following the Sahaja Dharma. We also promise that we shall pay great regards to all Sahaja Yogis as they would be befitting to saints and sadhus and extend all hospitality to them. Please drop the puffed rice.

Fifth oblation. Again take the puffed rice in your hands and repeat after me in your minds. While the sacred fire is witness we resolve to lead the life with all humility within the bariyadas, limits of Sahaja Yoga like the fire which limits itself inside the firewood because the Kundalini is the cool power of the Divine Agni within us. You must pay attention to what is being read because that is very important.

After the offering the bride and the bridegroom should stand up. And they have to go round the sacred fire. For three steps the bride will lead the bridegroom. Please the relations please make sure that the fire keeps burning. And you will go round the fire clockwise. The first three circles will be led by the bride. Now listen there are seven mounds of rice kept there. You have to be careful not to break them. If they are already disturbed please put them right. You have to go round seven times and take seven mounds. And after finishing every vow then you come round and you have to cancel with your foot one of the mounds. With your Nabhi toe you have to cancel. Every time you finish one round you have to cancel. Right Nabhi of your feet. Very precise.

Now please start the first round. I am reading it. Please repeat after me in your mind. The first round. Now this is bride tales to bridegroom. I remember Sri Adi Shakti Sri Mataji in my heart and tell you that you must keep the chastity that would be necessary for good bhuladhara. Our well being and auspiciousness lies in completely accepting full respect of innocence and forsaking cunningness. Now the first round is over. So now use your right Nabhi.

Now the second one. Very important. First listen what he has to say and then you go round. For the second round. I remember Sri Adi Shakti Mataji in my heart and tell you that the divine aesthetics of married life should be seen in our daily life. Our home should be aesthetically decorated. Like planets and stars that are revolving within the limits of their orbits at specific distances. We should do all our work within and strictly abiding by the dharma. I shall extend all hospitality to Sahaja Yogis and fully associate with you in performing the duties towards dharma. May we both achieve the blessings of enjoying the joy of collectivity.

Third round. I am reading it. Please repeat after me in your mind. I remember the message of Adi Shakti in my heart and tell you that I will hand over all the money that I earn to you fully realizing that it has come to me as the reward of your punya. You should spend that money carefully and only after consulting me. Keeping in mind that all the wealth belongs to God, we should spend our wealth whatever possible with the feeling that we are receiving the God's blessings. There should be no hankering for material objects and becoming completely detached with a he. We should nourish our Mahalakshmi principle. Now move and take the third circle.

Now the boy has to come forward. The bridegroom has to come forward. This is what the boy has to say now. Fourth round. I remember Sri Adi Shakti Mataji in my heart and tell you that I will never hurt your feelings and shall forget all the mistakes made by both of us in our past lives. My love for you would be limitless and so should be yours. Please do not suppress your feelings and never hesitate to tell me if for some reasons your mind is at anguish or someone troubles you. I shall always stand by you, protect you and shall never listen to any false complaints against you. Now you take the fourth circle. And the bridegroom will remove the fourth morn.

Now the fifth one is for the bride to say. Please repeat it in your mind. I remember Sri Adi Shakti Mataji in my heart and tell you that I shall bring the divine sweetness in your life. I shall cook delicious food that can be enjoyed by you. We should eat only the food cooked by Sahaja Yogis. Please do not force me to meet or be in the company of those who are not good Sahaja Yogis. We should never use between ourselves abusive or bad language and should never shout at each other. You should quietly listen to me and I shall also quietly listen to you. You have dislodged the bound now.

Now the sixth round. I remember Sri Adi Shakti Mataji in my heart and tell you that we both should regularly meditate and teach our children and also our friends how to meditate. Our life should be that of penance, tapasya, but we should not complain or unnecessarily tell others about it and should be happy in all circumstances. Your eyes should be pure and free from lust for women and without greed for anything.

Seventh round now. Listen now please. I remember Sri Adi Shakti Mataji in my heart and tell you that we should truly understand that Her Holiness Sri Mataji Nirmala Devi has conferred her great basings on us and so we should completely surrender and dedicate our hearts to Her. This dedication should be through complete integration of body, mind and intellect. We should be aware how tremendous and unprecedented work is the self-realization and rest everything in our life is unimportant and of no consequence. It is my condition that we should day and night unceasingly enjoy Her overflowing grace, devote and dedicate ourselves to Her, regularly offer the puja to Her photo with all the protocols and be extremely humble in Her presence. Please correct me if you find me failing in these. This is from Sahastrara. Alright now the last round. Now you can sit down. The bride will sit on the left hand side.

Now bride and bridegroom stay together. I shall open the path of boksha which I have got with the blessings and grace of Her Holiness Sri Mataji, also to others and shall achieve in the company of such great and realized persons the well-being of whole universe. Now the havan has to be concluded. So now the bridegroom should put ghee into the havan three times. The bride should touch his hand. I am reading it now. Om Agnaye Swaha, Om Tat Sat, Om Puram Ada Puram Idam, Purat Puram Ada Chate, Purasya Puram Adaya Purameva Vashishate, Om Shanti Shanti Shanti. Now you are married. Bholo Jagannath Mataji Nirmala Devi Ki.

So on behalf of all the Sahaja Yogis of the world, heartiest congratulations to the newlyweds. Long life in Sahaja Yoga, lots of children and worshipping Sri Mataji always. And one special applause for Yogi, Lauda. The microphones for the Shainai. When you come for the blessings of Shrimadaji, you will come according to the number allotted to you. Mr. Mani Pranam, please come to the stage. Mr. S. Govind to meet Yogi. The newlyweds have received a silver present. Somebody has dropped this out of that present. This can be collected. All the newlyweds should sit down and all the rest of you should also. There's still more ceremony has to be there. Will you please all be seated? Allow the newlyweds to be seated now. Keep some space among the lines so I can bring you food. Have only two lines please.

These are supposed to be after marriage rituals, which are very sweet. We have many of them, but we try to follow some of them. They are giving Me a Ganesha with a promise that all marriages must work out very well. So now you are... So with this promise I am taking this, no doubt, but you have to keep My promise.

Now I don't know how many people have had their dinner here. The rest of the people have had their dinner or not? No? See there was a music program after this. We have been talking to these people for a while. Now would you like to have your dinner or not? I don't know if they can serve you here, it's very difficult. But some of you can go and have dinner and then some of the rest of them can go. The music will be going on. All right? Some of you can go and have food and come back and the music will be on them. But the needy vets will have some music, one or two others that's all, tomorrow morning. All right, may God bless you. Today somehow I feel that we are very good couples somehow. I have a free day. And also this is a nice way of making you poets because this is the moment when you touch your emotions. At this time if you really try to locate you might find out that inspiration within you which can make you poets. May God bless you all.

Kolkata Madras in Delhi, Ujna, we've got sarees here. So those who are in charge please come and take the sarees. Thank you. No, you cannot untie. The bridesmaid have to do it. Actually you have to trade something to the bridesmaid but they must be sleeping now.

I'm sorry we could not arrange a program otherwise because we did not know they would be coming. So I hope they don't mind they have to sit now and achieve their program. And I have been feeling that we could not really have a program at a proper time but as you see in Sahaja Yoga if something doesn't work out it works out, otherwise sometimes you don't need to accept every sort of thing. But you know these people have dedicated themselves to Sahaja Yoga and have done so much work. They have gone all over the world to straight Sahaja Yoga, I'm very thankful to them. The problem was that I just couldn't manage it because of the change, Sahaja Yoga change that and they just came I was surprised also that they could come but by that time they had all hoped for things. So I hope maybe it's you that's working.

On behalf of the Nirmal Sahaja Sehita may I thank Shri Mataji for this honor of singing exclusively for the newlywed so that it becomes quite interesting for us to sing for the newlywed because we have to keep you entertained and awake. I hope you will be entertained by our music. This is a song dedicated to the newlywed. It says about how the dream of Shri Mataji has come true that all the newlyweds have assembled here and have given a true shape to her dream of having a sahaja bird. This is dedicated to you.

Now, we have a song from Sunday. The song which we are going to render is a song about this casualty arising out of love. Out of condemnation of being in love. Out of condemnation of being in sahaja. You are totally condemned by Shri Mataji to love each other. You are totally condemned to be married perpetually. You are condemned to be in eternal love. This song is dedicated for that. It means that there is no escape from the all-pervading power, all-pervading love of Shri Mataji. And according to Greedo, this is the 1991 hit song. Though you are married, there will be no restriction on your dancing, I assure you. And it will delight you, Mataji, if you dance in your beautiful marriage dress. This song is meant for dancing. I hope you will enjoy dancing. May I request Guruji to start this song?

Mark Menn, this entertainment, this atmosphere, and presenting Asmara from Sydney. She has come all the way from Sydney to learn Indian style of boiling from Guruji. She is presently going to present to you the Western style on the world. Thank you. It's right here. If you want to do it, we are about to play Mendelssohn's Ballet Concerto in Turkey, without the orchestra, so you have to imagine that. It's very romantic. I see, Mother, I think I've got no blessing. Mother, it was Her birthday three days ago.

So to continue this program further, may I ask Vipak Varma to render this one song? I am of the state of Jhana. My family is in the background of Jhana. I have two children. They are of the state of Jhana. how people accumulate enormous wealth. And having accumulated the wealth, they leave the wealth behind when they die. Because that wealth is of no value in the kingdom of the divine. So, on the one side they are wasting their energy collecting the wealth which is of no value with the divine. And they cannot carry this wealth into the divinity. So, they are wasting their life here pursuing an item which cannot be taken into the divinity. Instead of that if they are pursuing love, if they are pursuing benevolence, if they are pursuing all goodness which Mataji teaches us, all those qualities can go with you, with your soul to the divine, to the divinity. This is the theme of the song. It is set to tune in a very like a folk song. Come on. Blankets have been given which means we have a blanket authority for keeping you awake.

Now we are rendering a very strongly appreciated, very emotional song which has always invoked the blessings of Shri Mataji and which has always created a lot of vibrations and I am sure it is going to happen now. The song is Nirmala Kithi Varnavi Kithi. There are more blankets. The blankets have an inherent warmness coupled with the warmness of Shri Mataji I am sure. You must be feeling very warm. Yes, they are becoming doubly warm. Shri Mataji, it is so relevant because Christ had the title of a shepherd and you are breaking shepherds out of her Shri Mataji. Rajesh, I think I will request you to come on the stage. You belong. Give a big clap for Rajesh. I may tell you that Rajesh has gone so keen on music and that he has started inviting Baba Mama to his house to teach music. That is the height of his interest in music, not his hospitality. He feels so strong that two world leaders are backing us. Third one is in the front. You call him also very good singer. Yes, could we have the third world leader? Because the fourth world leader I am told is in deep meditation. Can I have the third world leader behind us? One request though, in this clapping as has been taught by Shri Mataji three times is very necessary. Even when the temple goes up, you will see how the Kundalini rises and how you are so deeply involved in the Bible-free environment. You will be so totally elevated. You will feel you are in heaven, which you are of course. One, two, three.

Vishwa Vanditaa Nirmala Mata Sarat Nithaam.

So nobody should think they are individuals separated by any such small nonsensical thing. We are all one living in the ocean of God's love. Let us all take it in our heart and tell everyone that we have enjoyed that ocean and let all of you enjoy and forget all these differences which were never created. No saint has created, no incarnation has created, but human beings have misused them. All this should go all around the world, resulting, the whole world should sing the praise of God and also the whole human beings' problems must be solved. It's very easy to solve their problems, only we need the transformation. We all have power to transform, to cure, to give all the comfort and counsel them. All the powers that I have are for you. I want you to have more powers than me and I hope one day that will come to enjoy all these things. Today I am really enjoying everything, all these marriages and after that all this oneness of our ecstasy. May God bless you all.

Can you? Hundred and eight. Please write it now, his name on a piece of paper. Good, she's all right. I'm going to give you a little bit of a question. All right. You are very much cleared out. All right? But in that thing, did I say something about TM? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. But in that thing, did I say something about TM? In that lecture when this fellow was there, did I say something about TM? After? He left. Because you asked Me some question about it or something. Another question? He had gone by then. What did he say? What did he say? Is it? If he goes to him. Then what did he say? He was on the defensive? Yes. No, no, no, no. So what did he say? She was kind of 50-50 at that stage because she could feel the warm and everything. But she was a bit of a wandering person at the end of that. But I didn't realize at the time but I caught on that he was going to, you know, he was looking more than coming to get realization. So he just wanted to see what this was. But it didn't seem like that. But to me it didn't seem very fascinating at first. It seemed like an orphan. He's nothing. He's been a whole lad. Now what I'm saying that he was flickering his eyes. He wasn't flickering very much. You told him. But the Kundalini has come up. Yes, Kundalini has come up. Now you can read your mind. Very good. Put some music at it. I'll give it to you. Just follow. Ahh, you're all right. You may be relaxed. He just said this is left for the channel. It's because of the celibacy. Isn't it? And that affects the... I'm sorry. Come here. What about the husband? Well, I think there's no reason because he was really lucky. I think he was fine. Because of the very lucky one. But he was not even in his channel. He was very confident. He knew he was in the channel. He was a very good man. He was very focused. It's a really you are willing to. But long she told me, she told me that, Mother, if you come, if these people will change their idea. And, ah, the Brahman and the Saraswami, Ahh, You see? Shankaracharya? Why do you not read Shankaracharya? I mean but it's very abstract way of saying things. These are such funny, you see, bombastic things the way they talk. Have you got any certificate from his guru even? I don't think his guru ever said that he's my disciple. I'm sure of it. Is there any certificate from his guru? How does he say he was his guru even Shankaracharya? You either believe or you're distant. You either believe or you're distant. If you're told it, you don't want to accept it. Another thing I consider you, that if he thought he was the direct link, he should have been appointed Shankaracharya? Imagine, imagine what is, what is Shankaracharya? What is all this? But you don't read Shri Shankaracharya at all. He doesn't give you books to read about other things. It's like a lot of, it's like a lot of, ah, movements. You're not encouraged to read outside. You're not encouraged to explore outside the confines of the teacher. It goes to a lot of them. You see, when you start reading outside it, you finish up here. So you only read whatever is in, whatever they teach. You're only encouraged to, yes. As I say, you can read outside it. It's very good. Arjuna. So what do they teach then? I mean, they don't allow you to read any other thing. Then what do they teach you? The movement is about the reading. What is the technique? Still I don't understand. They give you just a mantra. All possibilities. Source of thought, the source of creative intelligence. Source of everything. But if you, if he is saying Shankaracharya, he never believed in thought. Well, it's beyond thought, you see, the transcendence. Where your mantra takes you is beyond thought. It's still the source of thought. But the mind is the source of thought. Yes. You're going to be very sourceful. The first little speck of thought appears. It blossoms into the thought at the gross level. All right then. So you're diving, you're transcending it. All right then. It's the old, the old Indian philosophic adage of the calf dipped in dye, fly in the sun, bleached, dipped again, fly till the colors fast and very bright. And that is the experience of transcending through your lips. Very funny. The very thing, what they do is this thing. You have this mantra and you go play the mantra and whatever it is. You keep on saying it in your mind. And then after the time you're through with thought. Mantra jam. And then you're going to, I think you're going to do this type of conscious film. My head always just starts going like this. And I'm looking at it. You wake up drinking. And then I do sleep. And I used to have lots of people. And that's good, it's only worth stressing. No, I need my nucleolus. What they used to say was, every time I... Actually really you are all bad people. Because you are. How could you listen to such a non-censor talk? See. Well it was the promise of release from the bondage of the relative. Of what? Release from the bondage of the relative existence. The attachment to material things. If you're a seeker you're... Just blah blah. You see because he says that he's taking you out of bondage of materialism. How? By loosening your grip with him. You see his opinion of renunciation is not tapas. It's meditation because when you transcend and reach the thoughtless awareness state. That is your renunciation because you're no longer in touch with the relative. You're renounced. But do you reach thoughtless awareness? I can't remember. I don't know. That's it. And then they would say like others... A lot of people claim that. Does he say also that you must have committed sins? That's why you cannot do it. You have to do it more, does he can go? He said so. You should ask him if you have to bear our karma. You have to be aware of the holders of the knowledge now. But often you know they reach problems as with girls for example. For myself I mean I was suicidal a year ago. Nobody could help me. There was no rapport among the yourself. Nobody could help me. I mean the teachers couldn't help me. Your depressions were beyond help. So this is the problem. But these teachers are paid or? They live on a stipe. They get a very small amount of living income. They don't have enough to live on. Really? So the money goes to a movement. First of all they never kept anything open for you. They closed you completely. By putting an awe about it. Not to ask if you are not a believer, if you are not a preacher. The first thing they did is to cut you from all the other schools. Because they knew that they would be found out. So they just kept you out and started talking late. You see which was too heavy for you already. You thought what's the effect of going to other courses. Because that you may not be able to learn. As I say by not encouraging. They develop the blink effect and also people fear. There is a lot of fear involved. A lot of people want to become teachers. It's very expensive. It costs about 6,000 pounds to become a TM teacher. It takes about 9 months. And a lot of people live in fear. For example for me to have come to your meeting on Thursday. And to have been seen. That would have destroyed my chances of becoming a teacher. To be seen? To be seen. Even looking casually at other movements. I didn't understand this one. If anybody is talking there from the TM. In the TM I saw that he is going to another spiritual group. That would be the end. I wouldn't be allowed into the movement. All I knew was to enter into that. You know you have committed the cardinal sin of looking. Searching somewhere else. So there is an awful lot of fear you see. People are worried. A friend of mine went to the sign people. And I too would be. And she was told that that was her chance to become a teacher. So people didn't fear. Is that so in Sahaja Yoga also? If you go to other gurus you catch them. But apart from that you are free. You are free to go. You see the thing is so similar I am just trying to see. But what is the subtle point? You are free to go to anyone. But if you catch then I'll have to clear it out. That's all. But you do catch and you yourself feel bad. That's it. It's absolutely free. I mean nobody can. I thought he was better. So the first exception is that it is not the Shankar tradition.

The things that were going to happen. Yes, because you are in the supracontics, the future. He knows from the future, you see, where spirits come and tell you. Yes, and he knew that things, what was going to happen, by those things happening, he would then be able to manipulate things. He's given a lot of power in that. Yes, an open power. You see, this is the power of the spirits coming out of him, that he doesn't know. The same spirits will eat him out, bone by bone, just like that. He doesn't know what he's done. He's not going to be perfect. He's not going to be perfect. All of them he is, how they did that. They've got some possible. Because I don't think he realizes, he's lost that realization to realize the possibility. You see, something like if he's going to arise, then absolutely, that's the advantage. That's a very big advantage that anything that has to be applied, goes into it, gets easy, and then you just do not get into the problem yourself. You just don't understand anything. That's your sign. According to the power of the spirit, no guru, no teacher can be either involved in fame, women, or money. You cannot be involved. Yes, sex one I'm talking about, cannot be involved. Any person. Of course not. You see, how can. You see, actually, I mean, if you want, I was reading them off the, you see, you get detached in the sense you become the personality. You are a detached personality. You don't know what strength is. You don't know what strength is. It comes to, you see, you may become famous in a different point, but you don't know what is feeling. Just don't care, you know. You just don't care. The person who is true to you also understands you. But the one who is realized, the one who is going to work is the guru. He's the one who just doesn't care for you. They are coming to see you. I'll give you an example. I won't go back to that. There was one very rich man who was doing a, his sister was from the council, he was working with the hospital and all that. But he was, he was very much interested in the development of the language. He knew and he must help me in more, but he had really so much money that he had an actual vision. He said, you know, I have a question. You talked to this, my best teacher, she said, no problem. I'm talking about it. I don't understand much about it. He said, no, I will do this and he went to talk to this gentleman and he said, this is my mother. He spoke, I would like to have a look at her. One thought, he said, how can you actually accept these things? I tried to put it there. See, they've got problems. So he said that my wife is a person, she's possessed, she's got cancer and she's such a such and I want to have a look at her. And if she says that, yes, it is like that, my wife, then I can have the ruse and I can have the ruse, I get lot of money myself. But just now we are, there are all these problems are there. You see, he somehow or other tried to make these concerns, he went to work. So very seriously, she said, you might be interested in me and she's worried about me if she's going to survive. I said, I don't want to survive. But the rest of the time I said, what if she's right? So the, she, she, she was very serious, very serious, extremely serious. And she was herself opined, she came on a plane and she went down there and she was like, you know, such a big, not that Mark was bad, no, he was also a good person. But some dirty women must have come in between, you see, and you all have such funny ideas, you must change your wives, like, like American people have, you must change your fridge and you must change your, you must change your wives. The change is the sign according to them of progress or whatever it is. So I think something like that maybe, but it was very serious allegation about her, you see. She was such a fine person. So, and then she, she went off to the bathroom, came to the scene and he said, Mother, what do you think about her? I said, she's one of the finest American women and she's a very devoted wife and don't go near them, they have a power of their own and I will not touch her by anything. And also he said, Mother, do you think she's, she's not possessed? I said, not at all, you may be, but she's not. And he said, what about, what about cancer? I said, she thought, and there's no possibility of her getting into it. She's a very devoted wife, she's a very nice person and she loves you. And if you try to have a divorce with her, you'll be a very miserable person, just don't do it. It's not at all good for you. As a Mother I'm telling you that if she's My daughter and I'm proud of her. Oh, his face fell down. So I said, see. Then Mother Chandubhai said, Mother, you have no pragmatic approach. I said, what pragmatic approach? I said, I don't understand the word. He said, you should be practical. I said, what practical? They said that to see these women. Why don't you say that? I said, but I said, how come it's a good thing, right? I said, Chandubhai, do you know if there's an innocent person? And if you brand an innocent person like this, you know, live alone Me, I would never do that. But even if you do that, it's a very great sin which you cannot fill up by giving Realisation to even one-handed people. Shook on the floor. I said, is that the man you love to be? I said, yes. Now will you do it? She said, no, no, no, I'm out of it. You see, after all an Indian man. He said, no, no, no, I'm out of it. We are going out. He said, Mark, don't talk to Me. I'm going out. If she is the woman like that, what Mother here said, I'm the woman. And like that, you see, the whole difference is out. Doesn't matter now. What are we going to do with these buildings? I have to have human beings. You have a human being. The temples are to be built of human beings and not of these houses which are built to crumble the house. You see, we have to keep living our images to the point. Not these things by which people are impressed for the time being and then when they say that they never take their own. You see, such a person cannot. You see, he just does not work. Same about fame. You see, what is fame? Is nonsense. What is a fame? What is a fame? Just tell Me. I do never understand. You understand? What is fame is what is it, you see. Fame, if it means somebody says, oh, you're great, you're great. Run away from that place. Because, you see, they may be wanting something out of you. They want to use you. Normally, none of the Incarnation got fame and they got only stones and just stitches. None of them got it. But there's only one way Sahaja Yoga is going to do that. Because you're going to get actualization. You're going to get the experience of it. That's why in your heart God is going to decide anyway. This is the way. If you call it this way, I accept that it should be so. If that sort of a fame is that you feel that now, you see that, there is a need for the person. Is the fame which comes out of auspiciousness. You know auspiciousness is a thing by, is a quality, a personality by which you improve in your being, in your everything. You get success, not this worldly success but success that is satisfying. Shri means grace that is beautifying. Such a person is auspicious and such a person will have a kind of a fame which is very different from Indian style. And the world is going to change you see. They are not going to have Lord by the emperor's statue. No they're not. Or Wellington is not going to be there to drop. We are going to have something else. People are going to change these. Awareness is going to change completely. They are going to care for people who have that eternal essential in them. They are not going to. I think when we are all talking about this whole world, we don't understand I think one thing that the sin against the Holy Spirit is the worst and all the worst of the sin. She is very simple to understand. Supposing somebody beats you, you won't mind. If somebody beats me, will you be able to do ten acres in your heart? The same way Christ has said, it's all right if you insult Me but if you insult My mother, I am going to be right on your throats. There are eleven powers you have got by which you say to Him. It's all such people. It's very simple to understand. You have to insult the Mother of Christ. It's very dangerous. That's why He never told anybody that She was the Holy Spirit. She was the Holy Ghost. That's why He didn't say because that was a protective thing. She was. Ask a question. Maria, are you busy on the cocaine? I'm just finished. Why is it so simple? It's working so hard. Will you please go on? It's very logical, isn't it? It's very logical. I mean if He's your Son and if He's the Son of God then He wants to be God. I wonder why people don't see that, you know. See, that's the trouble. They can see something, you cannot see. This is My hand. This is the ring. You see something which does not exist and you do not see that exists. This illusion. It's the illusion. If you can get, you see, into that state, from where you see the illusion, you just enjoy the people. Oh, the illusion. Oh, you see. Just now as you are laughing at yourself just now, see when the illusion is over, you are like, oh. Yes, yes, yes. Isn't it? It's a big joke. You know, I was also there. I was out there. Yes, but this is hard. This is hard. This is how the whole of Maya acts. Yes, well, see. Because till you got beyond that way you were able to... I do agree, I agree. I do not blame you for that at all. You see, you are the crucified ones. How? How to expose them? You see, this is the trick of the Maya, if you understand. It's the flame, it's the tower. See, now you cannot kill them like that, see, because they have entered into your head, you see. So now how do I do it? Is to put you there. Yes. You go into there, you see them and then you get out of it. Yes. And it would be with a greater force and with greater immunity from these horrible people. Yes. You know, Mahathri said something very funny when we were in September when we were there. He was talking about a story from one of the prasas about the Brahmin who had rice and he went to this king's palace and on his way out he stole some jewellery and they couldn't understand why he stole the jewellery. He was the saint and he stole his jewellery. They discovered eventually, you know, the food that he had eaten came from the village of thieves. He returned the jewellery by then, you see. What about him doing the same? Yes, and then he said, he said the story looking at Me, you see, and afterwards he walked out because we had just about two hours before been discussing this question of the money they owe us, you see, what they've done. And he said to me as he walked out, you see, and it was only four months later that I actually saw what he was getting at. He was apologising for his own deeds and he then said, He was a thief. People in this room were going to bring down the movement. No, no, you see, he was incapable of apologising. Not that way but he was trying to prove to say these things and all that, just to show him impress you that I know what you are talking about. He is a thief and a dirty fellow. I mean, I have no dictionary. I don't understand what to say, you see, I have no words to say what sort of a man he is. You should really get somebody from Lucknow. These are nice abusers that they use for such people, you see. If you want I can write to someone, write about twenty one of them. You send him back, this is this, this is this you are. And this is the mantra you say about yourself that I am his, I am his, I am his. So, eventually. He is always playing with his mother. I will tell you, you cannot imagine what sort of a man he is. We had one like that, but openly he was like that. You see, once we had a very great swindler in India, a great swindler. His name was Dharamtajya. I don't know where he learned that swindling but he met Jawaharlal Rajiv in Tamil Nadu. And in these matters our Prime Minister was very nice. He was very fond of people who were properly impressed in a very, you see, English manner. And they spoke good English and they had all the English. I mean he was, he was very well, you see, you cannot imagine. We should say, supa for supa or something like that. So that kind of a thing our Prime Minister was very much impressed with. So this fellow went and told him that I am doctor, I am this, God, English and all. And also our Prime Minister, they say so or not, I don't know, but that he had enough. He could appreciate a good looking woman very much. So his wife was a very good looking woman, as they say, I don't know, I've seen her. I've seen this horrible fellow. And he managed him somehow and then when he went back to India. That time I'm telling you that I had gone to see my husband right there. And you know for us they are allowed to sit inside the lounge and sleep out. And I saw this man with a big hand, overhand, so I took ask my husband, he said, He said, why do you want to know? I said, but you tell me who is this man. He said, why he is so childish today? I said, I'm not childish, I'm anxious to see who is there. So he said, all right, I'll tell him his name, his name is Dharamtich. And I said, what is he doing there? He said, why do you want to know about him? Of all the persons why he? I said, because he's going to give you talk. Really? He said, I'll tell him. He said, God! I said, what? Is he connected with him? He said, very much. I said, how? He's coming for shipping. So then you know what happened that this fellow went to to Harlachi and wife would have a breakfast with him and she used to order a bar and this and that. And you know Jawaharlal Ji was another, as I told you, very nice person. He never understood that this fellow is a good person. Then he was given from that poor country, it was 20, 1965, crores of business to build a machine. But my husband as soon as his proposal came up he put down his book because I was after his life. So they transferred him and they gave him a bigger post and they said he become chairman of shipping corporation, let's transfer him. And they gave him 65 lakhs of rupees and the parliament passed it in our re-prime minister also was in a 65 crores of rupees were passed to this fellow. And then he bought ships and so called ships and he cheated all the big, big sort of shipyard and all that, never paid them any money. He ordered the ships, he took the delivery and every time he took prime minister there to another, another deputy prime minister who is nowadays our prime minister, the great fellow you see, the one who drinks the English. Desai. Desai, Desai. You see we have lots of bhajans you know what I mean. He took the him there and this fellow, this Desai was the one who inaugurated and big this thing and naturally you see the poor shipyard people, this Hitachi and all these people who built ships on him couldn't say anything because the prime minister, the deputy prime minister coming in Garland and these that and he's going to launch the ship. They launched the ship and this fellow never gave them no money. The ship was launched by Mananthe, you see from there and they had no way of collecting anything and these are the two great people of our country can imagine, the one who is today the prime minister and the one who was and they gave him sixty five crores of it. Now, My, this happened and then suddenly the whole thing started coming up, just like this you see and then one man he found it out and he leaked it to the government and he leaked it to the police and all that and then suddenly my husband was in, let me see, he was in Japan and he suddenly came home. I said, how just a terrible thing that's happening there. I said, what? Then they told me that this man was supposed to have killed his first wife and took her money and then come to India and did this and that and that and that and people are after him and because of this thing it started off, you see they found out also that he was shipping and these two great giants of our country, what should I call them, you see, they were saying, you see, don't harass them. The police is very bad, don't harass them again. They were supporting him all the time, these two people. But they were simple, they didn't take any money from him, My son, but then this man was upset with God and then he one day just ran away from India to some place in the Panama from where we could not have any explanation. The whole thing was hashed out and all the ships were frozen, all his money was frozen and still he managed to take away, there's a fourth karatsa for peace out of the land. But this, the best part of it, my husband says very seriously to me, that do you know that two hundred and fifty rupees that you have to pay for registration, that also this thug did not pay. Even that he did not pay and our great people like Jawaharlal Nehru and Murad Jai were greatest supporters of him. So you shouldn't feel bad about what has happened. You see, it is fair. And then he was arrested, he was extracted, he came to London, London was like, he entered and the case was filed in London and he was telling stories after stories. Jawaharlal Nehru had died by that, you see, he became upset with God and he died in the holiday country, in old age he got a shock on his life, but he did such a foolish man. See, we are talking, you see. If you see his old age photography looks like a dazed person, you see. And then this case started in London and then he said, another drama he played, he said, you see, these people are all against Jawaharlal Nehru, to take bad name, to give their all this blame and this and that. And the judge was listening to him and he said that. And the judge said, now, I have finished. He said, now I say that you are a crook of the first waters and you are a thug and you are this and you are that and now will you shut up. That's what they said and he missed it. I said, that's the way you should be said. And he said, you take two running jumps and go to heaven. These are the words he used. And then he was in jail, he came out of jail and then Indira Gandhi the great, you see, another great lady we had, Prime Minister, she saw to him that he goes out of prison. Now he's out. So are we not sufficiently rooted? Do you want more examples? Just see, it's a fact, it's a fact, you see. So imagine people like that and the, and I would not even blame Jawaharlal Nehru for this because he had such a big secretariat with the best, the cream of our country, the most intelligent people, big. All the intelligent she of India was behind this and they all did it in good faith, you see, the good faith about it. And none of them got a single pie. Hello, how are you? Yes, yes, yes, yes. Very nice children they are. Come along, come along, come along. I've been just waiting for you to come down here. Come along, come along. Sit down. Sit down, sit down. Good. See, the force has come. See, vibrations, you just see the vibrations. All of them are, see. How beautiful, all of them are realized. Just look at this child. Beautiful they are. Can you remove this, then they can sit comfortably. This may be the, just stop them now. Look at them. Maria, who are they? Good. You said there would be only ten people. Maria, you said there would be only ten people. It's good and the great people have come. You see, these are great people. What's your name? What's your name? We must tell you your name. What's your name? Just see the eyes, it's following you. It's beautiful. Beautiful they are. Aren't they? Just put your hands like this. Let's see if you feel the cool breeze. All right? Just like this. This is for born relaxed. All relaxed. This peak in it. What language this peak? Gujras. Gundaatli. Tandu Aviche? All of them. This is a wonderful. Can you feel that? Those moments. Tremendous. They have brought the post for you. Hello. Hello. May God bless you. Please come. Please come. See them. I mean this is what it is. Can you see? Can you feel them? Can you feel the vibrations? Vallaja Seer is great. They'll do the job for Me. I don't have to say. Just put your hands also like this. All of you. Just like this. It's so simple. See now? You feel some cool in the hand? Yes, cool. Are you feeling all right there? All of you? Are you feeling the cool breeze? See. How are you feeling? You see? You have to be great people to be the mother of such children. They are great children and they have selected you as a mother. There must be some reason for it. You too. It's cool. Can I be opened? Yes, I can. Open that window. That window is better. You open that one. That one. It's good. How may we do now? One more. Oh, I did see a bit of a change there. There's another one born realized. Are you feeling the cool breeze? Is your father feeling the cool breeze? He feels it. Good. See? Have more of it and more of it. Let it coincide. Absolute. You have got cold. You have got cold. Beautiful. See, you have already got the high. Why should you worry? So many children are born in this country. How you find it? Better now? Feeling better? Better now? And better. And the best thing is you must know the know-how. Otherwise you are not to believe anything. Why should you believe anyone who doesn't tell you the know-how? They call it science. Do you know, do you have anything, I mean any knowledge of science about which you have, you don't have to know know-how? In Sahaja Yoga, eventually everything is there. Good. Maria's house is blessed many a times. Beautiful. Very beautiful. Come. Oh. No, what's that? Let it out. Let it spread. Now, come. Still? I'll put you in this cup. Now put. Why don't you sit down, Balaji? See, if the chair people can go back, see, then others can sit in between. Now all those who are occupying chairs should go to the back. Better idea? So that those who can sit in front, you see. It is so far could be cushioned a little bit, this side. Hello. Hello. Come along. We have had a very nice session of great laughter, you see. Something like talking about Charlie Chaplin. Hopefully he's got my love. Yes? Hopefully he's got my love. Yes. This is the same. I think you should put these chairs down at the back so that they can see. Can you sit down? You are all right. Just sit down. Here. Just come in. Did you, did you turn up? Hello. Hello. Hello. I'm not seeing anything. Just come home. Just come. We have been having a big laughter. Well, it's very good. Yes, it is. Did she turn up? Yes, she's upstairs. We just brought his wife. My love. This is your daughter. I can't think. She's here. But she's going to recognize root in the photograph. She's doing this with her glasses. Come, come, come. The train from Glasgow is late. Yes. I'm sorry it's too late. All right. You're never late with me. Can you sit on the ground? Oh yes. Very much so. So all the quorum is complete? All of them? They are people from... They, they, they have brought the real force, you see, all of them. Yes, they have brought the real force. Just sit like this. Just like this. Do not follow. Are you feeling the cool breeze? Yes. Good. You've got it already. See, it's so simple. What about you? See? All right, just wash my hands. Just see that. Just see. What about you? Are you feeling the cool breeze? Not yet? Just now you will know if it is there. No, no sort of... You feel everything? No. We've been just laughing about all the things here now, the training and how they have cheated all of us and all that. Oh God! And now we know, and now we have to decide and plan out how we are going to outfit all of them. So it's a plan we have to work it out. Good. Just be sitting down. It's beautiful. It has to be settled down also. An experience which is to be settled down. The Kundalini rises at the first shot, missed. There is no basic problem. I mean, I would say that as I have told you before that I couldn't give the elevation to the ten percent similarity. So, we are foreigners to the region. There is something special about you that your own motherland is giving you that power and all that. And it is spontaneous, it is very forceful and it does happen but then it settles back. In the sense it has to look after all the centers and all the problems that you've had. So it comes down. When you start thinking about it, that's the point, the very good point. You cannot think about it. You didn't get it by thinking. This one thing you must have known that you did not get it by thinking. You got it because it was too happy to you. So if you think about you will reach nowhere. You cannot think about it. It is love. What can you think about love? It's not science. And just now if you watch your eyes, watch yourself, you are beyond us, most of you are. It's new thought. Why? You've done it. Are you too close to them? You find it too hot? You can put it off I think. Just a light is it? Are you feeling the cool breeze lightly? Good. So let's talk of something nice now. Let's talk about the light. You talked about the masala. I was going to bring her because she is being initiated into the family. But I couldn't because I was very smart. But perhaps you can talk about it. They are not very new but she is about a year older now. That one is beautiful. What did you say? She has TML. She is pretty. She is about a year older. That was the last daughter. She has got Rama's mantra. Yes, she has got it. Rama's mantra. You also can feel it. Yes, yes, yes. That's the Rama's. You see this is Rama's chakra. So I will tell you about this. Rama's chakra. So I will have to tell you about ourselves. What are we? Actually we know so little about ourselves. This ignorance is responsible for this kind of a problem that you all have faced. Because you are so ignorant about it. And the reason is the knowledge about what I am going to tell you, you can only have when you are a real person. Without that one cannot talk about it and one cannot explain to you because it is too fantastic. It is so fantastic that you cannot believe it and you cannot accept it. And that's why it is not for human mind to conceive it. It goes beyond. If I say that there is God's divine power, which is the most dynamic power, which is the only power that guides this creation, that coordinates everything, that looks after us and that has made us a human being. You won't believe it. That there is such a power of God. All that you see other things is absolutely false. It's just a reflection, is not the mirror. And this power can enter into every atom, every molecule and can control all that. We see it every day those things but we take it for granted. Like we see the flowers suddenly becoming the fruits. How do they become? A mango tree will give you mangoes. It won't give you roses. How does it happen? If you see even in chemistry, elements that are created on this earth have a regular planning about it. They are divided into exactly eight divisions. Now how all this happens? We never think about it. We take it for granted. We try to find out what we see, what it is and then we say, oh, we are great scientists. But you cannot say how it works. Even if you take a sulphur dioxide, an ordinary atom of sulphur gas. The sulphur atom is on top and there are two oxygen atoms. If you see it under microscope you can find out that it pulsates and there's a kind of a vibration that's passing between these atoms and these vibrations are of three types. Unequal, equal, dissimilar, also. And who does that? And how, why, that certain act like this, some act like that. Even the matter which is a dead thing, which we do not think is capable of having any energy in it. That's what we used to think. Now of course you have changed your ideas about that. That too has such a beautiful arrangement. Even up to the molecule state, up to the atom state you can see how it is mathematically arranged with the protons and the neutrons around us. It is just to see and wonder it. And when you see it in the nature and these elements, their atoms, then you see later on when you start watching, something much more complex, that is a living cell with the carbon coming into it. We just take it for granted. We never bother to know from where did this carbon come from and how did carbon combination life came in. We just take ourselves also for granted as if we are great kings and that whatever we have got our human life is our own, you see sort of thing. And we think that if we have this human body it's our special right to have it. Even this eye of ours if you see is such a complex camera, how it works instantaneously, how it captures. It's something beyond our comprehension, so we negate it. We don't see it. We say, all right, we take it for granted. That's the way human beings live with it. See if you cannot cope with the thing then what we do is to accept it for granted and leave it. That's a sensible thing to do. In the same way nature has made you special in such a manner that you cannot hear certain frequencies, you can only hear certain frequencies. You are created with such beautiful adaptations to nature and surroundings. This earth is moving with such a tremendous speed you do not feel. It is spinning round so fast you cannot feel. We take all this for granted and we think we are human beings. But why are you human beings? Why have you become human beings? What can you find out? What did you find out so far? Whatever you can see, whatever is absolutely factual that you have found out. You have not been able to find out why these things happen and how these things happen. How are you going to find out about such a complex thing that you are a human being? You have become a human being without doing anything about it. And what are you going to do for getting that awareness by which you are going to know yourself? Nothing. Nothing whatsoever. On the contrary effort. Human beings good because they have a sense that they can put in effort. But you reach a certain stage later on that you feel you are putting in effort, it's just working out, you are just sitting down very nicely and the whole thing is working out. Say for example, there is a relay in London about some programs in the tree. Now it's all in the atmosphere, you don't see it. And suddenly you start your tea, you get it. What effort have you put in? It was all built in there and it was all, whatever was done on the other end was also done by somebody. You have just put all the switches and you get pictures which you do not see normally on the walls nowhere but suddenly you get them, they are there existing. But you believe into it because this you have seen with your own eyes. It is an actual thing, that's why you believe into it and that's why you must believe into it when it's an actual thing. So we come to that position where we understand that if anyone talks about higher life, higher life, about power beyond this, then we must have actualization of it, we must believe it. At this point there is a problem because it is easy to talk about peace, that there is a higher life, there is God and there is His power working and all that. All this lecture you can hear from many people. Even actualization of it you see, they may say that jumping like a frog is actualization. Yes, we have had people like that. You know in one of My lectures there was a gentleman who was sitting with both his feet towards Me and I said, it's all right for Me but I don't know what's going to happen to this gentleman you see. And then one of the boys went and said, you are not supposed to sit like that, you are smaller. She said, you see I'm sorry but if I sit in any other form I cannot sit, I start jumping like a frog. So I said, how do you think that this is, this happens you see. It happens every time and if I do it now it will start like that. So I said, but why this has happened? Because My, Kundalini has a reason, I'm a self-relaxed person. Who has told you this? He took out a big book like that, you won't believe such a big book and he showed Me, written down there, that when Kundalini rises you start jumping like a frog. Who is this gentleman? This is some acharya, Brahma, some sort of a name, such a big name you see and horrible person's photograph on your face. Such a big book and this fellow is carrying on his head all the time jumping like a frog. And he says that, yes you have to jump like a frog. So I asked him, now when you are going to evolve are you going to become a frog or a monkey? What are you going to become? This is first thing. Oh, you can use your brains for this, to understand what to expect, you see. You are not going to become like monkeys or pigs or even lions. You are already the highest and you have to feel something higher. So that will sit out. Then the fellow says, another one who came to Me and he says the best was we had one from Birmingham, is it there? This is David, he is our Sahaja Yogi, he is very sweet and otherwise poor thing. He came yesterday and I said, what happened David, what were you doing like this and why did you do all these things after coming to Sahaja Yoga? He said there must be some devil on Me, a supracautious devil. But he said, Mother he was so subtle, one of the subtlest one you should understand, that he told Me that you are this and this and that you would give me realization and I should go into all this. It came in my ears and told me. Can you imagine to that extent it was? And so he believed in that kind of a spirit and he was carrying all this out. But I said for telling you this, why should you use any spirit? You can use it in time out. Use your brains. Then we have another one where we think we can purchase you see in the market, you see there are courses of yoga. Three weeks course? Three years course for shaving off all your property. So we go in you see for that. Then all such thing one must understand. Cannot be anywhere reality. So what should we expect? What should be the reality? What we call of knowledge of self. First science has given us a certain thing which we should try to understand. And if you understand through science you can understand without it. Science has given us an understanding that there is a power which we cannot comprehend through our rationality. Even a person like Einstein says that I could not find the theory of relativity in the laboratories. I was tired, I was lying down and I was playing with soap bubbles. Imagine he played with soap bubbles. And suddenly the whole theory of relativity dawned upon me because he was a realized soul. So it has not come from laboratories these people themselves are saying. So whatever knowledge has come to us has not come through so called scientific research but through the grains of some power which has been. Science cannot explain many things. For example, the science is very bad. He is not well in the world. That's why he is upset you see. All the other children are all right. They cannot say why. So many things happen in the human body. For example, it is said that any foreign body that enters in the system creates a situation by which the body tries to throw it away. But it's only the fetus which is retained in the womb, nurtured and looked after and thrown away at a time when the thing is absolutely machined. So there is somebody who thinks about it. Then there are two chemicals, chemicals there, adrenaline and acetylcholine which are secreted in our being at different points. And they cannot explain how these ordinary chemicals sometimes augment, is constrict and sometimes not at different points. They cannot explain it so they will say they are honest. So they say the mode of action of these chemicals in the human body cannot be explained. They behave differently from their own nature, so above all from their own nature. There are many such things which I can quote to you and show you that man reaches a point where he thinks that there is something else that takes the decision. Now when you reach that stage then you start thinking that through science we feel that there is something that we cannot explain and that rationality cannot take it out there. So there must be some answer to it. The answer comes from psychology. I would say Jung was one of the greatest psychologists ever. He opposed Freud because Freud you know was a horrible psychologist. He was a fellow who was treating all kinds of abnormality. He never treated normal people. So he got possessed by them, you see, and he started behaving abnormally. He himself was a very abnormal person. He had very abnormal relationships and he was really absurd, you see, his own lifetime and he had a very bad death, he had cancer, he died very bad. But still all of the western world worships him. They never see what he achieved in his own lifetime, what sort of a person he was, what was his relationship with other people and how he lived. He was very anxious, always taking pills and he died of a terrible cancer and in a very wretched condition he died. While Jung in his old age he got his realization and he was of a very different nature and when he died he used to look, he was looking like a flower. But people do not see all that. They just see what he writes and because it suits them, you listen to Freud, I don't know why it suits them, actually it should not normally. So the Mr. Freud has come out and I would say Jung if you would, you would find out that this great man has done so many experiments with thousands of people and has established that there are forces beyond us, forces beyond us which control and the forces beyond us which control us, he called them as universal unconscious. Unconscious because they are not in our consciousness and he called them as also as, you see he actually did not know how to name it. So he said that he has said it is the Mother's force, it's a motherly force, very clearly and he studied Indian also, Indian literature and all that and he has developed some thought on Shakti point also. So he has used the word Shakti for the universal unconscious. But still he was just to realize so there was no mother to tell you all about what it was. So he could only indicate and tell you that there is an universal unconscious which is guiding them. He experimented with people with their dreams. There's a very famous dream which he interpreted about a man who would always dream that he has to bow to his own son. His son is sitting on a pedestal and he has to bow to his son. Now the son might be a realized soul. So he came to him and he said, I don't know why I get such a dream. So Jung asked, what is your relationship with your son? He said, very, very bad. I said, why? He said, I am, you see his mother is dead, I'm married again and my wife is very angry with him and I really don't know what to manage, how to manage it. The relationship is gone very bad. So he said, the unconscious is telling you that you must bow to him. He means of a higher awareness so you must bow to him. It is giving you a balance. Then there was another girl who came to him with a dream. I mean to just put two dreams together actually. She said that I see my mother as a witch. So he asked the girl, what is your relationship with your mother? She said, it's very hard, very good. She actually pampered me, she has pampered me so much that I am just good for nothing. He said, that is the thing is coming to you from your unconscious to suggest that your mother is a witch who is spoiling you. And there are thousand and one like that, you see, there are so many volumes of it which you can read for yourself. So the psychologists have told us that the state of human awareness would reach at a point when he will be thoughtlessly aware. He will be aware but there won't be any thought. This is said by you who were the psychologists. So we should know what we have to expect. Now there's another source which is very clear, a very, very clear which we can understand are the scriptures. If you read Jog's Revelation you can read about it. You will know that the cool breeze is to be expected. If you read Shankaracharya of course I will not say much more because he's the one who has completely exposed the whole thing in the sixth century. This knowledge was a secret knowledge before that because the evolutionary forces had not taken its proper course. It was kept a secret knowledge, a guarded knowledge for very few. Only in the sixth century he started exposing it in Kavida, in Nanaka. All these people came out with full exposition of Kundalini. The greatest work done on Kundalini was in Maharashtra where Nathas, the nine Nathas, the primordial masters they call themselves, worked on it. And also in other places they also came from Punjab. There was a big rapport between Punjab and Maharashtra and they went into the forest, meditated and religiously tried to find out what was Kundalini, what was the force, what was the seed within us, what was the germinating force that is going to give us this. Because one or two were realized whenever they talked about realization, nobody could believe them and could understand that there is a force like that. And they said, oh these people, we are happy with ourselves. Moreover the people who were realized had such bad experiences of all these people like they were beaten up, crucified, they were poisoned. I mean imagine the people. What was there to crucify Christ? I still can't understand. So the very sensible people of this world looked at all these explanations about God and divinities with that kind of a hostile attitude. And there was no way of changing this attitude of this world. And this hostility was expressed even by religious organization. You see anybody who was a realized soul was thrown away from churches, from temples. These Brahmins killed them, they tortured them. The last one that we had was the Shirdi Sai. And if you see how the Brahmins from Nagar area, from Ahmed Brahman, how they tortured him you'll be surprised. Not only that but they brought a snake charmer with a snake to kill. But he caught hold of the snake and he dropped the snake. Since the snake went away and bit the charmer. Then he was the one who got up and saved the charmer. And he told him, don't do all this. He said, I would not put people, these Brahmins have given me money. So the people who were supposed to be in charge of religion themselves crucified those saints who talked of reality. And that's how reality was completely lighted. Nobody could see it and people were gagged. This was the problem. And that's why somebody had to come and do this to give a mass realization to people. So that it becomes a common knowledge. Everything that is discovered by one person has to become the common knowledge otherwise it has no meaning. Even in the science you see, you find out about electricity. It has a big history behind it, whatever it is. But at a point it has to become a common knowledge. If it is not a common knowledge it will never be accepted and it has no value at all. It has to become a knowledge of every human being otherwise it has no meaning. And the time has come for you to have the actualization and to have the complete knowledge of your being. What you are, what you are going to be, what you could have been, what are the problems around you. So in us is placed the germinating force. We are all built in it. It's like a computer. Absolutely living computer within us is placed through our evolution. One by one, step by step. All these points have been properly put down in our back room, in our brain and in the limbic area here. Absolutely in a possible manner. And only thing that one has to do is to surrender to accept it. But we'll surrender to all kinds of nonsensical things but to the right person our ego will immediately stand up and say. If somebody has two hands it is very easy to surrender. Or if somebody is very cunning very easy to surrender. But where do you surrender? Is to the Divine force, to yourself, to your wisdom. What do you surrender? Is your nonsensical idiotic ego. What do you have to surrender to God? What do you have? Only this non-knowledge which has come to you through ego or sometimes through these possessions which is the super. Now for surrendering people think, how can I surrender? Now you cannot think about it. How should I surrender? Can you work it out on a paper? I will do this, X plus X is equal to so much. It's very simple. How do you laugh? Do you sit down and make a picture? Now I'm going to laugh my child so I will make a laugh with this much angle and this much angle and the baby there at this angle, look at her with this angle. Then I'll turn left, right and then I'll put the child this side. Do you do like that? You know how to laugh, don't you? It's belting. Surrendering is nothing but is the love of God that is within you. He is within you in your heart. He's there. All the scriptures have said that and none of them are wrong or false. They might have been misinterpreted somewhere, everybody has their tricks you see. Our tantrikas in India, all these who are nowadays gurus, our tantrikas once upon a time in the sixth century, they entered into all kinds of things and the worst thing they entered into are the Vedas themselves you see where they declared that even a thing like Ashwami Yidiyadhya which is a very pure thing is also oriented from sex. Even they said that the God and the Goddess, God and His power are sex relationships. Actually they think human beings are nothing but sex points. They have nothing else in them. Even an amoeba has something more than that. But we accept them. Why? Because we are seekers. We are simple and we are simple. We are born in this world to seek. We have taken our birth specially at this time to seek. We have been seekers all our lives and today we want to seek and how are we going to seek? Wherever we get a chance we hunt to. I know it is hard to understand that you don't have to do anything, just sit right. The boat is moving and it will take you to the other side. You don't have to do anything else. It was going to work out, isn't it? The whole tree has to match. Now the flowers are there, they attract the bees. The bees come at the right time, they blossom at the right time and also the fruits appear at the right time. It has to match. It has to take its whole course and time. The way you are building, the way you are made, it has to complete itself. So the another round starts and that's why this hurrying up has to seem to come. That's all. Nothing more than that. And it is very easy to correct yourself. There's no problem about it. It's very easy because once you have like you know you start seeing everything very very clearly. Because there is no light it becomes so difficult. Have you tried climbing up steps without lights in a new house which you have no way? These times you fall down before you get over one light. But if there is light, whatever type of the house may be, wherever you have been you can just go up there and just like that. In the same way unless and until you have enlightened, unless and until you have realized, unless and until you have that power flowing through you, you cannot understand and you cannot see that how simple it is. And you are so beautifully built in your previous searches that once you get this awakening within you, you start awakening the rest. Immediately and you can start it on somebody else. But you see just now it's such a powerful thing that most of them have got it. So I don't know where I'm going to find it. Just the problem is. Most of them have got it. You see sometimes it happens like that. So who are we going to raise now Mother? Everybody's realizing. You can do something. You can do something. She's got it too. You see that's the problem. That it is so powerful but you'll find that it is setting down again. It has to go back because we have got chakras within us, the centers which are being exhausted. Like I would say now this side is the left side and this is the right side and both sides are the sympathetic nervous system. The right side sympathetic nervous system works for your mental being and for emotional being, mental being and for your physical being and the left side for your emotional being. In between is the central part, is the parasympathetic. Now the underlying subtle energies that control these two left and right. The left one is controlled by the power which we call as Mahakali's power which is I. Then the rim and the cleave you see. The rim is the central power, Ra. Ra is energy. Rim is the one which gives you evolutionary powers and also sustenance. Like carbon has its own sustenance and like gold has its own sustenance as you have your own sustenance. Everybody has the sustenance through this central power of rim is the power of Mahayana Sahaja Yoga and the right hand side power is the power of Mahasaya Sahaja Yoga. Now you shouldn't get upset with this Sanskrit name. It has nothing to do with any particular community or anything because these were found out by saints who were meditating in India and they knew Sanskrit language. That's why there are Sanskrit names. Moreover these names also. Science you see has developed here but also in India a kind of a science developed and the science that was developed in India was in the science of Kundalini. Is the force of the germinating power, the residual power within us and this science has seen or has actually experimented with the movement of the Kundalini when it moves the sound it makes and these sounds are different on different centers within us which are seven basins but there are eleven otherwise and there are three, how much you think, three hundred and fifty, three hundred and fifty million. So this is the thing, three hundred and fifty million but we deal only with seven at the most with the element, not more than that because it's too much of an idea. Why should you worry? You need not worry. Now you are sitting in this room, it's all right perfectly well. Why should you worry from where this electricity has come and how many drops it must have taken to create this much of electricity. Is it from the water or from the coal or what is the history, who is bothered, you just put on the light and enjoy it? They have done it for you, it's all done. In this also you must take it for granted that it's all done for you and you have every right to have it. So this Kundalini when it passes through all these various chakras it makes a sound and that sound has been taken by those people in the ancient days as the phonetics, phonetics sounds for forming the Sanskrit language. That's why Sanskrit is used for controlling the Kundalini, the movement of the Kundalini and the centers that are within you have got a mark, a landmark of your evolution. For example the leaders who came at different stages of your evolution were actually the incarnations of Divine power and they have left a mark within you and they exist within you at that particular set. So when you say a particular mantra that deity opens up and starts emitting energy but still human being without realization is a limited energy. His deities have limited energies but if he is put in connection with all pervading power through realization then his deities are also emitting. Like if you have a car and you have a limited petrol all right and the petrol shortage is there too then you are put into tension and you do not know what to do. But supposing there is a permanent pipe on your gap of the petrol tank you see which is filling it permanently then you don't have the tension also. You are not bothered what is the exhaustion. Now this exhaustion on all these centers because these are the underlying forces of all the plexuses that we have also. When they get exhausted the plexuses that are acting our body, our mind, our thinking, our emotional activities all of them get exhausted and then we develop diseases of various types physical, mental and physical. So to make these centers awakened is a very important thing even from a day to day lifestyle. Like you must fill them up, you must awaken them so that at least your health is all right, your wealth is all right, your mind is all right and also your emotions are all right. This is the basis. But ultimately what do you get? Ultimately you get that connection which is all the time not only that much like unless and until you get this connected to the mains you cannot work it out. It may be very nicely laid what to do with it. So the first thing is put it to the mains. When you put it to the mains then only you will realize also where is the problem. Otherwise you will not know. But when you get your Self-realization you know your problems, you know yourself. This is the first thing. That is Self-realization. You know your centers, how they are affected, where they are affected, what is the problem there and you get the power to cure them. Of course thoughtless awareness is there, no doubt but plus that. Immediately a person who's Kundalini has crossed Agnya, only Agnya, may not even get realization, can cure others. That's how we have half baked curing people. So mostly then they get possessed and they get spiritualists. Their Kundalini only rises up to Agnya and some spirit comes into them, they become spiritualists. But you people even if it crosses Agnya immediately they start curing. When it crosses Sahastrara, this point, the last point, then you enter into that area or into that subtle awareness which is all-pervading. Just now we came that you are different, she's different, she's different. There's a thread passing through you. If your attention becomes that thread then you can pass into anyone. That's how though you know yourself, you know your problems, everything, you also know others immediately. That is what is the collective consciousness about which Jung also has indicated. So you have to expect collective consciousness. That is an actualization. That is that your consciousness, your awareness gets that dimension in actual form that you become that. To explain it I will tell you. Like animals walking through dirt and fields, they never feel any dirt or fields. They cannot see beauty. But who's that? We cannot walk through dirt or fields. Our awareness is very different from that of man's. In the same way when you become this then your awareness becomes so beautiful that you start feeling the same. You start feeling the wrong. I don't have to tell you, you may not just do it. I don't have to tell you, automatically you started feeling what is good for you and what is bad for you. Say our person has not come. I never tell, don't cry, like a Muslim. No, I don't. Got it. You go ahead, have cancer, have a little nicely then come to Me. Have your liver absolutely shattered. Be a drunken fellow then you come to Me. All right, doesn't matter. Then I realize it should take place. Immediately the priorities change also. Absolutely. You'll be amazed, I've seen people who have been terrible drunkards, you see. They said, Mother we can't clean. I said, what happens? We want it. Same thing happened with Trista. He started vomiting. And he couldn't take, you see. I never told him. You just enjoy something else because if you get the nectar of life then you don't run after fingers. Useless things. Your dignity becomes different, you become different, it's entirely different. Your sense of enjoyment is so different. You become really beautiful flowers and the fragrance people can see from a distance, even from a telephone. It's so dynamic and that is what it should happen to you. For that what should you do? People say, Mother what should we do? Nothing, just ask. You have to ask. You have to knock like that. Absolutely. Even if you do not knock your Mother is going to knock at you. She's very persuasive. She will come to your house, make you comfortable, massage your body, massage your head, massage your back, work on you and she'll see to you that she takes you out. She has too much patience. And you'll be amazed that if I'm tired I feel better when I bring you to that. Like this Patricia came once, she said, Mother you do so much for us, you do so much and let me, I must do something for you. She said, What can you do? She said, I'm very good at massaging the feet. I said, I'm not good. She was massaging My feet and her feet were massaged. And she couldn't understand this. And she was feeling relaxed, she was massaging My feet. I said, What's happening? She said, It's not surprising. I'm getting relaxed while I'm massaging your feet. So that's what she said. But you must know that you cannot give me to you. I'm here to take you and you are going to take me. That's your right to take me and you'll have it. It's your own. It's like a mother who loves you such a lot and she has such a lot of properties. Everything is your own. Just take it, just have it. You see the greatest pride for any mother should be when she sees her children cry on her body. And then they achieve their own power and render it to other souls and they become the joyous, happy, blissful children. That's the way I see My dreams and I'm sure the time has come that it's yours. I'm sure. I had to come to London and they have lots of Sahaja Yogis in there. India is a place, it's full of food vibrations no doubt because we have had great things coming to Me, when Christ was there. But it's like when you have the teeth you don't have food to eat and when you have food to eat you don't have teeth. Like that is the situation. While here you are the saints are born in this country and you are misguided. And there we have people who are not seeing and they have the vibrations. This is the real environment of Sahaja Yoga. They think you know, so many of them think that you people are seeking because you are upset with too much of machine oriented you see, that's all. They think it's more, you're seeking is more like a remedy for ills that you have got in you. They do not think that you are seeking something so deep and that there is a seeking of love. They do not understand. But in India also I must say Sahaja Yoga has clicked very fast and once the fire has started on you, it's very fast you see. And how it's out, it works, it's so interesting, it's so interesting that you at least feel it, you know. Like in Delhi we had a program of opening this book, releasing this book for the first time and they said, I see now this will be too much for Me, how will I manage? You see I have never done that sort of a thing. They said, no, no Mother, you have to just give a lecture, that's all. You think it's Sahaja Yoga program and then we look after the rest of it. So the President of India, you see, was somehow cured by Me and all that and so they wrote to the President of India, he must have done. Luckily he never turned out, that's a good idea. So they said, Mother we can't get him, so why not you become the President and I said, if you think I'm all right, I don't mind becoming the President. And the whole press was there, all the members of parliaments, everybody very critical and all of them came, can you imagine? We had taken the, they were taking a hall for two hundred people, I said, no, no, I have to stay for eight hundred. So it's a village fell up, I said, you just stay for eight hundred people. And they, all these people came, I don't know with what ideas they gave them but there was no place even on the, in the passages, to move diversity in the passages. And I said, look at this, new phrase coming out and I said some things which I've never said before. I have used lot of tact in this life of mine because people don't want to hear anybody. Like Christ, what did He say that I am the light, I am the heart, which He is. This is not egoistical, is it? You think so? I mean if you are something, now if I am nirvana, I should say I am nirvana. Is it egoistical? Like Krishna has said, Sarva dharmaram karita, ya mame kamsa dharmam. You have all these dharmas, all these like religions, He doesn't mean the religion within, but what He's saying, there are all sorts of sustainers that you have observed. Just come to be surrendered and so that you go beyond all these sustainers. Was He egoistical? But He was very tactful, He didn't tell the masas, He told only to ajna. Nobody else but somebody who had an eye and ear to hear that, heard it and looked it out. But Krishna never told it to the masas, no. Christ did that and what did He do to him? He didn't do any harm, did He? Just what this sentence? So I will extremely tackle it. I am very elusive by Me, children. So don't be taken up by My words of doubt. That's one. I'm elusive, that's the only way I can approach you. People have tried all sorts of things like Krishna's, you can say diplomacy, then Christ sacrifices, now My is the style of elusive things. Because if I were not, I would not come to Me. First of all I must appear just like Him. Which I do not so much sometimes but most of the time I do. And I should be thinking just like Him. Absolutely and you will never know. In your hearts of hearts you will never know. But the illusion will be all the time maintaining so that you receive it fully, completely and you master it without feeling any awe about Me. You have to be absolutely free, absolutely free. And I assure you all the protection will be there. Now Me. Now the parts of life the way you can manifest your powers. I hope this great country, India, which I have said again and again is the heart of the universe. You must understand heart has to stand up for reality and has to find out the standards so that you prepare for the advent of the last terrible one who is going to come with his eleven destructive hours and just going to sort it out. There is no persuasion, no realization, no knowledge, nothing, just sort it out. Before that you have to save all your friends, save all the people and salvage them. And you are the warriors, you are the people who are going to do it. I'm just in the background, I don't know how you do it. I talk that's all. Now you can get your second style. You can see for yourself what are the centers and how they are represented on your feet. When you are realized you can start feeling it. For example these children had cold you see so I started feeling burden on the right hand feel it. Not that I feel but you would start feeling also with the cold the children had and it's working out. This is the center of Vishwamigam and when there is cold you feel it and the right hand is the physical as I said. On the left hand it is then the person feels guilty. Mostly he may be a Catholic. It's very interesting you know to find out about people and you are amazed when you discover it. Like Gavin you know one day he was worried about his father that he got the electric vehicle. Why do you worry just see the vibrations you see. This is telecommunication absolutely. So he said Mother I am getting heat here. I said that's your father's. He said this is all father this is your mother. I said all right. So he's got something wrong with his problems. Must be bronchitis or something. So he brings up home and the mother says that you see father has had very bad bronchitis starting problem. He saw even Nixon going into problems you see. He could see him long time back before it happened you see. A person may appear to be very great, a very big saint. Just put your hands lastly. You will know what sort of a fellow he is. Your vibrations will immediately stop or you will get tingling sometimes burning sometimes you will miss this. It's that bad. You yourself you are the instrument. You are the one who right knows it. You are the one who cures it. This is the power of self-realization. Is there any question? Yes. I've got thousands of questions I want to ask. I've got thousands but what you're talking about Peter and David told me this about your own self. What is the relationship between the self-realization that you are able to give almost immediately and enlightenment in the sense of being free from the wheel of karma. Do you see what I mean? Enlightenment what? Well in the sense of being free from the wheel of karma. Do you see what I mean? Immediate. Immediately. What is karma? This is also a theory you must understand what is karma. Karma who does the karma is your ego. What karma's do you do? Nothing. Is your ego that gives you the sense that you are dead. You don't do anything whatsoever I can tell you. Is the ego within you which does it. Now the ego is here like this you see rises from the right goes like that and super egos like this. When the Kundalini rises both are sucked up and your attention is above the ego. When you laugh at it, oh Mr. Napoon and how do you do sir. The karma's are dissolved because you have no ego. It's like this very simple. Is say when the sun is on the side you can see your shadow. All right? But when it comes on your head the shadow disappears in you. But one is sort of when you really, well in the Eastern scriptures because you know the Western scriptures they have reincarnation. One is sort of led to believe that this is something that takes a long time. That's how they must do it. You see all of them are like that thugs. So what they have to believe they have to make you believe into something. You see otherwise how are they going to say why you don't get it. Is that your karma's? Then why are you there? You see what I would say that what are you doing there collecting our money? Simple question. You see if it is our karma's by which we are suffering you are the one who are cleansing. There's one very wonderful one in Bias. He said I take only one upon hundred and something of your karma's. I said why this mathematics? Why not the whole of it? And then he says you see for the rest of it you have to work hard. And what is working hard is service. What is service? Big big trunks you see and there's a big piggy banks you see. Bigs like that and the piggy banks is the service. And people from all over the world come there for that service and they are cleansing. You see there'll be fooling of it. I want to also put it another way around that you said earlier something about we come to you as it were for some reason. Is it that in the past we have done something to show the merit coming to you? Is it like that? Because it seems it's always too easy you know to see what I mean. It's difficult. Now I tell you one thing very simple is. See your breathing is so easy isn't it? Did you consult any book or did you find out about karma's? Because it is so important for you. In the same way your evolution is very important. If you are not evolved the creation will have no meaning. It has to be the simplest of all. Sahaja. Spontaneous. How can it be difficult just think of it? It has to be the easiest. But I'm not going to let people off lightly I'm sorry. The thing is I've always felt that if my life is difficult it's because I've done things wrong in the past which have made it like that. You see now. It seems unlikely that my life is suddenly going to change. This is an old trick they have tried with everyone. Like your priest telling you come and confess something. Now those who have not done anything what are they going to confess? So then why not something? One must have done something otherwise I have to face the priest what about telling? Then ultimately the priest lands up in the lunatic asylum also. You go and tell him I confess I confess all nonsense. It's like in India you see we had a priest coming to our village you see and he started teaching them about Christianity. When he was going the head of the village you see didn't know how to thank me. He said, sir we are thankful to you for visiting our village. You have really enlightened us because we did not know what was said now we know what is said. It's like that you see for this enlightenment only in modern times you have to pray. It's so simple. They have done the difficult work Christ has done it all. What sense can you commit myself which is greater than the love of God? Tell me why. The thing is that if things do go a bit wrong for once. If things do tend to go a bit wrong. If one can somehow say well it must be my fault in the past then you don't feel bad towards anyone else. Whereas if you feel that you are blameless and things still go wrong you tend to blame other people at least you see what I mean. Is he? It's better to get yourself into a situation where you are in the wrong way. You see we are like this either we destroy others or destroy ourselves. Must we do that? We need not destroy others and destroy ourselves also. We are neither guilty nor we are putting guilt on others. Can't we be in between I mean can't we be sensitive. We are just an agent. It's just we are destroying ourselves by feeling guilty. We are destroying ourselves by that. You see it's a self destruction you see actually this ego oriented society came up to a point that when ego became too much ego. So just to counteract it you see you started with a super ego. And super ego is that just oh you are egoistic and you are no good and you are so horrid. You will be responsible for Vietnam for ED I mean for all the that Bokatha. Everybody will identify with and you will feel guilty. Why you are a beautiful person? Either you will feel proud of it and egoistical or you will feel guilty about it. Now what am I to do? You just think of Me as you. It's a funny situation and it is not true. It's not true. You are neither guilty of anything nor you are to be wrong because whatever is, is that. And there is no guilt which God cannot give you. Because you are very sweet people. That's why you are guilty. But then one comes back to the old question of you know why did God create a world which has suffering in it. I mean this is a sort of classical question. All right, all right. I'm going to answer this one. The classical one. Also I can answer this very simply. Why did you have a child? In the same way God has his own child. His creation. This feeling to have a child has come to us from God itself. As we want to have child, he wanted to have a child. He wanted it to grow, mature fully and then he wanted to grow with all his powers to that child who enjoyed and see for himself. This was just a play of God. His will, his we can say his pattern of feeling that he wanted to express that he created you so beautifully and then he created the whole universe. Everything so beautiful for you to know the beauty of him. So now has come the moment of maturity. Is that why it is so easy to get that? Yes, yes. This is the time of blossom time. Yes, of course. Like you see you can have only one or two flowers. All right? The beginning of the tree. It's very difficult to protect the tree and all that was done. Now it's all come up. The blossom time has come. And at the blossom time you do not have to bother, you have to become a fruit. That's all. You have to become the happy. How do you know that this is the time of the fruit? Because it's happening. How do you know it's the fruit time because there are fruits? You can see the fruits. You should also see those who have become fruits, how they are fruits. And you become the fruit and see for yourself how you become the fruit of God. You can see thousands of them. You can come with Me sometimes to see in the villages. Thousands of them experience feeling the cool breeze. But feeling the cool breeze gradually has to be understood and to be practiced and seen for yourself and mentally to be accepted for Western mind, not for an Eastern mind because we know cool breeze means that. They are not to be told but for a Western mind. You have to see for yourself what it does, how it works, how it clears out, how it, what it is, how it is. So I would say that you get your realization very fast because of your past. But you settle back again, unsaddened, because of your present. In India you cannot get realization very fast because I think they must have been the ones who must have been in England not and not, who must have seemed to bless them, those who are born in India now, who are trying to rule and develop our country to a new Western world, you see. So, and you have the real idea but the present has been quite dangerous. That's why the problem is there. So it settles back, but it doesn't matter. With many it does not also. I'm just telling you for precaution because what happens among ten people, the one who is supposed to be the most dominant, he settles down first. Being dominant dominates others and they also settle down again. You see because the people who are very dominant by nature always has certain feelings on others. So the one whose Kundalini goes down is the one who is really dominating, might be possessed or might be something wrong there, maybe any sort of person, but that person will dominate others and the others will take lessons from that. It's human nature, you know, it's very funny how they go to lunatics for training, same people going to lunatics. What do you say to that person? I would like to ask certain questions also. Do you want me? How do you do certain things? You can't understand, you know. I just can't understand. You see a man going to the park, coming out, falling down, getting hurt, you go into the same ditch. How do you do it? So many things, you know, I would like to ask sometimes to human beings, but by the time I ask you become realized, so I cannot ask you because you are different. It works so fast and because it works fast, are you going to deny it? It's all promised, all promised in all the scriptures promised. If I say now I have a diamond with Me here, specially to Indians, will you say that how can it be that simple? You will say better have it, isn't it? Indians I would say are very good. You see, you know, the techniques that we've been doing, we've been told that it's so difficult to get there, that there's so many working, there's so many things that have got to do. No, the trouble is the techniques... I'm sorry. I will tell you, the techniques they will tell you are difficult, otherwise that's the way they exist. But in fact we were told the techniques were easy, but in fact all the time there's problems. That's even more contorted. This is what led us to think of ourselves as one and others. I am saying how they fooled you completely, that's all it is, simple, in simple words, absolutely, very simple. It is terrible. Thank God you have come to this point to listen to Me at least, otherwise you would have beat Me for saying this. You see, the techniques that are telling you has no meaning, nothing. You read ordinary immediately, it is said. Now Shankaracharya himself said, no, yoga, na, sankhi, na, by any method you cannot get it, only through the Mother's grace you are going to get it. And in his last book, he wrote all this vivekachuramani, this, that and all these duties he gave and in the end he just praised the Mother. That's all. Shankaracharya is nothing but the praise of the Mother. Of course he was very clever. Every stanza has a mantra in it. But he just praised the Mother and people asked him, what's this? Such an intelligent man like this, he's just praising the Mother, he says, that's sufficient. That's the praise he does too. But if there's any moment of praise with God, you would think that if you're saying that TM questions of the wrong road, then somebody in TM would be fairly justified or feel fairly justified and say that you're also the wrong road. So how does one know? Yes, that's it. You see, now you should judge it by certain things, you see, what is the wrong road and what is the right road. I told you the whole lecture was about it, isn't it? I told you how to find out. Did he give you your own power? First question. Did you get your own power? Means, did you have any powers flowing through you? No idea at all. Then can you make out what's wrong with him in collective consciousness? I know that I had no power before I did TM. As a child I had much more power than I have now. That's it. That's it. But apart from that, today when you get your realization, you will know what's wrong with him, what's wrong with him, what's wrong with him. You can cure it, improve it. You can see with your naked eyes the Kundalini about which people have talked pulsating in your presence, yes, you can see it, I can show you normally also, with your own eyes. Did he do that? Only thing he did was counting your money. But his nephew was managed to polish off most of it. One has to understand that this power has to manifest through you. You must have your own powers. Why do you worry? He might be a great powerful person, all right, so what? Who are you? You do not even get the know-how of the whole thing. Imagine. You don't know what he's talking about, what are these mantras. Just go and ask anyone, any one of these Sanskrit scholars, if you want I can supply this. If these mantras are even Sanskrit. I'll give you an example of this. You know there's a very tremendous difference between a learnt Indian who's a Sanskrit and a person who's not. We have here one scholar, Tharudwaja, who's asked, he's not realized so well, is he? But he knows about Me and he knows that. Naturally if he knows about Me and if he's asked a scholar he knows about it. So what I say is written there and that's what I do. And these people wanted to call him for a wedding, they want to have internationals. So they told her that Mataji will have his Me into this culture and it's all right. He said, what an occasion for Me to see her in person. He did not even tell you the meaning of all these mantras, he did not tell you the know-how of it, he did not tell you how to move, nothing of the kind and you think he's greater than you. Why? You do not know anything about yourself, you do not know anything about anybody else. What have you got out of him all these years? Q. You have too. A. It was clear to you, you see. Q. He says he's got you out of it. A. I feel we have, is it not true that one has to just keep searching and keep searching? Q. That's guru shopping? A. Just keep looking, you don't just give up. You see, this is another problem with the Western people, it's very bad. You see, Charlie Chaplin, have you seen him, he used to fix those nuts on that, modern times, did you see that? And he was on and on with nuts like that and when he was even released from the work he would be going on. He would forget that now the release has come, it's something else. The guru shopping is still on. Till they finish the last pie of their purse, till they have exhausted them completely, till they receive all the curses of these gurus with multiple sclerosis and all that, they go on and on. Still Mother is waiting for you, whenever you will come, go off to the place. But why waste your time? For what? Have you got too much money? Mentally you cannot understand, you cannot. Don't try to rationalize, don't try to rationalize. With that horrible fellow he did not rationalize, why didn't you ask what is he doing? You couldn't ask that question to him. Now see the difference. Why? I respect you for this, that you are free, you can ask the questions. You have to be free to be completely liberated. You accepted him, I don't know how. He didn't even tell you why he was doing like this. You the intelligent, the infectious, never questioned. Why didn't you say that how do you say you are the one who's giving us the right? Did you ask him the question like this, My child? You should have, how much money did you pay him? The difference between that and this is that with that I was learning a technique. What is it? Learning a technique. A TM technique which I thought was to do with relaxation. I wasn't looking for spiritual guidance and I also wasn't looking for any kind of deity or figure of worship and I never had that right back then. You see, it's all right, you may not look out for anyone or anything. You wanted to have relaxation. You cannot have relaxation at all. You cannot by any other method. You have to accept yourself, you have to know yourself otherwise you can never be relaxed. It's a simple thing. As I said if your petrol is going to finish all the time, you are going to be tensed up. Unless and until you are realized you cannot be relaxed. That's the time when you are realized. That's the time your ego merges. But it's relative relaxation, it's opposed to absolute relaxation. What I was seeking. No, but you see this is not a shock. In seeking there is not a shock on that you give Me five percent, you see. I want meat only half lakh. You can't do like that, you get it in the mind. But you have to ask for it. If you say, I was not seeking. Who are you? See a question comes to Me. Ask yourself, who am I? Why did I say so? That I was not seeking. Who was I? Was I a person who had lent money to somebody that I was asking for it? See the attitude you see of an intellectual is like that. You must ask questions to yourself. Who are we? We are asking. I am seeking this. Now on what premises you are seeking? I'll tell you that. You go to a shop, all right, it's a little. But when you are seeking, on what right are you seeking? What has given you right to seek? I'll ask this. Only that you have some money, is it? I mean, I began seeking because I was about two years old. I just knew I wanted it. You are different. You are different. But I am talking about her question. You are different, it's correct. I am asking her. That if you say that I was not seeking this, I was seeking this. Was there a mark at all? That's just a question of awareness and not your seekers missing. Yes, it's a question of. But still supposing something is missing. Now I would say that you do not have Buckingham Palace. Say for example, that's missing. Can you ask for it? No, how can you? You have no right. Just see my point. Did you follow the point? It's a very subtle point. You see the point? When you are seeking, I am seeking this much of that, on what grounds? Let's see. On what grounds are you seeking? What right have you got to seek anymore? What is your basis? Let's see that. You see we go to the bank, all right, I want five hundred pounds. If you do not have any account, then they say get out. If you have an account, then you can do an answer. Now do you have any account for seeking? What accounts do you have? If that's the point, you reach a point where you say, I don't know. That's the only answer you can get. So I would say that you are seeking not because you think you are seeking, but seeking is embedded in you. It is in you. You did not ask for human life. From amoeba you have become a human being without asking. And you have been made to have. You have freedom to ask for it. And when you ask for it, because you are a human being you have the freedom and you have a right to ask for it. That's the only right you have got, to ask. Why? Why you have to ask for it? Why you have a right to ask is this because God is not going to fall at your feet and say that take your realization. No, you have to ask for it. It's not right. But it's not. This is the point you follow? He's not going to fall at your feet and say that my child asks for realization. We'll show. We'll put you into such a curse, such wonderful things that you get out of it. To get this gift is a privilege. Do you know that? It's a privilege to be self-realized. You do not adorn God, God adorns you. But if you accept the reality you become greater. But reality doesn't become greater. This is all ego idea, you see. I seek reality. As if you are obliging the reality, are you? The reality cannot be obliged. You are going to be obliged. This is only possible for the guru to take money from you and you can say that only give five rupees worth of statement but I don't have any money. You follow? And when you come to this point of understanding that how his ego plays tricks with you even you think and they have used it. Do you know that? They have used your ego. They have pappered it by saying that you can pay for it. If you know I can purchase the root. They have paid on the American ego much more than that of English. And that's why they are still there. I have a difficult to bring them out. They said, no Mother, we paid for it. I said, go ahead, youngies, go ahead. That's what you can say. One of the gurus has become a youngie now, you know. He dresses up like that and only he have had fifty three carriages. He wanted to buy one ship which of course the English thought was too much. They were sent out to America. No, no, he had not canned us but he had rose for us from English people gift to the guru. Now don't play into the tricks of your ego. Try to understand it's a privilege if you can get Self-realized. They have always denied all the incarnations, all ego-oriented people. That's the sign. When Christ came they denied Him. When Krishna came they denied Him. When Rama came they denied Him. And they kept up their ego saying that some incarnation is going to come later on. Then He is going to hang all of them to the island. That's what He is going to do. That's the one He is going to come last but not the least. Try to understand. It's a gift to you. Take it with gratitude. It's the beauty of God what you have to know. Just talking about it or thinking about it or being mad about it or doing any sort of a funny gesture about it. You cannot get it. There's no technique, nothing. God has made all the technique. Out of His technique? All your techniques are really? No, no, no, no. It's my balance. It's only my balance. Absolutely. To have people. Now it's their turn. Yes, they are from, they are from Wellington. All right, all right, I'm going to be here because she is going to be bothered about lunch. I'm not, I'm not bothered. You get Maria. See Maria. What a sweet child she is. See, look at her. She is so beautiful. Took no time for her to be realized and to reach her name. She's giving realization to people. What a satisfying life she had. She's so beautiful, so beautiful. Such beautiful children. Expose your beauty. Know about it. Enjoy it. Why do you want to end up your life like this? Because maybe there's some condition in mind. Somebody has taught you like Hindus, you see, you get some ideas in their childhood, they'll go on with it. Some, there was a lady, she used to pick her hair like that. I said, why you have to do this? She said, my grandmother told me that if you pick your hair like that, then you'll go to Swetha. I said, now when did your mother, grandmother, I said, long time back. I said, now she's dead, at least finish this. But till the age of seventy, she was doing that. All her life. She's been dead all her life. The conditionings are so much, you see, and it's all top, top, top, top, top. Be careful. You be careful. It's not real. It's not real, but what is it? It's light. Like the gurus. There are many fake things, but best are these gurus, I don't know. So you can come tomorrow and bring your mother. Very sweet children, but one child is sick. She has to sit with the child. Tomorrow? Will she come? Today, tomorrow. Today, yeah. It's her child, and she's not coming tomorrow. Can you sit with the child? What's the matter? Tonight. What is wrong with the child? Hindi word kya hai? After koi guru hai kar na? Kya hai na koi na koi guru ma nahin mai? Naa nahin mai? Hai hai. Oi bhutan uche pata chikha? Lai ai bhut chikha. Is kurmukh pata kar aha? Abhi nahi hai. Kone guru? Jyosi pe dha. Jyosi pe dha. Kaheen nahi rata? Naa nahi kya. Burmigam. Burmigam me rata hai? Jyona huska? Naa, mizumal hu. Hukuska. Hukay ko paal kirakhe? Kaat na paal. Kuch nahi kar paal. Huska paad yokchi hai? Jyoti bata taha hai? We follow him. No? I need a charity. He's downshifts but like... See there's a fellow who is supposed to be answered by the... He is an astrologer. And the child is caught up. I asked her, do you go to anyone here? The child is caught up. Now you can see yourself how the child is caught up. In Birmingham. See, it won't be, it will be afraid of... You are seeing me there. Now let's see what will be my question. Maybe. I thought the question was just out here. Can you feel it? All that side is possession. All that side is possession. All that side is possession.

I don't know how to tell you because it's too much, that's too much you have done. Every Sahaja Yogi should feel that way involved as Yogi feels. I think the amount of involvement he's shown in Sahaja Yoga in such a short time is very remarkable, is extremely remarkable. And a person who has been to all kinds of gurus, all kinds of ransoms because of his seeking has come out of it so fast, has got into Sahaja Yoga, has grown so fast it's rather remarkable, it's a very remarkable thing and I think it comes from previous life. This is the previous life Sanchita has seen. People are coming to Sahaja Yoga, days together, they don't focus, they don't get involved to that extent, very surprised. So I think it is his Pumba Sanchita as they call it in the previous life. May all of you also use all that is past and today you can all achieve this kind of involvement with that. Full faith that you are standing for the truth, a truth which is so essential today for the emancipation of humanity. You are doing such a tremendous task and you cannot do it half way. You have to go full ahead with it and I must really say that he could be an ideal for many of you. He could be a good idea, he meditates, he's going deeper as well as he's working it out, outside. So let's give him a hand. May God bless him and his family and all his members and Mother Earth, people in his family, all of them should be blessed for this kind of service.

Now we see the salvation. The first salvation happened is that God's almost played a game in the mind. Because he had promised there was a big snake and he had to keep his cup here. So the Lord had to go there and he had to go there. He said that he played all his things. There he took advantage of that salvation and he should have adored the people who are there to stir and trouble others. But it's the best way to play the game. Come on, everybody. He had to go to Maya, he had to go to India and all these things and all these things explain to you why Krishna behaved in the manhood and what it means but for the Sebastian Maya or the seeking Maya, he had to stay in the house. Why should he play the ball? Because because he died, this is God who is not playing the ball. All the hard work is about. I should be behaved like this. What was the difference? In everything that the Divine is God is a God, there is something very deep and very thin but it's not like there's anything here and there and sometimes this is equal to things to Maya. So traditionally she finds that everything and every word, every thing has been but the trouble is that those who have their own understanding cannot understand. This is the very thing that God has given us that they know it is not real, it is not real. They don't know what it is. They don't know what it is. This is the last one. This is the last one.

It's much, yes, it's a approximation by instinct, approximation by instinct. You intuitively do it? Ah, intuitively, yeah. Tuition, tuition. So, what is happening? What is it? I said keep the legs of the tripod's blade, so he opened his legs. So much identified. The tripod. It's interesting, isn't it? There should be. No. Knowledge, you can do it already. Is that clear to you? Oh, yes, very great. They should tell the story of the ghost on theall right now. They will do it like a spider, but it was wikr mad. Because he was a trickster. Front of house people sitting down. Everyone has good time inside. I don't think we could have done this outside, isn't it, Warren? That's good here, Mother. Yes, but you're comfortable. Then we would have done all these, taken there, but light, without the light, is so difficult. Then we would have done all these, taken there, but light, without the light, is so difficult. How do you like it? They want to know. I hope they have washed the meat all right, please. What's this going on here? Big filming? It's a whole production Shri Mataji. I think it's how to be portable when you haven't got a portable. It's how to be portable when you haven't got a portable, He said. This will be more better. Real mixture, doesn't it? You have got butter with you? Butter has happened. You have got butter with you? You have got butter with you? Just say the smell. Where is he gone? It's getting better by the way. It won't be hot but it must have that fragrance otherwise. He's having one after. Better to take this than to take this water. It doesn't change the first part. It could have been very difficult outside. You see this looks like a big, what you call, something but it's not, it's very simple you know. Very simple it is. But now for 140 people naturally it's anything even if you make two large. It looks like that. This one is a very traditional dish called Akhnipulao, Akhni. Akhni means soup, you can say soup but it's juice. Akhni is juice. So you take out the juice of the mutton and then you make the rice boil in that. The beauty of this thing is that the rice looks absolutely white. You don't see that as much anything but when you eat it, that's the secret of it. Yes, thank you. Pani aslati dalakalu chisatastu te. Imagine musical soy pak. So this is the thing is that pulao is the one that is cooked rice, rice cooked in ghee, with ghee is pulao. But this is Akhnipulao. We have different, different types of pulao. This is one of them. This is Mother's style. This is something looks very simple but it's very tasty. I think one of the tastiest pulao you could think of. In Greece they make the same thing and it's called pilao. Pilao, yes, but same style? Pilao, yes, yes, but they have different style. They fry the rice first, you see, and then they make it. While we do that also but that's very heavy. This is very light and you can eat more than any other pilao. This is the pilao. This is the pilao. This is the pilao. This is the pilao. Little flavor of that and I mean if you want to eat it with that you can try. Mother, it's wonderful having all our Indian brothers and sisters here. What is the last one? You should take it out. What I'm saying is you shouldn't eat it. Just it will be there. You should take it out. What I'm saying is you shouldn't eat it but if you like you can try because Indians would eat. I said in one kilo of rice only two of these cut like this then if you don't eat then what will you eat? He says this I can eat with my teal just like that. It should be covered I think. The whole masala will go up. The smell goes out. For Indian cooking smell is very important. Not so much of a show. I mean we'll not have so much show, you see. We are more particular on smell and taste and less on the show. You don't waste any energy on the show. Isn't it a fact? Don't you think so? You don't bother. No dressing up, nothing. Just put everything as it is whatever is natural way. You eat it like that. Can you eat this? We do eat. I mean we like it that way. Not bad. It will be very good stuff. Actually it will be cooked with the thing. Can I have my chappals I brought mine? I'd like to see if they are under these over there. No not you mother. We'll look. Go around the other end. You brought another one. We had one in Nashik. Remember we had the diesel. Isn't it? Very good idea. I tell you. You can cook much faster. Yes please. Thank you. You got this. Thank you. Thank you.

poet and a great realized soul called Namadeva. He was a tailor, but in the Kingdom of God he was a prince. And he met another prince who was a potter and his name was Gora Kumbhar. Kumbhar means a potter. So how they recognized each other, what love they felt for each other. They were from two different places. In the same way when Sahaja Yogis meet each other from any places whatsoever, they just feel that love, that oneness, that goodness, that belonging. And as they were great poets, they describe it that I came to see here the formless God and here I see him in the form. Nirguna is the formless and the saguna is the form. The beautifully put everything so well, it's very touching and gives Me a great hope that whether you are from India or from England or from America or any other country, you are all born of one Mother and you are realized souls of a very high degree. The sign of a very good high soul is that he recognizes the divinity in another person and enjoys that, worships it and loves it. Same way Shri Namdev met Nanaka, he went to Punjab and his poems are written by Shri Nanaka in his great book called Granthasa. So how he respected this gentleman from Maharashtra and he was in Punjab. So the distance does not matter. What matters is the oneness in your spirit. That time there was no Mother to tell them, no one to guide them. They were all alone in different places but whenever they had a chance to meet they would travel for miles together to see each other and enjoy each other's company. I see that vision now among you all, so thank you very much. It's a very beautiful song, I wish you had known Marathi language. It's not too easy to translate the whole thing.

Yoga, that's why it's called Ambe means the Kundalini and Shri Mataji. When they say Uday Uday that means, O Mother, get awakened. As you see, this is the folklore, the folklore they used to see that O Mother, please be awakened and let Me have the yoga. That's called in the Maloekvai language or the rustic languages. Yoga. Here is made into Joe, like as we have Yeshu and Jesus in the same way.

This is a song written by another great poet, Ignat, great poets we have had, all great saints and poets. And the song is so subtle and so beautifully blended with the rustic life that in every village they sing this song. I wonder how many really understand the subtleties. It's a thing that I'll ask for the yoga from My Mother. But then throughout what She says is that I will give up all these attachments that I have, I will give up My false pride, I'll give up My ego in a way as if you give up all your funny relationships and funny ideas of relations and I'll become absolutely without attachment and then you give Me My yoga. They're asking the Mother. But also it also says that you will, I will then collect all the flowers of My bodha. And you know the word bodha means is what you feel on your central nervous system. All the experiences on My central nervous system, I'll collect them as flowers in My flower container and I'll give it to you. It's a very, very subtle song. You know when you, I didn't know it, I mean I didn't hear it that intensely as I did it today. And then it says that, so I'll cross this, cross this ocean of illusion, pass through the tunnel and this is the Brahmanadi, through the tunnel at the end of it because Eknatha was a great, very great poet and a realized soul. He said these things in a very local language, I should say very rustic language and in all the villages they sing this song. So that basically the roots are there, people are not naive. You see this is what it is in this country that, especially in Maharashtra, it's not difficult to talk to them about Self-realization, about Kundalini, about anything. It's gone into their blood. And this is surprising, it's just a folklore, it's a folklore, such a subtle one. And it's a fast number.

60594 Talk4

Without the nine descriptions of the nine, the foundation of the Goddess and the ten, when She sits on the eighth line and goes for the crossing of the limits, I mean, where She crosses the barriers. Beautiful because it is said that She takes different forms and that's how they have described all the forms of the Goddess. There is mantra on vibrations, do that. Yes, Gurdwara. Shri Mataji, it looks like I wanted to ask you if the fan has any meaning, it must have. I wanted to ask you whether the fan had any meaning, it must have. I'm fanning for you all.

60594 Talk5

His poetry is beyond really any logic, any mental understanding. So great he is, so great. And how he got all these words put together with such little alliteration, all kinds of metaphors, all the figures of speech, and in such a fast way it sings, so beautifully done. May God bless you all. Harsu Gade.

or a last melody of parabi. And after that, you know that tomorrow morning you have to go and maybe that you can go late. You need not get up very early. But I hope you get up by nine and leave by nine thirty. Because you'll take about one and a half hour to reach the river where you are all going to be stationed very well near us. Beautiful river which is known as Pravara. And they say that you should take a bath in the river Ganges but you should drink the water of river Pravara. And you'll be stationed there in a beautiful surrounding. But you'd like to have a bath also. So the sooner you leave the more time you'll have for a bath. If you reach at eleven you'll have three hours. If you reach at twelve you'll have two hours. So it is for you to choose. You can take your time. It's all arranged for you. So, the one was saying the food will be ready at two o'clock. So you organize it in such a way that it's one and a half hours journey and two hours minimum of a bath. So whatever time you think proper you better leave and have a nice time there. I may be there, may not be there, I can't say. And after that we have to go for the public program in the evening so you can rest there. It's a beautiful garden they say. And next day we have to go to Rahulay, to Pune, I'm sorry. So that's how it is going to be. Moreover at this juncture I would like to thank great musicians who are sitting here. Mr. Samantkar has been such an asset to Sahaja Yoga. He has brought beautiful melodies, beautiful songs of great devotion and dedication and such lilting rhythms that you all are enjoying it so much. I hope to invite him sometime to London and to other western countries and to America. This is the same joy that one feels for a Sahaja Yogi. As you are all Sahaja Yogis and he is also Sahaja Yogi, this joy is so much mutual. I thank all his party and all the other people who are here and his brother who is singing so well and all the ladies who have such melodious voices. All of them have been very, very kind and very adaptable because I don't know what happened to this Mr. Temple when he reached him. We were late, I just didn't understand. Whatever it is. We must be very grateful to God for bringing us together in this manner, in singing the praise of the Lord, in such surrendered moods. It's a very rare sight for Me, very rare sight. I really enjoyed it thoroughly. I am specially thankful to Dr. Sangwe, Harsh and his family and the family of Dr. Sangwe. All the others who have helped him to make this visit so successful. From all the Sahaja Yogis, I would like to thank them very much for making this spontaneous stay so successful. Last but not the least, I thank all of you for bearing up lots of inconveniences in this country of ours where it's very comfortable for the spirit but not so comfortable for the body. I hope the rest of the journey would be better, more comfortable and you'll enjoy it more. There were certain mistakes and that's how some of the things were left behind and some people must have had a bad time. But in Sahaja Yoga you have to forgive and forget and enjoy the best. So I won't be able to meet you tomorrow maybe before the public program or maybe I may be there, I don't know, I don't know about myself. It's a funny situation and last of all I've got something for you to spread on the ground. For everyone I've got a present today and something to cover up yourself. For the ladies it's different, for the gents it is different and I hope, they're all lying there and Harsh will tell you to whom it belongs. They are all handmade things from the villages and hand printed absolutely from the villages and very subtle if you see them. Moreover they'll be useful to you in this country and when we go to Brahmapuri we'll wash them and they'll become very soft. Just now they're hard as in the beginning it's rather hard in India to travel. So now we have got something very, very nice for you. Team Peace, lay out to the Khadai, that's all and then we'll have the last music. This song is called Ganah Tuji Gongadi. Have you heard that song sung in England? Bhimsen Yoshi sang this song in England. He was a very good singer. He was a very good singer. He was a very good singer. He was a very good singer. He was a very good singer. He had sung in England. Bhimsen Yoshi sang this song as Ganah Tuji Gongadi and he says the gongadi is a rustic type of a blanket which is used multi-purpose sort and he says that that is such a beautiful one, means this body and while mine is not so good, I'm full of pride, I'm full of ego, I have so many funny things in my head what sort of a gongadi you have given me. That's why I'm giving you one gongris which you can enjoy for sitting down and spreading and it's very good and when you wash it, it becomes very soft and nice. So that's one thing and then there's one sheet for men and one sheet for ladies. They also look very crude to begin with but if you wash them, they'll become very nice and they can be used for various purposes. Can you bring? Such a lot! Or Jains Kalai? We sound for small little girls, you see, also for smaller ladies we have something smaller but the bigger lady something. This one for the men, it's very interesting this one is. Let me see. Now this one is for a little girl said Natali can have this. Natali come along to cover herself. Now this is interesting because I think the men would love it. It's a beautiful piece of art, all handmade. And this is borne by the Aboriginals here and is all done with hand, you can see it so. It's quite subtle. So this is for the men and that's for the ladies and how do you find it? Just cover it, let's see. And this is for the achy sizes, for each one of you for sitting down for meditation, for anything that you want to have, these ones are. Looks nice, isn't it? So you can get it distributed now if you want or later whichever way you want. So I've got all these things today. How do you like this one for the men? Now this one for the ladies. Some are small and some are big. So there are four in one. So somebody should take charge and distribute it properly. Properly. Even bigger than this area. So depends on you just distribute it according to the sizes. It's quite nice, aren't they? Yeah, they are very beautiful. So, and that's the Gomudi for you.

First of all I'll give you the little details of the lecture that the creator of this institution was Gagnya Maharaj and the gentleman who is looking after is the one who spoke to you in Marathi language. His name is Mr. Jee Zaba Mohitet and he just keeps on everywhere bhajans and then he gets money for this institution. And this is the institution of children of the parents who have to go from places to places they are like the trees. Getting jobs somewhere if they have to they are the ones who break big boulders of stones and make them into smaller stones for the purpose of road building or anything like that all that kind of a work they do. So they can't stick on to one thing and they are worried about their children. So this school was started by one great saint called Sangharaja Mahara who has done lot of social work in this country to raise the standard of people's awareness by giving them some education. This school imparts education of human education and its children are kept here in the hostel and they say there are two hundred and fifty children who aren't the hostels and fifty are in this hostel. That's the institution you are given. Somebody has now donated a piece of land to Me very near where I was staying. Plus we might be able to acquire some more land here nearby. Under these circumstances I think Brahmapuri will make a good, very good place for you to come and work out on these children because they have to have some professional education also. I think only the education in free art is not going to be helpful for their future life. There are the events of professional education is a mechanism and all that which we have to think about and you have to come and teach them these things. I told them they will do it free of cost. As the result has said that poverty anywhere is a threat to prosperity everywhere. We have to go faster all these people here. I think it's very important to show you a special thing called Balkham as we say. This is single bar. You don't have any opportunity. And I am very happy to see them because this is a place of Shri Ramdapati. He found out Shri Ramadapati and He was Hanuman himself and he believed in very good health. His effort was to build up the health of people. If they don't have proper health they cannot be good couples of God. And that is why I am very happy to see that this practice here in Angapur as a blessing of Shri Ramadapati. You all know about him very well but this side of his life that he wanted people to build up their health like Hanuman is being practiced in Angapur and they have come all the way to show you this special body building thing they do it on one pillar. You don't need much space for that. It's a very wonderful thing they have come here. So I wanted to thank the institution for organizing this program. Also you will see this beautiful body building exercises that they have. But this is done with the God in your heart so that you don't catch in your heart. It's not just an empty exercise. Thirdly the people from Satara want to give you some presents to every center, to every country I should say. To all the fifteen countries that are here they want to give some presents and that will be later on once this is finished. Thank God for that.

You are a stupid, but should be dignified like a man. She will run and must give all protection to your wife and proper guidance, wisdom to them. They should be made to look after others for you. They must be made to share with joy, to marry you with others by giving them pure love. One should not possess a wife or possess anyone. Some of you might try to possess a wife to such an extent that if he is jealous of your children, I see that he doesn't take care of you in surgery. You are not to be jealous. But if the wife is doing something wrong, better inform me. Don't start beating them. When I say that your left arm is catching. All right. Now every lady should be in charge, one lady should be in charge of man. Let us see, have you applied? Now this is to be applied. This one. Thank you. Those girls who have been, who have taken their baths can go back to their rooms, change their dresses and come to the pen dolls. This is the fragrance for you. These are all fragrant things.

This is the pune. This one also is for the boys, this chain. Now this Mangal Sutra is given by the boy to the girl and the boys have to carry. And you should bring them when you are getting married, like a wedding ring, but don't forget it in the rooms. Every girl must bring her Ganesha with her. Will you please remember, don't look this side, that side, listen to Me. You all should bring your Ganesha with you with all these ornaments. Now this is something. Plus I'm giving you, as I told you, for the girls these necklaces. Plus you have purchased those, all the girls have purchased these. This is given by the boys to you. All right? So you must thank them for this. So this is from the boys to the girls you are giving. Now as it is, be problematic, we cannot separate it, but when the girls have it they should give out of their things to the boys whatever is to be given. So the boys must have a Mangal Sutra and a chain which is their own and buttons for their shirt. All right? And the rest of it is for the girls. Now the rest of it is? All right. That they will do. I'll tell them. The rest of it. For the girls. Which is from Me? This one is the hand for the hand decorations. Or you can... This one is for the nose, is to be pressed and put right. You can press it and adjust it. This one is the toe ring. And these are, you know that, ankle. This one is for the head, three. One goes like that, one like that, three gunatmika, one center. This one. Do it carefully and with understanding. We'll have Indian ladies to help you. All these things are here to be divided between you. Now, should we start the boys and the girls coming in? All right, all right. Just a minute, just a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Need not cover your heads just now. Once you marry, then you may. You see, it's not a custom in India that everybody covers the head. Depends on to what part you belong to. If you want you can cover, but in the wedding time you have to, will look nice, that's why. Do whatever looks nice and decent. In My family I have to cover My head up to this much, very orthodox people, up to this much, like that. You don't have to do all that nonsense, no. And you have to wear it this way, sorry, that's another nonsense. It's very uncomfortable and also makes you lousy, but you need not wear it. Really it makes you very lousy. If you wear that way you can't just work. It's good for ladies with riches and lots of servants. After taking these presents you go and sit down in your own places. You exchange and sit down in your places, all right? But something more has to be done. Come along. Now number one. Just a minute, just a minute, both this, just a minute. Number two, one by one. Sit back. Milka and Kamal. Number two. Remember your number, number two. No. Number three. Brian and Antoinette. Please remember your numbers. Give it to her. And the cap also is there, caps are given. Caps are there. Caps are there. Caps are there. Caps are there. Caps, caps. You see it is forty-five marriages, you must know. So we have to be very sensible. Now we have got bangles of different sizes. It's not easy to give you bangles of your size. Now you have to yourself see the girls to see whatever suits you, all right? Now this dhoti is to be opened out and there's a scarf to be cut out, is it? You have to use a pair of scissors. I hope you have. All right. Cut the portion. Should I show you? Here there is a border and on another side there is a dhoti here. The longer size is the dhoti and the shorter one is the scarf like that. But you don't wear like this, you wear the full length. It's not getting married, you see. You see there is a line there. So in that line if you can do it like that, all out. In between the line. So these are two different pieces now. There's nothing to be that serious, very serious. Simple, very simple. Now come along the second one. Next one, next. Oh you got already cut out and crushed by Me. Come along, get up now. May God bless you. Next is Frank and Maria. Next is Shri Mataji. We got this. Take this. Get up now. Too much is not possible now. You see little bit. Go ahead. Quickly, Shri Mataji. Be careful. If the thing is big then you give it to bigger girls. May God bless you. Next is Shri Mataji. Next is Shri Mataji. Do you all understand girls if the size is too big for you, seek a smaller one from perhaps a lady who's got a big one. May God bless you. Helmut and Petronella. Now you can pass it on to your husbands whatever is there. Be careful, keep them carefully in your pockets. May God bless you. Shri Mataji. Shri Mataji. Shri Mataji. Shri Mataji. Shri Mataji. May the ladies when they receive the jewelry for the men please give it. Please give the men's jewelry from Shri Mataji to the men now but look after it men. When you have your bath or when you change or look after it. Brian and Francois. Now give the numbering. Now give the numbering. Also keep the mangalsutras with the boys. Mangalsutras should be given to the boys and they should not forget to bring it. Mangalsutras must be given to the boys and when the boys come for the wedding they should not forget to bring the mangalsutras. Shh. Fast, fast, move fast. May God bless you. Vaasanth and Sarita. Ah, yeah. Ah, yeah. Ahn Rajal. . May God bless you. Robert and Elise. Lewis and Carol. Mary and Sunita. Wear your undershirts. Always. May God bless you. John and Shubhanchali. Pino and Vyana. Now those boys who have carried from Me should return it to the wives or to the brides. Don't keep with yourself. All right? May God bless you. All right. May God bless you. Enjoy yourself now. Give it to her, whatever is hers and whatever is yours. I think best is that the girls take it is better because they can more things for the girls or let the boys take it and give it back to the girls. Also you must check if there is something missing. We have done lot of sorting out. I could manage. I am very happy. I would have been very unhappy not to do it but it's done. I am very happy. May God bless you. You can exchange there. May God bless you. You take it and give it to her, whatever is hers and keep yours to yourself. You don't have to think. You go into thoughtless awareness otherwise you will not enjoy. Take out the ornaments. Christine, take out the ornaments for men and give it to him. Don't forget. Bhagavan and Bridget. David and Julian. Yuriy and Judith. Shri and Jan. I think the men should give it to the lady and they can separate their better off. Brian and Lillian. William and Liz. Naviya and Sylvana. Robert and Belle. Nae and Agnes. You are all looking very much shiny with the oil I put it in the maldi. Gavin and Valerie. May God bless you. John and Ariane. May God bless you. Jean-Louis and Elizabeth. May God bless you. Godfrey and Cecilia. May God bless you. Please sit down. Anna and Michaeli. May God bless you. Russell and Lillitha. Russell and Lilla. Charles and Lillitha. Lawrence and Lillitha. And Fred and Fran. Gary and Ursula. You'll. May God bless you. May God bless you. Get out of all this nonsensical thinking. Enjoy yourself. Just. Some of you have got only dhoti's and not the covering cloth. So you should check up and if you need one you ask her, she'll give you. Not now, you can do it later. Now the main of... Now the problem is about few things, is about the bangles as I said. So I don't know how will you sort it out. Now the new couple that has come is for, what's her name is? Who is the new one? Richard and Kirsty. You see he wanted to get married but we couldn't arrange anything last minute. May God bless you. So it is impossible to arrange anything if you don't mind. You keep it. Has she got a saree at least? I don't know. Now don't argue. If just now if you start arguing, I don't know what will be the end. All being sorted out. Now we have got a to carry with every boy has to carry. And this will be sending you in your rooms where you will be getting ready. So the boys and the girls should get into some one place or two places at the most. This is the one the boys have to carry. I, if you want we can give it to you or they can be given later on is better so all of you when you get settled on the bullock carts they'll be given. The girls have to bring their Ganesha's which I have given them. All right? Now you be seated. Now you be seated. Now you be seated. Now you be seated. Now you be seated. Now you be seated. Now you be getting your marriage presents after you are married because you might some of you decide not to marry. See, so it is better now also now until about one hour you can decide again. All right. So this done now. This is most of it. Now only the program. Program is such that the boys have to assemble. Warren is responsible. Warren, we have a committee. Warren, Gregor. No, no, no, he's there. Warren, Gregor, who else? Warren would not have been there if he had decided to marry. All right. So we have one Warren and another Gregor and third is David Spyro, who is the fourth one, and James. So we have four people and they have to look after the boys. Now before you get into a shock, your mother has to wear that mukut all the time. Now for all these weddings all the people are getting married have to wear that. So we are sending it over where you will be getting ready. So Warren is seated, that you take that. The Naryans, everybody, for the girls as well as for the boys. It's a pair business. Better take that time or... All right, so remember that, you have to take that. Now, where are the boys going to be? No, no, get one place. No, no, is there a big room there some? There's one community room or something? There's a canteen room, yes, there's a canteen. There's a canteen room. All right. You all have to get ready and be at the canteen room at four thirty. There it will be given to you. So that at five o'clock let us start the bullock carts moving. Five o'clock, it's too early. But there has to be with lights and all that. So keep it up five, it will be five thirty. Mother, would you tell the girls they have to come here after the canteen? All right. No, they are not going to the canteen. No, no, no, no. No, nobody is going. The girls are going to come here somewhere. All the girls must leave their quarters. to the canteen after getting ready and then they will be tied up with this and so then after that, so canteen what time I should ask them, five o'clock? Yes, just before the bullock carts. Say about just before now. Keep it four thirty. It will only take ten minutes. Depends on. Four thirty will be all right. Four thirty to get them there. Keep it four thirty to get there, half an hour to tie it and half an hour to get into the bullock carts. I think that's sufficient, should be. All right. Now all the men have to come with the boys walking with the bullocks or the bullock cart. The bullock carts will be starting from there and the Bharat will be starting from a half distance. The Bharats will be waiting at half distance to decide that and they'll be coming in with the band and everything. So in combination Now these four, five men are in charge. In the sense they will guide the party, the wedding party, as you see the bridegroom's party. But these other people are in charge of the boys. Now, the boys have to come to a temple where I'll be waiting. It's supposed to go to a temple to a goddess. So you're all right there. Then the girls have to be ready before what time? Thirty. All right. Thirty. All right. So before that the girls should be ready by say five thirty, five o'clock. Because I will come here first, you'll do the Gauri Pujan, five thirty and five thirty you should be all ready and then I will go to this temple. These boys. And the girls have to be here, six o'clock they can be here also because temple is very close by. So the girls have to come and stay here and organize themselves. The men's timetable stays the same? No, they have to arrive at the temple at six. After the procession. After the procession. Six, six. The thing will be at six thirty years. So twenty minutes they'll come to come down from the temple. So the six thirty before that the girls will be here because I'll have to come here first and then go there. Common deity what to do? The girls don't have to go to the temple. I will be going to them, they'll do the Gauri Pujan there and then they'll come and stand here. They all will have to stand here. From one we'll start from that side, no, no, one from this side to the end of it. The boys will be coming like this and one will be at that side. So the one that side and one this side. Then you have to move all these steps. Now these steps you move if you want to decide not to marry you can decide. This is for the girls. This is called Swayamvara that you have chosen your husband. All right, now what is it? Six twenty. About six twenty and then I will come here first and go. Yeah, I'm all right. Six twenty they should be there. Six thirty here. Now do one thing. Six ten or so you must arrive at the temple. Keep it like that. You see in these forty five marriages you cannot be. Of course there is no bus already. There is already a bus. Now we have a bus but now on this point I have to say one thing. The first priority should be for the people who are getting married. What I have found those who are not getting married are much more at ease than the ones who are getting married because I saw so many brides and bridegrooms walking and the rest of them coming by bus. That should not be the case. You all should take the buses earlier, come down here, settle down here and keep then the buses for the bridegroom and the brides. But bridegrooms don't need because we'll have bullock carts but for the brides. Those who want to come by buses should come here earlier and settle down here. After tea say four o'clock you can come down here and settle down and four thirty. What time the girls will be coming? No, no, no. They have to get ready now. All right, you'll get ready and then come here. It's better. Then it's all right, then you can come five thirty is all right. Even six is all right but five thirty. Leave at five thirty so all the girls must assemble at a point. No, no, not at the... Now you can do one more thing. You come to My room there, five thirty, do the Gauri puja, all of the years and then they get into the bus and come here. Now tell them five thirty you come to My room, all dressed up, do the Gauri puja there and then you come along. That's much simpler. All right. All right. No, no, not at the Gauri puja. Yes, not at the Gauri puja. It's there, and it's a place to live. Yes. No, not at the Gauri puja. No, not at the Gauri puja. Yes, not at the Gauri puja. Now you see we have to have one husband, one father and one father, one mother, one father. Or the father and the mama, or mother and the mama, mother and her brother, mother and the mama, minimum, or father. Mama or father or mother? Mama or father. And one girl, one girl as a little girl, say about young girl unmarried, as the karwali. And for the wise one, best man. Younger, younger, if possible. Anything else? Anything else for the couples? Best man for the boys? Anyone else for the boys? Just the best man? You have a little brother of the girl, little brother of the girl, very small boy. He is the little brother of the girl. No, no, what he does is the larger home. That is her bridesmaid. A little boy. Brother. Mother. Mother and father, if they are, essential is one. And the girl side should be women, Indians, most probably. Girl side should be Indians, not boys, girl side. Wow! Now, on the girl side because somebody has to guide. So the mother, the mama should be Indian, the young girl should be Indian, the little boy, brother. At least the mother should be Indian, mother or the father, mother or the mama, one of the girl. We can do that. Now you go and tell these Indian women, those who want to be the mothers. That's all you get. For our relaxation of the woman. Shri Mataji is now selecting for the girl a mother. A mother is now being selected from the Indians for each girl. No, no, those who have applied already, you see they have applied to the girls, particular girls. Yeah. Yesterday, this morning I have already done it. Just show your Indian mother where you are, please. Please sit exactly opposite your partner so that we know who is missing. Your daughter, sorry.

Four girls have, you see I must say, give them a hand for their patience. For one minute. One minute. One minute. Jayasri Mataji, let us. Before this, can I say one word? Oh, twenty words. That if you allow Me, let the bridesmaid join the girls here and start with the mainly because that will take some time while these girls are dancing we can start. Are the bridesmaids here? Just one minute. Have you had your food? All right, let us do it after food. After the food the bridesmaids have to come and take mainly from here for their rights. Jayasri Mataji, can you begin, Mataji? Let us all celebrate the marriages with a dance on the Ganesha theme. Ganesha who removes all obstacles and who is the sublime expression of auspiciousness. This dance is based upon a story which is often told to us by Sri Mataji. There was a divine quarrel between Kartikeya and Ganesha when their father Lord Shiva brought a divine fruit. Lord Shiva said, that person who goes around the world, the universe tries and comes first will get the divine fruit. Kartikeya, the nimble-footed Kartikeya, immediately got onto the vehicle of Mayur Vahana, Peacock Vahana and started going around the world and he had a flying start. Lord Ganesha in his spiritual wisdom thought for a while and he came to the conclusion that there is no other person greater than his mother. The whole world is a manifestation of his divine mother and the whole world is immanent in his mother. So if he goes around her thrice, he has done more than going around the world thrice. So he went around his mother thrice and started eating the divine fruit and finished eating the divine fruit by the time Kartikeya came around. So the moral of the story is we should be totally devoted to our mother, that is Sri Mataji. We should totally surrender to her in our bhakti and that is the only way by which we can get Yogatseva and also our spiritual ascent. This mother about whom Mr. Vinagopal spoke, the mother of Sri Ganesh, the mother of Sri Kartikeya is the one sitting here, Sri Mataji Nirmaladevi. Thank you. Thank you. Sri Shankar ji, mita amul aaye, mita amul aaye, sariga bani sariga. Sariga riga pada paani bani sa sa nipani pada paagarika riga. Ek dim sri shankar ji, mita amul aaye, tabu maa, Sri Ganesh, aurika mikeyame, ladai. Takita takadimitam. Sri Shankar ji boleh, din loke parikrama karike jokpehle aaye ga bahi mita amul paaye ga. Sariga riga pada paani bani sa sa nipani pada paagarika riga. Sariga pada paani sariga. Ga ye ga nopati jagavan dana. Ga ye ga nopati jagavan dana. Ga nopati jagavan dana. Yadini sariva bhuteshu, Lakshmi ruvena sanstika. Namaste, namaste, namaste, namaste, namo namaha. Yadini sariva bhuteshu, Vidyarubhana sanstika. Namaste, namaste, namaste, namo namaha. Yadini sariva bhuteshu, Lakshmi ruvena sanstika. Namaste, namaste, namaste, namo namaha. Yadini sariva bhuteshu, Maa tri ruvena, Maa tri ruvena, Maa tri ruvena, Maa tri ruvena sanstika. Namaste, namaste, namaste, namo namaha. Ga ye ga nopati jagavan dana. Ga ye ga nopati jagavan dana. Ga ye ga nopati jagavan dana. That is the wisdom of Shri Ganesh, all right? That's what it is. So may God bless you all. I'll take your leave. Any other problem, you can consult these people who are here, as I've told you, and I'm sure everything will work out very well. It is a very auspicious occasion, is no doubt. Also it's a solemn occasion, no doubt. Also it's a joyous occasion. So try to enjoy, but one need not be frivolous, cheapish, enjoy within yourself. May God bless you. Come here for the brides, only the brides. All right. After the food all the brides should come here and they will be given this mendi thing and they can walk with that back. Have they to go back? Now buses should not be used by other people so much. Should be more used by the bride and the bridegroom. So they can get the mendi on their hands and go back to their places, rest for a while. Now we have another problem is of bangles. Now this you can wear before Haldi or after Haldi, whichever way you like. But just now if you want you can select it and see for yourself, whichever way, because it's a very big problem, bangles. Those who do not have bangles specially should come and see for themselves. Now Mrs. Yadav is in charge. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Please don't go yet. Please don't go yet. Ladies please sit down again. We have more things to do. Ladies please sit down. One girl has not got a bernisha. Doesn't, well, don't ask me.

All this lot of time now there is a little dance we are going to have. You see, believe it. All right. He is the, he is himself an artist, all right. So we can work it out together, all right. But he wants to get engaged just now. But he'll marry next year. Is it all right? All right, we got this. Please give Mother a big hand. No, no cross. Let us have it. Four girls have, you see, I must say, they give them a hand for their patience. For one minute. One minute. One minute. Jayasri Mataji, let us. Before this, can I say one word? Oh, twenty words. That if you allow Me, let the bridesmaid join the girls here and start with the menly because that will take some time. While these girls are dancing we can start it. Are the bridesmaids here? Just one minute. Have you had your food? All right, let us do it after food. After the food the bridesmaids have to come and take menly from here for their rites. Jayasri Mataji, can you begin, Mataji? Let us all celebrate the marriages with a dance on the Ganesha theme. Ganesha who removes all obstacles and who is the sublime expression of auspiciousness. This dance is based upon a story which is often told to us by Sri Mataji. There was a divine quarrel between Kartikeya and Ganesha when their father, Lord Shiva, brought a divine fruit. Lord Shiva said, that person who goes round the world, the universe tries and comes first will get the divine fruit. Kartikeya, the nimble-footed Kartikeya immediately got onto the vehicle of Mayur Vahana, peacock Vahana and started going round the world and he had a flying start. Lord Ganesha, in his spiritual wisdom, thought for a while and he came to the conclusion that there is no other person greater than his mother. The whole world is a manifestation of his divine mother and the whole world is immanent in his mother. So if he goes round her thrice he has done more than going round the world thrice. So he went round his mother thrice and started eating the divine fruit and finished eating the divine fruit by the time Kartikeya came round. So the moral of the story is we should be totally devoted to our mother, that is Sri Mataji, we should totally surrender to her in our bhakti and that is the only way by which we can get Yogatyama and also our spiritual ascent. Devasaksha Shri Mahalakshmi Mahasaraswati Mahakali Tregu This mother about whom Mr. Vinayagapal spoke, the mother of Shri Ganesh, the mother of Shri Kartikeya is the one sitting here, Shri Mataji Nirmaladevi. Devasaksha Shri Mahalakshmi Mahasaraswati Mahakali Tregu Devasaksha Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmaladevi Nirmaladevi Nirmaladevi Shri Ganesh I and Nama Shri Kartikeya Nama Shri Nirmaladevi Nirmaladevi ... Gaya Ganapati Jagavan Gana Gaya Ganapati Jagavan Gana Namaste, Nirmala Mataji Jyotirmi Sarva Putte Shoo Matri Rupana Matri Rupana Matri Rupana Matri Rupana Samsita Namaste Sri Namaste Sri Namaste Sri Namo Namo Gaya Ganapati Jagavan Gana Namaste Shri Mataji It is a very auspicious occasion, is no doubt. Also it's a solemn occasion, no doubt. Also it's a joyous occasion. So try to enjoy, but one need not be frivolous, cheapish. Enjoy it within yourself. May God bless you. Come here for the brides, only the brides. All right, after the food all the brides should come here and they will be given this mendi thing and they can walk with that back, have they to go back? Now buses should not be used by other people so much, should be more used by the bride and the bridegroom. So they can get the mendi on their hands and go back to their places, rest for a while. Now we have another problem is of bangles. Now this you can wear before Haldi or after Haldi, whichever way you like. But just now if you want you can select it and see for yourself, whichever way because it's a very big problem, bangles. Those who do not have bangles specially should come and see for themselves. Now Mrs. Yadav is in charge. Please announce that the whole boys party, which is all the men, by 5 or 4 or 45 should all are filled up on the temple which is on the way between the camp and the water. Nobody knows if there are five temples. He has to be a simple people. We have to get him to tell us. Please don't go yet. I think you keep it because she'll be wearing this for the wedding. He knows that. Ladies please sit down again. We have more things to do. Ladies please sit down. Ladies please sit down. Don't ask me, please, you start discussing.

Hello. Is he well? Now, I have to tell you for the brights, you have to move very slowly behind these girls and little boys who are like, will be sprinkling flowers for you to walk ahead. While walking you have to be careful, put your heads down and then you can see that there are things in between. Try to avoid it and walk very slowly with your foot down. With your garlands in your hands. So you have to go and stand till this cloth is spread out. This would be holding you away from the, your bridegrooms. Now, then while standing you move in a proper way, one, two, three, four, five, and wait there, there will be seven stanzas will be sung to wish you good luck. When the seven stanza is sung, yeah, when the seventh stanza is sung, then you have to throw the, what you call the, these, we call them akshatas, you stand there. At every, at every stanza's ending we'll be throwing these at the boys and girls. Some from that side, some from this side. Once that is over, then when the curtain in between is removed, then the girls have to garland the men first, but see that they are your bridegrooms. Nicely we'll already organize it properly with the names and everything, but still. And then the boys will garland you. Once they have garlanded you, your parents or your uncles who are with you, who will be following you, will bring you back to one of these places and you'll be settled down there quietly. And the boys will be brought to the same places by them. Ataje samur bastele mulahe, tane haathama de phulaguin, halu halu agdi halu halu samur bagat, kali man galun zahe ji, nishade ke chalne ka.

Tell her. John, is it on? So. Let the little boys sit here because you see what I'm saying. Let them sit here, all the little boys, little children. All right. Good. Hello. Hello. Hello. Sit down. Facing that side. You have to face that side because there is going to be music and dance. Right little bit like that. You have to see the music. You sit here. All of you sit this and. So before the dance we will have some songs. Let the little children come here if they want to. Now you sit down there. Will you sit down? Want your dolly? There. Sit down. Sit up to here.

So Shri Mataji, we would like to offer at your lotus feet this dance and this music which is our first attempt in Italy of integration between Indian and Western performing arts. Good. So. Naniya, you mean respect to us maybe I might be. So. Dance should represent the beginning of the great work of Shri Adishakti and it is contemporary Western dance which is quite free from the classical patterns of Western dance. And the music is an attempt of finding in the Western music the links with the Indian music. And so we found that the correspondence of the Indian ragas are the so called Gregorian moods. Gregorian? Gregorian moods which were the scales used in the Middle Ages up to the beginning of the 17th century. Did you say the Gregorian boots? No. Moods. Moods with M like Milano and non like Bologna. Thank you. And for the rhythmical part we have chosen some riffs which could actually somehow fit both in India and in the West. And some of these riffs, rhythmical patterns are from the East Europe like Bulgaria, these sort of things. So this is just the very first experiment. The music is being composed by Federico himself. Now you turn round and see the last. Just turn down. Tell them this is still open. Yes like this if you sit down. And for the instruments we also try to integrate the things and we use an electric guitar with a sitar bridge which is a great new instrument and No, no it's on tape. It will be on tape. And for the keyboard we use the synthesizer electronic instruments and both Western and Eastern percussion. This is contemporary. It's contemporary just one month ago. In the present. You see there. Music Music Music Music Music you This is ballet dancing, very beautiful ballet. She does Geno's ballet, you see that's how, beautiful, very good. But see this dress looks so nice for a ballet dancing, isn't it? Looks so beautiful and graceful. The way they use horrible dresses for men and women is horrifying actually. Absolutely horrifying. If they use nice dresses it will look so nice, you know, it will add to their charm. Looking so nice this dress. May God bless you. Beautiful, yeah. What next? So Shri Mataji, now we want to offer at your feet some bhajans. All right. You are going to say nothing. No? Children must give a song also. Children also must sing. No, no. It's all right for me. It's all right for me. Is it Samit, Samit or Akhda? Akhda is from this place. Yeah. Samit? Yeah. Samit, Samit. Samit. Samit. Is from, is it from, is it from, is it from, Cambridge? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I feel the whole atmosphere must be charged with Chaitanya. Especially from the innocent people of Italy it should come. Such saints is really glorified. I feel really glorified by such saints singing the praise of Shri Ganesha. You must be all awakened within you in its full bloom getting you ready for tomorrow's Sahastrara, I'm sure of that. May God bless you. We want just to offer to you the last song in Italian and also a short song in English which is joined to the one in Italian. Just a minute. But I would like to have the script. Beautiful, look at that. Bhagit laga toh mein. Oh, ate bath hakrena goll saag hain. Shasti bhanda karun vadak na stok hai. Sounds kruti. Me sounds krti ke liye karo. Okay. Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Me Oh Me My Yeah Me man It's very creditable because in such a short time, you prepare such a beautiful music. These are the people with great heart. Just imagine, I can't believe it, how it has spread in Spain. It's beautiful. May God bless you. May God bless you. May God bless you. May God bless you. May God bless you. May God bless you. May God bless you. May God bless you. May God bless you. It's such a fast number and one better than the other, you know, you just get into the lilt and it's like a ocean of notes pouring one after another. It's beautiful. All right, let's have it. All right, let's have it. They're very beautifully lilted. You see the lilt of the music is, shows the, again the heart I say, which is so full of joy and the exuberance, the expression of that is the music. Beautiful. Thank you for coming first of all and thank you for singing. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. This is composed by a Sahaja Yogi, eleven year old. Can you imagine? So beautifully done. And, may God if you want you can read. Everybody has got this? All right, so you can read the translation. They should know it's a beautiful. Yes, you can read it. Queen of the sky, star of the day, be always, Mataji the one who leads us. Let us see that we have been liberated from all karmas and sin. It is you who liberated us and enlightened us. Giving happiness, giving harmony, you have transformed our lives. Mother, it is you to whom we can pray. Mother, it is you whom we can love. Mother, we all adore you, we love you. You give us such happiness, Mother. We all pray that you give light to our path. Thank you so much. Thank you from the heart. We can pass that there. Should we translate the second one that's coming also? Let him translate the second one. Hello. Let him translate the second one. Hello. Let him translate the second one and then you can sing. First read the translation in English? Yes, first read the translation. Give that. Loud speaker, yeah. That's better, always translate it first is better. This is the next song. Spain is so lucky and so the Spanish are, of having you as our mother with such a great heart, with such a great heart, which gives shelter to everyone. All the Spanish now come to offer their heart to Mother and to our brothers, who have always helped to bring Spain up, which has really been hard. Well, thank you Mother for giving so much, so that we, your beloved children, have finally reached here. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. For the love of God, for the love of our brothers, for the love of our brothers, for the love of our brothers, for the love of our brothers, we are grateful. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Now they, Just see how much joy they have brought for all of us and we are very thankful to them for bringing this joy all the way from Spain. I know it was hard in the beginning, but, but I tell you I love you very much, the Spanish. Really I love you and to see you here, makes me so hopeful that someday the whole of Spanish will become Sahaj. In My face there's some resemblance with Spanish people, I think. So many people have remarked that I look like a Spanish. Must have been some forefathers living there. The way I'm attached to Spain, apart from that, though it, in the beginning, it looked rather difficult, I went again and again and I knew it would work out. And again this time I'm coming for a longer period. It's Me. God bless you. Thank you. You'll be in July, isn't it? Yes, in July. I think in July, August, July. Spain, North, that's earlier. No, no, July I think. Yes, in September Mother. In September, because it's very hot there and you told Me that there will be holidays, so September will be the best, all right? Yes. What happened? He's been crying. Cry. What is happening? Why is he crying? I asked him now, because he's always distracting the other children. Is it? He has got a little agnya, I think. All right. All right, all right. All the children should behave beautifully. You look so nice and beautiful, isn't it? And you are sitting on the stage, everybody is watching you. Such beautiful things you are, aren't you? All very nice, beautiful and behaving very well. All right. So Shri Mataji, now we will have some bhajans from France. Okay. Next one. Practice ke li kha, mein surat na aiya na. All right. Pazhal. Maale, so many French, just a ratch. So many French. It's basically a very old Marathi song and I've heard Shri Mataji sometimes saying it and she liked it very much. And that's why we thought of saying it in front of her. Namaste, Irma le Devi, Namaste, Shakti Kundalini, Jagamate Kashi Vissaru, Sukhachi Tujata Jahnani, Namaste, Irma le Devi, Nesali Vastri Sagarache, Nesali Vastri Sagarache, Dharitri Dungarhi Duddhache, Dharitri Dungarhi Duddhache, Futhe Panhamala Bhaguni, Futhe Panhamala Bhaguni, Assemi Dundasthana Pani, Namaste, Irma le Devi, Namaste, Shakti Kundalini, Jagamate Kashi Vissaru, Sukhachi Tujata Jahnani, Namaste, Irma le Devi, Naveeta Suryatusekunku, Naditsa Suryatusekunku, Kamalanitranakozaku, Kamalanitranakozaku, Shobhato Har Navagrahansa, Shobhato Har Navagrahansa, Jandranakshatra Tarani, Namaste, Irma le Devi, Namaste, Shakti Kundalini, Jagamate Kashi Vissaru, Sukhachi Tujata Jahnani, Namaste, Irma le Devi, Phoolanchi Bhagvi Phoolali, Phoolanchi Bhagvi Phoolali, Subandashakti Hasali, Subandashakti Hasali, Hasali Shakti Mala Bhaguni, Hasali Shakti Mala Bhaguni, Hasali Bhale Tula Bhaguni, Namaste, Irma le Devi, Namaste, Shakti Kundalini, Jagamate Kashi Vissaru, Sukhachi Tujata Jahnani, Namaste, Irma le Devi. If the French can sing Marathi songs, I should learn French. But French is very difficult, you know that. I've tried many a times, I can't say many words somehow. And it's surprising how you people are singing so beautifully, so correctly. The pronunciations of Marathi are very difficult. I don't know how you people are singing so well. May God bless you all. Now we will be singing a Polish, it's a prayer, it's Lord's prayer in Polish. Sveń żyńyńyet vaje, Sveń żyńyńyet vaje, Mvod ojat ojia, Mvod ojia, Tádina żejni, Kleva naczo, Ożejnye lo, Dál namdiśćar, Mvod użnzam naczeżyjne, Dado jeme losingka o bsaji, Mvod eż decorated by Sankar, ... Thank you. Nice to remember Polish people at this time. They are in difficulties. They have been always in difficulties. They have been facing all kinds of aggression all the time. Nice to sing in Polish language and to think about them. One day they should also come to Sahaja Yoga. We have some very few Polish in London, but very few of them. May we have the last one? A one in French also you must say. Old French I think is that English. What is it? Old French. That's better. I hope Mother one time will be able to sing in French. All right. May I have some? Yes. Yes. Thank you very much. Yes. It's not dolki, it's mrudang. This is the sophisticated one. This one is, it's not dolki, this is mrudang. Is a sophisticated one. So Shri Mataji now we have the Swiss Sahaja Yogis. We will sing some bhajans. I don't know maybe in Chinese or Russian. It's common to all I think. As we see very often Sahaja Yogis look very much like each other. Shri Mataji I think is not really a Swiss. I don't know. Is not really a Swiss group because actually we are Swiss, Austrian, Indian, Algerian, what else? Portuguese, French. Who is Portuguese? Who is Portuguese? Who is Portuguese? Maria Melia. That's great. So in short they are all Sahaja Yogis. Shri Mataji. So the first song is actually taken from the Devi Mahatmyam, Shri Mataji. It's supposed to be on page, we're not really organized as we should be, but it's somehow about in page eight because we don't have numbers on our pages. Everybody who is having the blue booklets and brown booklets. So the name of the song we just took some verses from the Devi Mahatmyam and the refrain which everybody can sing is actually, Greg why can you translate? Because we have the French version on it. The refrain everybody can sing is Sarva Mangala Mangalie Shive Sarvarta Sadikhi Sharani Triyambike Gauri Nirmala Ma Na Mostute. The tune means it is you who distribute all blessings and benedictions, all you who are specious and who protect the universe. Everything is realized through you. You who are the white goddess with three eyes. Homage to you Narayani. The song is called Sarva Mangala Mangalie Shive Sarvarta Sadikhi Sharani Triyambike Gauri Nirmala Ma Na Mostute. Sarva Mangala Mangalie Shive Sarvarta Sadikhi Sharani Triyambike Gauri Nirmala Ma Na Mostute. Sarvasya Budhi Rupena Janasya Hare Di Samsite Sarva Mangala Mangalie Shive Sarvarta Sadikhi Sharani Triyambike Gauri Nirmala Ma Na Mostute. Sarva Mangala Mangalie Shive Sarva Mangalie Shive This was too strong. These are all mantras and the whole chakras start moving and revolving fast with it. It's but wonderful for you to organize all this and to sing it so well is in Sanskrit, it's a difficult language and singing with such understanding. I really congratulate all of you, specially the way he sang was wonderful, it's tremendous it was. May God bless you all. Shri Mataji will try to be as strong as the Italians in imitating the Indian songs. They are better than the real. Imitation was better than the real. I think Shri Mataji Italians are first in the hit parad about the Indian songs. Even the screw of My, this thing started moving out of the fabric. Every time after the end of each sentence, after the end of each verse we repeat again Shri Mataji Nirmala Ma Na Mostute. Shri Mataji Nirmala Ma Na Mostute. Shri Mataji Nirmala Ma Na Mostute. Shri Mataji Nirmala Ma Na Mostute. Shri Mataji Nirmala Ma Na Mostute. Shri Mataji Nirmala Ma Na Mostute. Shri Mataji Nirmala Ma Na Mostute. Shri Mataji Nirmala Ma Na Mostute. Shri Mataji Nirmala Ma Na Mostute. Shri Mataji Nirmala Ma Na Mostute. Shri Mataji Shri Dori Anya Chakravarti. Shri Mataji Nirmala Ma Na Mostute. Shri Mataji Nirmala Ma Ma Na Mostute.

If you all know, so you can sing along. Truly you are Nirmala and the three worlds, say your fame. You are Saraswati and you are Kali, yours is God as judgment. You are the Creator and you are the Preserver, to destroy the evil you came. You are the Teacher and you are the Knowledge. You are the Literature, who understand the Knowledge.

The Mother of the Ganesha, God's a care and Jesus are you, Mother accept her soul, he will attract your children too. Our Holy Mother is diving everywhere, Holy is your name. Holy is your name. Holy is your name. Well done. Beautiful. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Just one more. We'd like to finish then with the, we'd like to finish with the song Green of England by Elizabeth. Could you wait until the second chorus before you all come in, so give it some dynamics. Mother let us see the green of England, let us see your water flow from the mountains, mountains snow. Mother let us see the green of England, the joy that shines in everyone like seven colours of the sun. Let us give to everyone the will to be the green of England, let us see, let us see. Come to the old town hearing and the echoing with joy, the tears are disappearing now for every girl and boy. The rivers wide and firm with blood, the frets will clear again, but ours is never victory when fighting in your name. When fighting in your name. Mother let us see the green of England, let us see your water flow from the mountains, mountains snow. Mother let us see the green of England, the joy that shines in everyone like seven colours of the sun. Mother let us see the green of England, let us see, let us see. The wind is troubling, it's on a nip is so, the wheel of fate is juggling, twixt happiness and more. We divide and near our lives, we'll raise our flags, our own. Sing the tourists o'er again, the enemy to fall, the enemy to fall. Mother let us see the green of England, let us see your water flow from the mountains, mountains snow. Mother let us see the green of England, the joy that shines in everyone like seven colours of the sun. Let us give to everyone the well to be, the green of England, let us see, let us be. The lightning strikes so wistly as we realise the truth, the rainbow resonates so good, the gentle veil says prove. As we women in harmony we'll fight eternally, the story in England's green and gold that's lost in centuries, that's lost in centuries. Mother let us see the green of England, let us see your water flow from the mountains, mountains snow. Mother let us see the green of England, the joy that shines in everyone like seven colours of the sun. Mother let us see the green of England, let us see, let us be. Let us be. Mother let us be. Mother let us see the green of England, the joy that shines in everyone like seven colours of the sun. I must confess Mother, I had tears in My eyes during the last song and I tremendous, you can't, I don't know who has composed this, who has composed this song? Elizabeth, let's give a hand. We've got all the naughty brothers, all right? They blush so nicely, Shri Mataji, it's always a pleasure. May I translate this song, Shri Mataji? You are the sun in the sky and Thy light reaches every place. Thy words are pure truth and they shine as gold. Mataji, You are the light of the firmament and You enlighten the path of perception. Shri Mataji, You are the stream of knowledge and You free the way of the ascent. Shri Mataji, ocean of love, Your heart is a deep sky. You are the straight path which removes obstacles and which leads towards the highest summit where our Father resides and the breeze flows in our hands. The deep joy is within our hearts and the peace rules over all of us, spirit merging into the skies. Jai Shri Mataji. Jai Shri Mataji. Humming. Humming. Humming. Humming. Humming. Humming. Humming.

So we have all the countries represented. Any other country which is left out which wants to sing? I think Belgium still wants to do. All right, good. One song. Belgium and Holland together. Germany or something? Austrian don't have anything new. Where is Baghdad? He should sit with them. They have become Belgian, no? No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Wonderful. Beautiful. So many from Belgium also and Holland. Very encouraging. Any other countries left out? German Sahaja Yogis would like to sing something. Dutchland. I thought you read this out so that there won't be any problem and then you give it to Me. And you all want channels, all right? Since we've only got one song we'll sing it both in German and English. I've got children now. Anything right now? Thank you very much. It's so well translated, rhymed and beautiful, very beautiful and extremely sweet. Specially to say this thing is, she's for this purpose born lest all should be gone inwardly confusion and devilish delusion. This is to be seen is something very great of you. I wish you could see the rest of the Germans. I'm quite worried about them, very much worried. I'm happy that Sahaja Yoga has started somehow in Munich and I'm going to go there. I've promised an alcove. May God bless you. Even before you invited Me I told them that I'm going to go to Munich, whatever it is. And also a little place where you were saying I have to go. We'll see that. May God bless you. So now should we say good night? Shri Mataji this was the most like lullaby so perhaps it should be the last one. That should be. Is there any other country which wants to say something? It's going to be a payee. Did we forget a country? No, nobody Shri Mataji. Yes? Except Bulgarian song Shri Mataji. Shri Mataji. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I can see that. May God bless you. May God bless you. It's beautifully sung, beautifully from the heart. Germans are known for music and very good singing, you see. They created beautiful music once upon a time. Now the time has come for Germans to create more music. Same about Italians and so many other great musicians in this country. They are reborn in you and you have to produce better music than what they had done. May God bless you all. All this music should go with Me, I think. Good idea. This one I have, this one I don't have. This one is, this belongs to I think Jose or something. Thank you very much. Tomorrow, what time the English have to go? Not later than two. Not later than two. We must start our puja about ten o'clock. We have to start our puja at ten because the English have decided to go early. I hope somehow, give a bandhan that they get a flight on Tuesday morning. Did you telephone? What did they say? We weren't able to get anything done today. We'll telephone again tomorrow to the airport. What did they say? Well it's not possible for us to change the flight. Those who would like to stay longer, please register your name with Antonio. Antonio from England. If you want to stay longer, please register your name with Antonio in England. If you want to remain in our country, we have to go to the airport. We have to go to the airport.

All right, we can sing Ganesha song. Can we have a man and a woman? Christ's life was such a life of penance that they had to use very soft tunes. and to express their feelings and too much rhythm was not used, you see, because that's the side of Christ's life they knew. They didn't know Him as Ganesha. Otherwise they would have sung with nice rhythm and would have danced. Who can lead the Shri Ganesha song, the Austrian song? Lev, come.

Thank you. consulting the list, we put them according to their age and their heights and things, and surprisingly we worked it out very fast. So might be, might be, there might be some of them, may be absurd. And some of them are left out. But I'm sure by the end of this tour we'll have something nice. Now, there have been certain demands about some type of girls or boys, and somehow they are not there. So I've kept them still. Waiting till we find something to their liking. And I hope so very soon such nice proposals will come. Now, I think I'll ask our marriage pandit to announce the names of the people, whom we have now decided. Already I think, how many there are? Sixty-five marriages arranged. And, okay. Fifteen more to be remarried, and then there are engagements, and some are, as I said, we are still waiting for some better results. So, in this short time, we had another big problem because the UK list appeared when everything was finalized. And we didn't know how to fit UK people. And I thought we may have to marry UKs to UK. But it has worked out now very well that we could manage something better. Now, there are certain things that we should avoid to marry in the same country, as far as possible. Unless and until people are just demanding, it's better to do that. It will solve one problem, I think, that some girls or boys, who think they are better than us, think they should get married, will not quote people in their own country and spoil the whole game. Because if you start quoting like this, as a result of all that quoting is that, that you just get fed up of each other, and you don't want to marry. So the best thing is that let us leave it for the last minute, till we have decided. And if you are not happy, or in any way, if you think it was not suitable, or whatever way you think it proper, because you'll be together now, for the rest of the tour, you must tell us before you are getting married. We have had very funny experiences. Like I married somebody to someone. Then the girl comes and tells me that, Mother, I can't live with him as a wife because I think he is my brother. But this happened after three years of marriage. So if you are in fickle mind, and if you are not decided, then it's better to withdraw than to bring bad name to Sahaja Yoga and to me, and create problems. Second point is that registration of the marriage should only take place if you are all agreed, and that you have a complete divorce, or I would say you are free people. Otherwise there should be no registration, and nobody should take a passport as a married lady when she is not yet registered, or a gentleman should not yet register. Nobody should take such a passport. Because it's going to create more problems and complications. It's a very simple thing to understand that we have to have registered marriages. Otherwise we cannot go from one country to another country. So it is important that we have to register the marriages. After we have considered it fully, after considering that you are, that you are going to be all right with that person, and then to see that you are a free person, you are entitled to be registered. So under the circumstances, if you are not registered, you cannot take your wife or you cannot take your husband to any country that you want to. So one must understand the legal side of it. The most important thing is for married couples, then once they are married, they should not forget their leaders. They should go and tell them as to what they are doing, and what is the help they need, and how to contact. But mostly as soon as they get married, they become birds of migration, or something like that. So it's difficult to locate them. And then the problems start, because they don't know how to proceed. And all kinds of problems so far we have been facing, because the married couple did not stick on with the group, with the leaders, and inform them what they wanted to be done, what they needed the help, or anything like that. So this is a very important point that as soon as you get married, you must inform your leader about it, and you must get the address of each other and leave it with the leader, and also consult him till you are fully fleshed married people. I hope you understand that. May God bless you. So now, here is the great list. Everybody's name taken should get up. I think better come here, because I won't be able to see you. Do you want to come?

So far, whatever was possible we've done, but maybe by day after tomorrow we'll be able to fix others also, because we'll see the people who come here and ask their also opinion about things. And perhaps we might be able to get for all of you something nice. Ok. So tomorrow morning, tomorrow morning, there is going to be puja at about twelve o'clock, I should say, because people are coming from all over. And also some of the decisions we have not taken so far, because we have to ask them. I hope we'll make it convenient for the twelve o'clock puja. Also, I must tell you that saris have gone up very much in prices. And those girls who are getting married, they could have saris according to their own taste, but no sari for a wedding is available for thirty pounds nowadays in India. So, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope, I hope you realize that I have done the shopping in Delhi, brought all the saris here just to make it better priced. But in Pune they are much more expensive and the saris will be for sale tomorrow. And particular type of saris are good for marriages, which they'll tell you. Now we have a demand for saris, about forty-five saris, for about ninety pounds, which have turned out to be about hundred pounds. Those we have separately put. Plus we have saris for marriages and also some printed saris which are cheaper, but not also, I don't think, these are not thirty pounds, maybe slightly more. So we can't help it because the China government has stopped exporting silk to us. And next year they said it would be even worse. So whatever it is, the prices are reasonable and I hope you'll be able to enjoy them. I haven't got any list of wishes, but I have a few women who wanted to have printed saris. So, so far, we have only twenty-nine or thirty saris. But if you want to have silk printed saris, which we'll show you tomorrow, we can get them more up to Ganpati Pule, not before that, because I got them from a special shop. They gave us some also discount. In any case, there's a tussled silk on that, there's nice print, you can see for yourself. Day after tomorrow we are having a program, evening time, fine. And also on the fourth day I would say would be, which day is it, Sunday, Monday? Tuesday, no? Would be on Tuesday. We are having another public program. But you'll have time, daytime, to go about for your shopping, whatever you want to buy. So the charges for marriages are two thousand each for every person who wants to get married. And the money should be collected and given to Mr. Yogi Mahajan. The sari money would be collected by Harsh Mehra. He'll collect the sari thing from you. Now in those saris, most of the saris, there might be a blouse piece. So you can leave the blouse piece. Yes. And also, behind, so they'll get it stitched for you, and also they'll get you a petticoat to match with it. That can be managed before Ganapati Pule. You must also leave your exact, I would say the exact measurement. Now the boys who want to have silk dhotis for their marriage should give their names to Me, so that we can get some nice silk dhotis. But as I said, they are rather expensive. Not very much, but they are. I have no idea of the price just now. So we can get those and the color you want of the dhotis. Anybody who wants to buy dhotis which are colored silk ones, please let Me know. Also there are boys who may be wanting to have a silk kurtas done. But I think if you go in the market, you might be able to get yourself of your own size. Would be better. Oh, are there any towels? Where are they? Are there towels? Are they locked? Yes. They are taken in the morning. Ah. In the morning. Also there'll be a barber coming if you want to do that. Tomorrow we are going to get you a barber to help you. Plus I'll be sending the towels. I'm sorry I could not include that in the price. Oh, they are thirty rupees each. About thirty rupees each, but very good towels, cotton towels. I hope somebody has collected money for the sarees and for the pajamas and the kurtas. Who has done that? You have collected? Yes, they did. Oh. That's all. Nobody should start any collections without asking Me. May God bless you. Or what else can I do? Hmm? Ornaments. Hmm. Ornaments. He has got, how much is it? Number? Sixty-five marriages. Seventy. Hmm? Seventy. But they might be having. About seventy marriages will have ornaments. And those who want to have extra, those who are not marrying, who want to have ornaments, have to give the money to Mr. Bhikkhule, and every set costs you eight hundred rupees. Eight hundred rupees to Mr. Bhikkhule. When you are purchasing from him in Ganapati Pule, you'll have to give him eight hundred rupees. That's all. What else? Any other business? Any other business? No. Baghdaan? cyt1019 Page Еслиف soday Aythu crops Buññ Mega Leteda Pegali Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

They have some shawls here starting from about 140 rupees to 400 rupees, on Kashmir shawls with embroidery. So you can have a look at them tomorrow with the sarees after the puja. May God bless you.

Thank you.

We have tried to arrange certain marriages. But it's nothing fixed. You have every right to change it or to say no or whichever you want. But just to give an idea that luckily, luckily when we started consulting the list, we put them according to their age and their heights and things, and surprisingly we worked it out very fast. So might be, might be, there might be some of them may be absurd. And some of them are left out. But I'm sure by the end of this tour we'll have something nice. Now there have been certain demands about some type of girls or boys, and somehow they are not there. So I've kept them still waiting till we find something to their liking. And I hope so very soon such nice proposals will come. Now I think I'll ask our marriage pandit. To announce the names of the people whom we have now decided. Already I think, how many there are? About sixty-five. Sixty-five marriages arranged. And, or what? And there will be about another fifteen, maybe eighty. Fifteen more to be remarried. And then there are engagements. And some are, as I said it, we are still waiting for some better results. So in this short time we had another big problem because the UK list appeared when everything was finalized. And we didn't know how to fit UK list. We didn't know how to fit UK people. And I thought we may have to marry UKs to UK. But it has worked out now very well that we could manage something better. Now there are certain things that we should avoid to marry in the same country, as far as possible. Unless and until people are just demanding, is better to do that, it will solve one problem, I think, that some girls or boys who think they should get married will not quote people in their own country and spoil the whole game. Because if you start quoting like this, as a result of all that quoting is that, that you just get fed up of each other and you don't want to marry. So the best thing is that let us leave it. For the last minute, till we have decided, on a very temporary basis, and if you are not happy or in any way if you think it was not suitable, or whatever way you think it proper, because you'll be together now for the rest of the tour, you must tell us before you are getting married. We have had very funny experiences. Like I married somebody to someone. Then the girl comes and tells me that, Mother, I can't live with him as a wife because I think he is my brother.

I hope you understand that. May God bless you. So now here is the great list. Everybody's name taken should get up. I think better come here. Because I won't be able to see you. Askinin onirwa with Hans Christian Kuna of Austria. Please come up to the stage. Please come up. She's from Finland. All right. Also we have considered your heights. All right. So I see. Suzette Wood with Carlos from Spain. So tomorrow morning there is going to be puja at about twelve o'clock I should say, because people are coming from all over and also some of the decisions we have not taken so far because we have to ask them. I hope we'll make it convenient for the twelve o'clock puja. Also I must tell you that sarees have gone up very much in prices and those girls who are getting married they could have sarees according to their own taste. But no saree for a wedding is available for thirty pounds nowadays in India. So I hope you realize that I have done shopping in Delhi, brought all the sarees here just to make it better priced. But in Pune they are much more expensive and the sarees will be for sale tomorrow and particular type of sarees are good for marriages which they'll tell you. Now we have a demand for sarees, about forty-five sarees for about ninety pounds which have turned out to be about hundred pounds. Those we have separated out. We have to get them slightly put. Plus we have sarees for marriages and also some printed sarees which are cheaper but not also, I don't think, these are not thirty pounds, maybe slightly more. So we can't help it because the China government has stopped exporting silk to us. And next year they said it would be even worse. So whatever it is, the prices are reasonable and I hope you'll be able to enjoy them. I haven't got any list of women who wanted to have printed sarees. So, so far, how many have you got? Thirty? We have only twenty-nine or thirty sarees. But if you want to have silk printed sarees which we'll show you tomorrow, we can get them more up to Ganapati Pule, not before that, because I got them from a special shop. So, I don't know, they'll give, because they gave us some also discount. In any case, there's a tussled silk on that, there's nice print. You can see for yourself. Day after tomorrow we are having a program, evening time, and also on the fourth day I would say would be Tuesday, would be on Tuesday. We are having another public program. But you'll have time, daytime, to go about for your shopping, whatever you want to buy. But, the day after tomorrow our wedding will be on that day. So, the charges for marriages are two thousand each for every person who wants to get married. And the money should be collected and given to Mr. Yogi Mahajan. The saree money would be collected by Harsh Mehra. He'll collect the saree thing from you. Now in those sarees, most of the sarees, there might be a blouse piece. So you can leave the blouse piece behind, so they'll get it stitched for you and also they'll get you a petticoat to match with it. That can be managed before Ganapati Puja. You must also leave your exact, I would say the exact measurement. Now the boys who want to have silk dhotis for their marriage should give their names to Me, so that we can get some nice silk dhotis. But as I said, they are rather expensive. Not very much, but they are. I have no idea of the price just now. So we can get. Those and the color you want of the dhotis. Anybody who wants to buy dhotis which are colored silk ones, please let Me know. Also there are boys who may be wanting to have a silk kurtas done. But I think if you go in the market you might be able to get yourself of your own size. Would be better. Oh, aage kya? Towels? O ka hai? Rakhye hai? Hai? Now. Tomorrow we are going to get you a barber to help you. Plus, I'll be sending the towels. I'm sorry I could not include that in the price. Oh, they are 30 rupees each. About 30 rupees each, but very good towels, cotton towels. I hope somebody has collected money for the sarees and for the pajamas and the kurtas. Who has done that? No. No people have been working. This is something for a person who is having Bachelor's degree, who has stars at home, he wants to collect który shlok, and very . It is my bitmuch pleasure to listen to everything you just have said. It touch me a lot. I think that you are my spirit, appetite, motivation, whatever we have one of the things that is your training, which is the self, which Everything has been given to you, Hmm? Ornaments. Hmm. Ornaments. He has got, how many? Sixty-five marriages. Seventy. But they might be having. About seventy marriages will have ornaments. And those who want to have extra, those who are not marrying and want to have ornaments, have to give the money to Mr. Bhikkhu Deva, and every set costs you eight hundred rupees. Eight hundred rupees to Mr. Bhikkhu Deva. When you are purchasing from him in Ganapatipule, will have to give him eight hundred rupees. Hmm. Hmm. That's all. What else? Any other business? Any other business? No. Bhagdaan? They have also got some shawls for you in the kitchen. Shawls for you if you want to buy. They have some shawls here, starting from about hundred and forty rupees to four hundred rupees. On Kashmir shawls with embroidery. So you can have a look at them tomorrow with the sarees, after the puja. Hmm. May God bless you. Hmm. Hmm. I have nothing to do there because you estimated the month when you bought Mecca. That's why you became rich,hertz,jihs, it's never wrong. Why not? Because now you can apply for P Paint montage as it has to get picture, yes. That charcoal-br situated from Arun proposed his photo. Yes. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . So this is to wish you a very happy Christmas and also a very prosperous Christmas. Joyous New Year. And I hope this New Year will bring forth many more Sahaja Yogis through you and that all of you will ascend once for all to that state of highest and highest. May God bless you. May God bless you. May God bless you. May God bless you.

My dearest brothers and sisters from all over the world, I welcome you on behalf of Bombay Sahaja Yoga on this most momentous occasion. A starlit evening, the new moon which marks the auspiciousness, a symbol of Lord Ganesh, the tunes of Shehanai, again auspicious, which heralds the beginning of the most auspicious puja, and the good news that Shri Mataji has arrived. All goes so well on the first year of 1987. So may I start this program wishing everyone of us a very happy new year. Happy not only for your personal life, happy not only for the state you are living in, happy and merry not only for the country which you represent, but more importantly, for the spread of Sahaja Yoga, expansion of Sahaja Yoga activities. And may I wish all of you a real jolly good time as far as Sahaja is concerned. Lots of new news is coming. Our brother from Calcutta who is here has brought very good news which Shri Mataji will announce. And I think the new year has started really well, which signifies that her grace is really behind all of us. And Shri Mataji has just come to Ganpati Kula smiling and she is so eager to meet all of you that I think she is even resisting to talk to her dear daughter who is also with her and is meeting her after a long time. So she is with her right now and very shortly she is coming here to meet you and it appears that she has even postponed the procession program which has been arranged by the village.

So let us look forward to this. Now you have just heard a Shehenai recital from one of the Nagpur Sahaja Yogis and one Mr. Gayakwar who all of us are very familiar with. He has just played Ragh Kalawati here. Next to him accompanying him is Mr. Bakshi on Tabla is Mr. Dhokke and the other one who is accompanying him is Mr. Mishra. Baba Mama as promised by him last year has brought lots of musicians and we are really looking forward to a very good program for the next four days. Now Mr. Gayakwar will continue his Shehenai recital and we wait the arrival of Shreemata Ji. While passing may I make one comment which Shreemata Ji has made last year when we celebrated her birthday at Bombay. She now feels that your Kundalini would be raised and you all will be able to enjoy the collectivity in the midst of the music. She has asked me to tell you that the next three or four days musical programs by the professional musicians known in India as well as by Sahaja Yogis is meant to bring the collectivity and to have you all of you really in the real depth of the Sahaja Yoga.

Shreemata Ji has asked me to convey you that these musical programs should not be taken as a part of the entertainment. You can get this entertainment anywhere but while the musical program is on either whether it is Shehenai, Sarod, Sitar, vocal and you are going to hear lots of them thanks to Shri Baba Mama here. I will go through the entire list a little later maybe in the presence of Shreemata Ji but let me tell you one thing while the music is on your Kundalini must have already pierced the Brahma Rantra and you should all be able to find collectivity. It is not meant that you should be on and look forward for the time when it would be closed and let me assure you that this time we are going to play real professionals in the evening and I am sure that you will enjoy it. In the mornings we will have our Sahaja Yoga musical recitals. Therefore the evenings Shreemata Ji has taken care, Shri Baba Mama has planned and we all have agreed that the evenings will be spent listening to the music program enjoying it and it will be presented by the most professional people available in India today.

May I need to tell you what Shehenai is meant for and what Shehenai does? I think everybody by now knows about it. We will also have Sarod recitals, Sitar recitals, vocals. Then we have many Sahaja yogi friends also here who have composed poems. They will be presented to you. There will be Kavali's presented to you. Another Indian style of presenting a Bhakti Rasa. So everything will be presented to you. May I therefore urge all of you to be very careful to see that you are your vibrations wise you are alright and that you find yourself in the collectivity. With these brief comments I request our friend Gayakwar to continue the Shehenai recital. And I have also from Nagpur, these musical colleagues who have come here, all our friends, they have also conveyed their greetings to you. Now I would request Baba Mama to speak a word before we continue the recital on Shehenai.

I understand a little longer, a little distance from the camera so that he can photograph me. Thank you Mark. Well, this is to wish you all a very happy new year. As Mr. Pradhan has said, it is a very auspicious day and it has become more auspicious because of your auspicious presence to me. I am flattered to say the least that the artists I bring have been classified as professionals. I may tell you that most of the artists here, though of course they are quite proficient in their art, but they are primarily Sahaja Yogis. And that is what draws them to Ganpati Koi and it is the love that binds you and them together. This time I have made an addition to the program that I had given to you last year. I am bringing on Saturday the third one, very imminent artist, Mr. Buddhaditya Mukherjee. He is known as Pandit Buddhaditya Mukherjee. Pandit means who is the master. He is ranked among the first five sitarists in the country. We will be here on the third to entertain you and also prepare you for the marriage on the fourth. So I am sure you will get sufficient inspiration when you please.

Then I will be having two youngsters who have come from Nagpur. One person plays the tabla, the other plays the guitar. Then of course we have the name table Mr. Dhatli. Then I have got inspired to compose a few poems in Urdu and in Hindi and in Bharati. That is the blessing of Shimatha Ji after I have come into Sahaja Yoga. And those have been put to tune by Mr. Dhatli and they will be also rendered here before this progress to our audience. Now may I ask the artists from Nagpur, I think they have come here to come closer to me as Mr. Gayakwad continues his recital. Thank you. Mr. Dhatli and others may I request them to come closer to me. Have they come? They have not come. Mr. Gayakwad is now playing Bhageshvi, one of the favorite ragas of Shimatha Ji.

The only antidote was this, gradually. The appreciation to your class is established. Thank you very much. Now, bringing before you young and budding artist, Makho and his brother, Prasad and Sandesh. Prasad is going to play the guitar. This is quite popular in the western side. He is going to play Indian classical music on the guitar. He is going to play the Raja Bihar and accompanying him would be his brother, Sandesh Popatkar. The Popatkar family is known in Makho and one of his uncles had settled out in London. He was playing for the BBC in London and thereafter he was performing regularly in London. Unfortunately, he suddenly demised recently. I would like you to welcome these artists with a big clap. Thank you. He is going to play the Hawaiian guitar to suit the Indian style of music. He is playing Raja Bihar on the Hawaiian guitar. Thank you.

Thank you. We will recommend this concept to all of you. I would say it's a real honor.

We have started everybody has to dedicate and Has to work hard and has to be all the time on the move to see that Sahaja Yoga is established properly in this country and abroad Once it is established in Australia, it will spread everywhere after all it has to happen in Muladhara to begin with May God bless you We'll have to take down some of your you might have to extend this way I So what's all the program now today We have a Slower presentation mother just called visions Yes, yes And then some music all right I My What are we doing with this? We'll see the... It's a slide with the accompanying sound. Let's have it. Just for a change the lights are off. I might have turned around now. It's a group. It's an exercise. What is happening to the end? You can put out this one also. This one up too. Alright. We have the light off at the back where you're sitting too. I'll do it this way. What's happening to the end? There's a whispering going on. Put out that light. We're using it to operate the radio script. We're using it to operate the radio script. We're using it to operate the radio script. We're using it to operate the radio script. We're using it to operate the radio script. We're using it to operate the radio script. We're using it to operate the radio script. We're using it to operate the radio script. We're using it to operate the radio script. We're using it to operate the radio script. On or back we must stop. Just stay here. Just stay here. Just stay here. To the goddess who among all created beings stands firm with the form of mother. Reverence to her. Yay, reverence to her. Reverence to her. Reverence. Yay, reverence. At the hour of dawn he shall gaze upon the rising sun and greet with joy his earthly mother. At the hour of dawn he shall wash his body in the cool water and greet with joy his earthly mother. At the hour of dawn he shall breathe the fragrant air and greet with joy his earthly mother. And the heavenly father is light. Even that light which is a thousand suns, a thousand times brighter than the brightness of a thousand suns. Enter the holy stream of light that the shackles of death may lose their hold forever. And breaking free from the bonds of the earth, ascend the holy stream of light through the blazing radiance of the stars into the endless kingdom of the heavenly father. And I saw the heavens open and beheld the white horse. And he that sat upon him was called faithful and true. And in righteousness he thus judged. His eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns. And he was cloaked in blazing light and his feet were bare. And his name is called the word of God and the holy brotherhood followed him on white horses. Clothed in fine linen, white and clean. And they entered the eternal infinite garden. The spirit of the baby never dies. It is called the mystic female. The door of the mystic female is the roof of heaven and earth. Continuously, continuously it seems to remain. Draw upon it and it serves you at ease. The tower that can be told of is not the absolute tower. The names that can be given are not absolute names. The nameless is the origin of heaven and earth. The name is the mother of all things. For to think upon her is perfection of understanding. And he that wakes for her, say, will soon be without care. For she goes about seeking them that are worthy of her. And in the paths she graciously appears to them and in every thought she comes to meet them. For the truest beginning of her is the desire for instruction. And care for instruction is love for her. And love for her is keeping her laws. And adherence to the laws, the assurance of immortality. And immortality makes to be near unto God. So then the desire of wisdom leads to a kingdom. If you then delight in the thrones and sceptres you despots of the nations, honor wisdom that you may reign forever. That day shall we set the seal on their mouths, that their hands will speak to us and they will feed their witness to all that they did. Therefore I say to you, love your true brothers in the will of God a thousand times more than your brothers by blood. And then shall the sons of men like true brothers give love to one another, the love which they receive from their heavenly father and from their earthly mother. And they shall all become comforters of one another. And disappear from the earth all evil and all sorrow, and there shall be love and joy upon the earth. And then shall the earth be like the heavens and the kingdom of God shall come. On the shores of Brarat where many of all races have come together, awake on my mind, standing here without stretched arms, I send my salutations to the God of humility, and in solemn chant sing his praises. At whose call no one knows came floating streams of men and merged into the sea of Brarat, the Arian, the Non-Arian, the Dravidian, the Huns, the Pathons and the Burgals. They all have merged here into one body. Today the west has opened its doors and from thence come gifts, giving and taking. All will be welcome on the shores of Brarat where men of all races have come together. The mad exultations singing songs of victory have they come, crossing deserts and mountains. They all dwell within me and in my blood echo their varied melodies. O terrible one, let the heavens resound with your music, even those whom in disdain we kept apart will gather round thee, O Brarat, where men of all races have come together. Here one day in the hearts of men, the message of the one resounded, in the fire of Tapasya all differences were forgotten and the many forged into one. Round that fire of sacrifice we all have to meet with bowed heads and unite on the shores of Brarat where men of all races have come together. In that fire the bloodshot flame of suffering is aglow. O mind, bear this suffering and hear the call of the one. Conquer all shame or fear and let vanish all humiliations. What great life will emerge at the end of the days of suffering. The night ends. The great mother is awake on the shores of Brarat where men of all races have come together. Come, O Aryan and non-Aryan, Hindu and Muslim, come, O English and your Christian, come, O Brarat, purify your mind and grasp the hands of all. Come, O downtrodden and let vanish all burdens of your humiliation. Tare not, but come you all to anoint the mother on the shores of Brarat where men of all races have come together. My Lady, so gentle and pure when yielding salutations, by the way, that the tongue trembles and has nought to say, and the eyes which flare would see may endure, and still amid the praise she hears secure. She walks with humbleness for her array, seeing your creature sent from the heavens to stay on earth and to show a miracle made sure. She is so pleasant in the eyes of men that through the sight they are in a most heartless gain, a sweetness which needs proof to know it by. And from between her lips there seems to move a soothing spirit that is full of love, saying forever of the soul of Sai. As higher grows the flame, the more contended these by-wings, so every virtue that shines more bright, the more at ease by seeing it offended. My Lady, though you are divine by beauty, like a mortal thing you eat and sleep and talk among us all, how can this ever be? But should this doubt soon fall through all your grace and all your courtesy, would it not be the greatest sin to see your beauty and, alas, not follow you? For late man's thought, how true, can fall in love through that one eye alone which fails to see through merit of its own. Divinity made earth. Reveal yourself to me, just as I do my thoughts on sheet and stone. Oh, blank, until I give them what I own. What are those golden builders doing? Where was the bearing place of softer thinness? Near Tyburn's victory? Is that myl's irons' hills most ancient promontory, near Mornful ever weeping Paddington? Is that Calvary and Gargotha? Becouse I am the most ancient one. Is that Calvary and Gargotha? Becoming a building of pity and compassion? Lo, the stones of pity and the bricks well wrought affections and angry love and kindness and the tiles in graven gold, neighbour of merciful hands, the beans and rafters of forgiveness, the mortar and cement of the work, tears of honesty, the nails and the screws and iron braces are well wrought blandishings and, all contrived words, firm fixing never forgotten. Always comforting the remembrance, the flawless humility, the seeding's devotion, the hearts' thanksgiving. Repair the furniture, O Lambeth, in thy pitying looms, the curtains woven, tears and sighs, wrought into lovely horns, the comfort there the secret furniture of Jerusalem's chamber is won. Lambeth the bride, the lamb's wife, love of thee, plow at one with her, the noest not of self in thy supreme joy. Go on, builders in hope, but Jerusalem wanders far away without the gates of loss. Among the dark satanic wheels. The cloud does not know in this life, why it moves in such a direction and at such a speed. It feels an impulsion. This is the place to go now, but the sky knows the reason and the earth knows the truth. The earth knows the truth, the earth knows the truth, but the sky knows the reasons and the patterns behind all clouds, and you will know too, when you lift yourself high enough to see beyond horizons. Could you but see the tides of that breath? You would cease to see all else, and if you could hear the whispering of the dream, you would hear no other sound, but you do not see, nor do you hear, and it is well. The veil that clouds your eyes shall be lifted by the hands that wore it, and the clay that fills your ears shall be pierced by those fingers that needed it, and you shall see, and you shall hear. Yet you shall not deploy having known blindness, nor regret having been deaf, for in that day you shall know the hidden purposes in all things, and you shall bless darkness as you would bless life. The lotus. Do not go to the garden of flowers, or friend, go not there. In your body is the garden of flowers. Take your seat on the thousand petals of the lotus, and there goes upon the infinite beauty. The reason why I asked if there were another river was this. All down one long aisle of the forest, the undersides of the leafy branches, have begun to tremble with dancing light, and on earth I knew nothing so likely to produce this appearance, and I knew that there was no other way to make it happen, and I knew that there was no other way. As the reflected lights cast upward by moving water. A few moments later I realized my mistake. Some kind of procession was approaching us, and the light came from the persons who composed it. First came bright spirits, who danced and scattered flowers soundlessly falling, likely drifting flowers. Then, on the left and right, each side of the forest avenue, came youthful shapes, boys upon one hand, and girls upon the other. If I could remember their singing, and write down the notes, no man who read that score would ever grow sick or old. Between them went musicians, and after this, a lady in whose honor this was being done. But I have forgotten, only partly do I remember the unbearable beauty of her face. Is it? Is it? I whispered to my guide. I... she's one of the great ones. And whom are all these young men and women on each side? They are her sons and daughters. She must have had a very large family, sir. Every young man or boy that met her became her son. Even if it was only the boy that brought the meat to her back door, every girl that met her was her daughter. Is that a bit hard on their own parents? No. There are those that steal other people's children. But her motherhood was of a different kind. Those on whom it fell went back to their natural parents, loving them more. In her, they became themselves. And now, the abundance of life she has in Christ from afar throws over into them. I looked at my teacher in amazement. Yes. It's like when you throw a stone into a pool. And the concentric waves spread out further and further. Who knows where it will end? Redeemed humanity is still young. It has hardly come to its forest then. But while very there is joy enough in the little finger of a great saint such as Yonder Lady to await and honor the dead things of the universe into life. I have breached the inner vision, and through thy spirit in me, I have heard thy wondrous secret. Through thy mystic insight thou hast caused a spring of knowledge to well up within me, a fountain of power pouring forth living waters, a flood of love and of all embracing wisdom, like the splendour of eternal light. Can you see the vision, see the vision? Can you see the vision of the vision? The other party shall receive and travel the room. Can you see the vision of the vision? Can you see the vision of the vision? Can you see the vision of the vision? Can you see the vision of the vision? Can you see the vision of the vision? Can you see the vision of the vision? I know you are great, I know you are hand upon my place, and I know you are beautiful, the gaze of season full of tender praise. And shall your children find their ends in just one smile so sweet? Along with me our hearts will fill to touch the limit screen. Can you see the vision, see the vision? Can you see the vision, see the vision? Can you see the vision, see the vision? Can you see the vision, see the vision? Can you see the vision, see the vision? Wonderful. Very good. You have some last words. Who are these people coming? So give us a hand to people who did visions. Good idea. Is there a poem? I think there is a description. All of these persons are here. All of them. So should we get those things here? Five minutes job. You can take him, you know better. Certainly I start getting the fragments. We are very thankful to people who came all the way to England to work in Shudicam, and the dedication and coordination of people, organization of the whole work, the way they showed it is so remarkable. And I couldn't bring anything from India much, so I've got something for them to be given. Thank you. You see the load of their obligation on English Sahaja Yoga is so great that this is nothing. One more you have. Frank isn't here. This is for Frank. He has gone to... Oh I see. It's sad that we have to get something that is Chinese. Because English can't make such beautiful things in any case. And now if they are making anything good you cannot bring them here because of the customs. So now for the children, put it on this one. Now which is the next one, one by one. Just have a look. This one is for Frank. Can you keep it here, second one? And that one, that's the one. Yes. One for Fogarty is that one, I think the other one is for Fogarty. That one is for Fogarty. Now that one is for Fogarty. Yes, this one is. This one is for... This one has to go. So now you've got the fourth one also, isn't it? So put it there. It's a little at random so you shouldn't mind anything. Now, you can ask once to follow. The eldest one is for Fogarty. The microfogarty please come forward. This is for one who is chosen. It's in the beauty of it. See, we didn't have much choice. And of course, the other one. I think you could give this one, you would prefer this one, I think. You better that one if you want to. Frank, yes. Then you put it there, so you give one. Because see, it goes better with that one. With that one, this one will go better. So, that's the elephant for you. Yes. He's not like, where will I put them? Now, I don't know but you better take it and you can keep it outside if you like. This one is for him. So, let him, just take it, alright. I'll touch it, that's all. I've touched all the elephants already. May God bless you. Just put this underneath your arm. Alright, keep it for the time being here, doesn't matter, they look quite alright as they are. Alright, now. Second one is for, may God bless, for Frank. This one. That one, yes. Yes, that one for Frank, yes. So, this would be for Frank. I mean, I don't have forgotten the future. I think that was the original one. That's the children's one, this one, yes. This one for Frank is better, it's much more mature. So, this is for Frank Garnasi, who's in Perth, we'll mail it to him. Alright. I'll take it with me when I go. I'm going up in about six to seven weeks, mother, and I'll take it. Alright, yes, alright. So, what is the painting, you just show Frank's. Yes. It looks nice if you put a light behind it, it looks much better. Alright. Thanks for your help. This goes with that, this is grey colour, yes. This is greyish, yes. You see, you could go with that, more grey in that. More grey in that. Yes, so this would be. So, which one you have given to him? One you have given to him, then this one to him, yes. This is the second one. This one goes with, let us write in a fugarity, this one will be Frank, alright? Now, now, that's for Frank. Alright, now that's one for Paul. Paul Hynn would please stand up. Thank you. Thank you. You can't imagine with what dedication they did the job and the Sahaja Yoga, the way they were witnessing the whole thing. Their witnessing power was so tremendous. We were surprised, you see, the way they were witnessing the whole thing, so beautiful yes, that's the one, yes. Just turn around, okay? Turn around, it's upside down. Tremendous, I mean, they were real Sahaja Yogis, working like nobody's business. See this one is nice, with flowers. Alright, this one. This is also signed by the artist they said, the artist has signed it. God knows if it has any. Alright, now that one goes with that, isn't it? The third. This one, yes, these three are done. Now this one for him. Well, Robert Weber, please stand up and come forward. Other way, other way. He being the youngest. Just show that way. This is also signed, see? You happy, Robert? Thank you. Thank God. I'm sorry, this was the thing to express how you were building there in Shuddhi Camp, with that childlike spirit. Wonderful, I mean, they gave such a lesson to a lot of them, really.

Whatever we may do now, they will not object. They are very happy, the way all things were done and the way you gave all the maps and everything, they are very happy about it. They said, we have never seen anybody taking so much trouble to renovate an old house like this. This is, this house was first established in ten thousand, so you can imagine what old house it is.

It is like the shiva. Yes, it is typical Austrian consciousness. Very much. I find sense in this. He's been finding this conditioning for years, hopelessly. You can't have anything else with this. I mean, it fits very well. It goes well. This is a yoghurt cake, something like a crack cake. This goes well with coffee. Yes, I mean... It is tasty. It is tasty, I mean. It is a question of developing a particular taste, is the point. Condition. Now I need to... This potato salad. And salad. You must drink coffee. They always drink some water in between cold water. Cold water. That's very bad. Really? Because she must be like this. You just said it yesterday, they must be doing that. That's why it's bad. You see, their hums are so bad. Does it? I didn't know this either, Shri Mataji, but you just mentioned it to me yesterday. Shri Mataji, in general, the Vietnamese kitchen is not healthy at all. It goes straight to the leather. We eat too much, we like cakes, we like too many coffees per day. I mean, generally speaking. It is heavy to develop because if you drink the coffee, you have some bitter taste in the mouth. And so you have a sip of cold water to get this bitter taste out. So they drink coffee and water. But then why take the bitter? Because they don't drink so much sugar with it. The way they made it, about 300 years back, they started to drink coffee. And somehow the way they did it, the lemon needs sugar from the beginning. And also the way they cooked it. But then you can have a lighter coffee. They don't cook it like Indians, just people. This is the national coffee. This is our coffee. First they got it from the Turkish people. When they came here for the war, the Turkish people, the coffee was left here. So they had hot coffee and cold water and hot coffee? Because they cooked only the coffee, the water and the coffee powder. No milk in it. Just a lot of coffee powder and water. So it's very strong, very bitter. And then the start of this heavy was the cold water. So every now and then, if they serve coffee, they have to bring in glass of water, is it? No? In Maharashtra also they serve, but you have the glass of water first and then you have your tea. That's how they do it. Exactly like this they do it. Now you said in this one lecture we stopped the time but if he printed in this booklet, we are so envious. That's what they do all the time. Was it bad? No, they did it on themselves only. The allergic one can become? Yes. And then we have left love it. The European people, most of them have left love. But from where does this knowledge come from? Turkey? It's supposed that the coffee drinking came from the... But Turkish people are not known for their wisdom. Nothing to learn from there. I mean the kids here for war. They are turkeys then. They left all their bad habits with them. The Turkish coffee was left. Turkish coffee? They call it kava. They call it kava. Kava? Kava. They have a very small cup and they heat it with a long thing and they just toss it down the throat. Even in Kashmir it's very popular. This is Turkish people. Arabs actually. They started this tradition. I think people living in hot country drink a lot of coffee in India. South India? Yes, South India. But not North India. Don't take coffee. I think if I may suggest that you rest a little bit. I think it's always so pleasant to be here at our place and to be able to give you a present from the people of Kaisenfried and in an audience. I think that's the thing after this. We must write the name of the place here. Because I have not been able to yet pass the word properly. Yes. How do you spell it? G-L-V-I-S-S-E-N-F. You didn't know? L-V. I think it's a shining field. Shining field. The name of the place means a shining field. Yes. What is this? It's a cut stone. Cut stone. From two eyes here. What is that? Nose. Yes, yes. Wait until you find this. It's like a tapestry. Yes, yes. Both sides. Nose is so clear. Can you see the nose it will be? The white. Here is the nose, you see. And here is the thing. You see from the front, you know you see it better. Nose as it is. These are the lips. Little should have been. It's very surprising. And the eyes look really like eyes, you see them. You see them inside? Where did you get such a beautiful face? It's a place called Bernstein. It's a place where you dig old stones out. But this is not imported there. But this comes from Brazil. From Brazil? This is quartz, isn't it? Quartz stones. It's something like this. It's a great language. How are you? I'm fine. Is it beautiful? Yes, it is. Wow! It's a great feeling. It's a great feeling. Listening to it. But this is remarkable. No. Was it in this? Yes. You have to think a stand for it to look nice. Put it on a stand. It's a... Transparent. Transparent. Okay. Look at the confidant. Hello! Come here! Come here! Wow! She's living here. Who will take this? You come here. She's not a cheat. This is the daughter of the... of Mantra and Thelumni who are living here. And he's not yet baptized. And she still has... She's not baptized. What's your name? Marlene. Marlene. Marlene. Marlene. Marlene. Marlene is her name. Because there are lotuses we call her Kamala. The name of Lakshmi. Kamala. Kamala is your name. So I think we are going to have wonders out of photographs you have taken and out of the film you have taken. How do you find the camera is good? Yes. Good, eh? Very bright. Is that the latest or something missing? It's a little bit heavy if not the sun is high. But better than the ones we have. Yes, not bad. But you can get even lighter than this? Yes, the newest model. But this is very very popular. Because it's easy going. It's complicated and easy going. Ah, that's it. The more latest it becomes, it becomes complicated. So still you see many plastic parts and also then... But sometimes you can put it on a tripod. Yes, I have it on. They haven't got one. I didn't have it because I already had so many things. We had a tripod. We'll send it. You see it's appropriate now. For Guru Puja we'll send the tripod which is with this camera. To Andhura. Guru Puja will send it. That's a tripod but he was saying that you see he has to carry. Since that is so he'll avoid it. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for the lunch. Thank you. Thank you. Shri Mataji, we have prepared lunch for you. Maybe tea later. Just a little bit. I have a full light. I'm eating it. Alright. What are you saying? I'll have tea later when it's a better idea. Because as it is I have no room in my stomach. Alright, let's see other room. You see. Why don't you sit down? It'll be better. Shri Mataji, we have prepared one more song. We have prepared one more song if you... No, no, I would love to hear. I'm expecting. Then give me the paper also. Thank you. Very little you should ask him to give me for food. Yes, just few. Yes.

She was also with, she was there in Italy? Yes. Yes? Yes. See because these frogs I have given, that's why I want to. Yes, yes. Here you can see the tree to come, because it's taking hours. Yes, yes. Stay here, come. Don't run away. Come. They're such nice children, they're five seconds old. Yes. Oh, you are wearing short-hour flowers? Yes, ma'am. Very kind of you. They are standing behind you on an empty seat, so you can have the fragrance of flowers. It's like a very, very, very exciting. I'm so excited. I must thank your husband for going to the movies and we all this, it was very well done. He will go again, mother. For an extra round. By that time I can also go next year. Sorry. Here you go. Hello. Thank you very much. How about a mouse, please? I'm sure with your knowledge, you'll be very happy. Also I've seen sometimes you don't even laugh at them and they say something. Or sometimes we say in the language of chakras, then they get upset. I think these people are saying something secretly, I guess. So you shouldn't say something like that. Among yourselves you shouldn't talk, like these sometimes you talk. So they feel hurt. Should we all open, expose it? You should feel that we are having such a mischievous constant such a thing. Even laughing at them or smiling at them. Even if it's a joke that you understand they do nothing, then they get upset. So there are new people, there are awareness issues coming up. And you should try to explain it to you to Peri. It's very important. We'll be nice if you can offer them some little food. I can place some bhajans, tapes or something. Even my tapes you can use to be given. So what? Some introductory tapes you can use and explain to them, tell them about it, what it is about. So they like it. That's how they are wanted. That's what they are. But if there is a kind of a solution, even slightest that you are higher than them or they are lower than you, they feel hurt. And she's not hurt. It's surprising how they come to Me, so many of them, when I am from them. And I don't know what happens to me. I think something in the photograph. Everywhere. Everywhere this is a situation. You go into any place, I just don't know. They have never known Me, they have never met Me, but something in the face perhaps. And there are few people coming. Maybe that there are very few who are really seekers. And they just want to see Me or meet Me, that's all. As there are many who just want to go to a Guru. We have been to Kshuru. What you have got is nothing. You have been to a Guru. The same way they think, oh, we have met better in their world. Then that there is something to be done about themselves or they have to become something, they don't see that. So you should mind it, because that's how they are. Gradually things will go from when you go and when they see the transformation in you, they will feel hurt. Why are we here from Catholic? Want to sing the song? They said they have taken permission, you can sing the song, all right? There is no singing here, but now you can sing. You will.

Now everything is very Artist venue Thank you Thank you. There are many more nights which are going to be young we do. So don't be in a hurry for kabali. We'll have many more kabali's. Shri Mataji has requested for the marwa. That is the first ghazal which Pelos wrote. Na kudakpo dukte, lok beach majdhaar dukte. Would you want the meaning also? Alright. Dara, kar shahid, shabda dera? This again was written in a train. This time the train had halted. And I was, if I am not offending the Bengalis, I was amongst the stinking ruins of Calcutta, standard, and I didn't know what to do. So I said, alright, I'll write. And this is what flew in. Yes. But this had stopped. It says, na kudakko dukte beach majdhaar dhunte. Na kudha is the navigator. In Hindi we say navik, or in Marathi we say navik. The navigator. The ones who are drowning in midstream, those who have been caught in the whirlpool, they always look for the navigator because out of selfish end. Then it says, because of survival also, thank you Shri Mataji. And it says, saki ko rind maya kade medhoonte. The ones who are habituated to drinking, they are all the time looking for the bar woman. That is how the concept in India is that the wine was being served by a bar woman who is known as saki. So that the people who are drinking are looking for the bar woman in the bar. Saki ko rind maya kade medhoonte hain kamsar ko nase beykhte ar dhoonte. Those who are the downtrodden, the afflicted and those who are deficient, they are being sought by the critics because also the non-believers. Those who believe in themselves and therefore they criticize. Those non-believers of God are seeking these downtrodden people. They are also all the time because they want to criticize them and advise them as to what is right and what is wrong. But we sahaja yogis, we are seeking the people who are seeking. We are after the people who are seeking all these things, we are after them. We are seeking those who are real seekers. Ham ko dekho kyam dhoonne walo ko dhoonte hain. Then the first answer is vatan parasti mein ham nasle ko mitane inta kam dhoonte. In the eyes of the poet even patriotism has to go to a particular limit. If you are going to kill somebody just because he happens to be enemy, according to the poet it is not a proper thing because patriotism is alright. But patriotism does not mean that you can kill your own breed. That is not the purpose of patriotism. Patriotism is to show your love for the nation but not to kill people. Is tabahi par siya sad dhan amno hamad, amno hamad hoonte. And on the foundation, such a weak foundation of hatred and mutual distrust, the politicians are looking for peace and tranquility, eternal peace. How is it possible? If the basis is... They boast of achieving total peace and tranquility. Where are the foundations? By perpetuating hatred and by perpetuating mutual distrust, this being the foundation, they are trying to bring peace. What is... what is... contradict manifestation? This is hypocrisy. Then it says bandho ko bhatkane zahit karishma dhoonte hain. Those who are false gurus, those who are alleged godmen, in order to mislead their devotees, they are looking for miracles. Bringing out bibhuti from their hand, bringing out a Swiss made watch saying that this is given by God. Now I didn't know Switzerland belonged to God. God lived there but I'm sure Shivataji, God was not giving wristwatches. Yes, some people's god live in Switzerland in the bank. Yes, so bandho ko bhatkane zahit karishma dhoonte hain. Ye karishma ham dikhaan hain bandho ka hai ma dhoonte hain. While people are... the... the godsmen are trying to create sort of confusion in the minds of the disciples by showing miracles. We are trying to show this miracle by merely your surrender, your honest surrender. If there is an honest surrender, the miracle is bound to happen. It is a fait accompli, it is coterminous. These two things are coterminous. If you are having a total surrender, your miracle is achieved. So one doesn't have to look to exterior for miracles. You have to look within for your miracle and that miracle is bound to happen. Shivataji has assured us and we have experienced that miracle. Gam zada ghabra ke gamse nijad dhoonte hain. Gam zada ghabra ke gamse nijad dhoonte hain. Ye belos zariya abke pyaar ki janat hoonte hain. Gam zada ghabra ke those who are afflicted by grief, those who are totally in remorse, in sadness, those people are... they are so... so much oppressed by their grief, that they want... they are seeking redemption from that grief. That they are not in the grief. Those people are... they are so... so much oppressed by their grief, that they want... they are seeking redemption from that grief. They are trying to get out of that grief. But while belos that Shivataji has created is trying to create a paradise through you people. Jai Shivataji. Jai Shivataji. He has been travelling for last 48 hours. And as Jose was saying, he was also practicing classical music involuntarily because of the jerks of the bus. So his voice is slightly affected. Nah-hoo-dah-coo Nah-hoo-dah Nah-hoo-dah Nah-hoo-dah-coo Nah-hoo-dah Nah-hoo-dah Nah-hoo-dah Nah-hoo-dah Nah-hoo-dah Nah-hoo-dah Nah-hoo-dah Nah-hoo-dah Nah-hoo-dah Nah-hoo-dah Nah-hoo-dah Nah-hoo-dah Doobhute Vicha Majidhar Doomdite Aaar Aaaar Aaaar Aaaar Aaaar Aaaar Aaaar Aaaar Aaaar Aaaar Aaaar Aaaar Aaaar Aaaar Aaaar Aaaar Dham sadah kabrakke Dham seh nijaa Doomdite Ye bellows Ye bellows Ye bellows Ye bellows Ye bellows Zariye apki Yarki jannat dhun dite Ye bellows Zariye apki Yarki jannat dhun dite Naah hoo daa kook doobute Vicha Majidhar dhun dite Saakki kook Rindhaar Saakki kook Rindhaar Maakka demi dhun dite Naah hoo daa kook Naah hoo daa kook Naah hoo daa kook I'm going to have just a little presentation of the beautiful gifts the foreigners have brought for the Indian Sahaja Yogis. And it's very sweet of them to have brought all these beautiful things for you, whatever was possible from all different countries. And whatever was available they have been able to bring it and luckily everything has reached safe. So I think we should thank them, so give them a hand. I mean if the foreigners want to be here they are welcome because they are the ones who have brought all these gifts and they should see the joy of the people who are here. But if they want to rest they can go and rest also, it's all right. And now I will tell you one after another. The first we'll have children, very small children up to say three years or four years at the most. Very small children if you have any. Or anybody who has small children can come. Without the child also we'll do. Bye bye.

She worked very hard. So the third one is the wife of Jose and she is still in Argentina, so I'll send her present to her, but you can give her a hand. She's worked for one year there.

And it is this joy that Shrimata Ji has come here today to teach us how to open and how to feel. Shrimata Ji has come here today to teach us how to open and how to feel. And it is this inner peace that will transform mankind from within that will transform the whole world. I will speak a little bit about the chakra system before Mother Kamsa. She will talk today I believe about specific chakras and about how the system works so you have a little bit of understanding. ShriWhy take care, take care. Otherwise I will be located in inside the Jerusalem. So, you see, we wasted lot of time yesterday on watches. I don't believe that people will argue too much, ask questions, discussions and oppositions. They will not believe. So, I believe that people will not believe. I don't believe that people will argue too much, and that they will not believe. And there is a body against it. There is a body that discussions are not going to give you that status of worry. Of status of worry, we have to go this morning. In the same way, we have to go this morning to focus on the yoga. One has to realise that it's a living process. And living process works out by itself. Now, if you want to sprout seed, the Mother Earth will sprout it. But if you argue with the Mother Earth, what will she do? So, the living process is not a play of works, it's happening. So, some relevant questions have come, meaning at all, and we should not waste our time in that. Now, of course, certain warnings I also have to give you. Certain warnings I also have to give you. Because there are many false people in this world who have come out, because there are so many seekers. It is all a money-making proposition. And humans cannot understand that for living process you cannot pay. How much do we pay to the Mother Earth for sprouting the seeds or giving the fruits? How much do we pay? Now, so we have to understand that if this living process has to take place, then it has to work out without any effort, without any money. So, that is why Christ has said that a rich man cannot enter into the kingdom of God. He has also said in His human that a camel can pass through the eye of a needle, but a rich man cannot enter into the kingdom of God. Through the eye, through the whole of the needle. A camel can pass but not the rich man cannot enter. So, how much do we pay to the mother Earth for sprouting the seeds or giving the fruits? The reason is those who are having money too much or power too much, they can or chase their masters. So, how much do we pay to the mother Earth for sprouting the seeds or giving the fruits? And those who can be purchased cannot be your masters, they are your slaves? There are people living on your money, cheating you and also they have no self respect. So, one has to understand all people who are, whether they are from India or from any country, if they are asking for money you must know their faults. I am telling this because many of them have asked about transcendental meditation. About ten years back I came across those people who suffered from transcendental meditation. This was the gentleman who was running an institution called the Five of Avesha in the United States. Some people believe that by reading some books you can achieve. How if you see that has it been done or has it been done? So, by reading some books there are people like, quite a few, I have seen like Jews, they make a small little Bible of time, but their Bible is still like they call it. And they cover it in that as well as I am putting it away. How would you achieve your second May 8th by reading all of these things? We have to be honest in our sin and alert. And must seek for our benevolence and not flail to the hands of these people who are just trying to exploit you. So you must know it's a living process and a living process works spontaneously in Sahaj. So now this knowledge has been given to you about the subtle centers we have and about the teachers. But even by listening to this knowledge you are not going to ascend. For that Kundalini has to rise. It has to connect you to the All-Pervading group. Now Kundalini is your mother. Everybody has an individual mother. And she knows everything about you. And she is just craving for a chance where she could meet somebody and she could rise like the sea, just like Mother Earth is proud. Now, Kundalini is the reflection of the Holy Ghost. Holy Ghost. And Holy Ghost is the desire of God Almighty. And God Almighty is our Father. He loves us more than any father can love us. He wants us to enter into the kingdom of God and enjoy His blessings. He does not want us to suffer for them. So this Kuda-yul is the one which is the pure desire that you have. The pure desire, the Kuda-yul is the pure desire. Kuda-yul is a self-arsodition, is the power of pure desire. All other desires are not pure. You want to buy a car, where tomorrow you want to buy a house, then you want to buy a car, then you want to buy a airplane, those are like that. In general, ones are not sexual. In general, ones are not sexual, it is a law of economics. The law of economics is that in general, in general, ones are not sexual. Desires are not sexual, they cannot be satisfied. In general, this is the only desire that you have within you, which is pure. And what is this desire is to be born with the root. Once this desire is fulfilled, then you become a transformed personality. This is what is known as the second birth. In Sanskrit language, a saint is called as Vijaha, and a bird is also called as Vija. Vija, mani twice born. Therefore, as Vijaha, a saint is called as a person who is born again, and a bird is also born again. In Sanskrit, a bird and a saint is called as born twice. In Sanskrit, a bird is born as a personality. Now, because first the bird is born as an egg, and then it becomes a bird. In the same way, a human being is born as a human being, and then with self-realization, he becomes one. In the same way, a human being is born as a person who is born again, and then with self-realization, he becomes one. Now the kindness comes for many people to get their realization. So what is realization in this that you become the Spirit? Now what is the Spirit? So the Spirit is the deflection of the God Almighty within us. So the Spirit is the collective being within us, which is the collective being within us. So if you become the Spirit, you become, again I say you become collective being. It's not just a certificate. It's not some sort of a badge, but you become in your central namma system. That means you can feel on your fingertips the centers of another person as well as your own centers. So the Spirit is the collective being within us. So the Spirit is the collective being within us. So the Spirit is the collective being within us. Now when the Spirit, the light of the Spirit comes in our attention, our attention becomes enlightened. Then what happens to us that we, supposing we are somebody's holding a snake in the hand, and we tell that person holding a snake, but it is darkness, so he says, no, this is the rule. He will say, I believe, I know, which is the law. He won't listen to me. But when the light comes, he'll throw it away by himself. So what happens to us when the light comes? It's not like you tell him. In the same way, when you get enlightened, you give up all the habits which I can say to him. You become a free, strong personality. Your attention becomes extremely compassionate and dynamic. And your eyes become innocent. There is no breath and lust in your eyes. And they become so powerful with love, that such a person, even with a glance, can bring in peace and healing in another person. Then this attention becomes the source of knowledge. Absolute knowledge. You put ten children who are realized souls and guide their eyes and ask them to say, what is wrong with this person? You take ten children and they are either the person, or what is wrong with this person before them. I don't realize that you are there. The question is, how do you feel about the person who is sitting before you and has no problem in this center? This center is the Vishuddhi Chakra. Now to pure descent. You have to put your fingers in your ears and right back your head and you have to say Allahu Akbar. This is the center of Akbar. Now we have aspects of God like His pilani, He is Akbar, He is a him and he is a kalim. Tananam Pithim is giving picture of Yusuf Akbar, Ilani Tesh Akbar, Raman Vaira Hintesh. He is not like one rock of Gibraltar. He has aspects. As a father, he could be a brother and a grandfather and a son. So when this spirit comes into your being, your attention becomes dynamic. You become very creative, very creative and you start creating new ideas which people are surprised. When you are in the center of your body, you become very creative and you become very creative. You become materially alright because you know how to achieve a proper balance in your material and physical life. The physical life is very important, the physical life is very important and the physical life is very important. And the divine power also helps. The ancient Tananam Pithim has a very strong sense of the story. In the countries where they have black matter too much and negativity, it can never prosper materially. Now I think it is in Islam said that one should not drink because it goes against our awareness. But we can just do it after self-realization. We just don't do it. I mean we are not trying to drink. I never tell you don't drink, I never say don't smoke. Just do that, don't do it. Because no habit can overpower you. You become so powerful. So the second thing that happens to you, that your attention wherever is put, and basically you will watch is the problem. Attention, we put it to anyone. You can find out about anyone who wants to find out. One of you think that. No, no, no, no. I said if you put attention to somebody who is not here, you can find out. I think that if you are a person who is not here, you can find out about anyone who is not here. Now if I say that Heather Palmer was an incarnation of the primordial master, some people who are not Muslims may not believe it. But if they realize so, then just ask them to think that they will know the vibrations we start from. So everything can be verified. Because Hadrad Bormath was very humble, he didn't say anything about himself much, and he didn't say what he was really, how great he was. But with this attention, you can find out about all of them. If somebody is a false person, you can feel the heat on the fingertips. And if he's Italian, you can even feel glisters on your fingertips. So everything you can find out for yourself. It is so simple because you become the instrument of knowledge. So you know the truth. You know the truth because you become the spirit which is the source of truth. Now there are 36 nations where Sahaja Yoga is working. And we have people who are of all religions who are in Sahaja Yoga. They all say the same thing. There's no quarrel of any kind. Never. There you meet about 3000 people from various places, from different languages, and all of them just enjoy each other. This is the first time you enjoy another little bit. This is the first time on the interval stay another little bit. There is no rivalry, no jealousy, no backbites, nothing. So such a beautiful human element is created. They burn it in summer, very silent times, between Sunday and Sunday yoga. So that the second one is the point that you become the spirit and you enjoy. And you become a witness. You see everything like a drama. You are not involved in it. You become a witness and you see everything. You are not involved in it. And then you can solve your problems better. Not only that, but you just start like dissolving into the ocean of joy. About all when you enter into the Kingdom of God, every step you feel there is said, the wrap will happen. Every day you feel there is somebody who is telling you, nourishing you, looking after you. Apart from your physical health, your fruits, your fruits, your soul, your soul, your soul, your soul. Mainly you feel so peaceful within yourself. And after some time you become empowered and you can utilize this to others. You can heal people. You can do all kinds of things which can be called as veratas. So this is the thing we have to achieve. That is the aim of human awareness. You have to achieve that status. And I am very happy that I go to Turkey and I found so many of you who are seeking that. And that it has worked so well with so many of you. Yesterday we spent a lot of time in asking questions and answering them. But that's not very healthy because as I told you, it is worse. You cannot work out anything. During the last two years you have been in the hospital for a long time. It was the first day so I said, all right, let's see what your questions are. Because after all, while you are doing your meditation, I don't want you to start asking you questions. You can also ask your own questions. So the meditation is the mark. At that time I hope nobody will ask you to get photographs and restore the people with their flashes. And what should not try to act this for nothing at all? What should not try to act this? If you want to have your realization, you cannot have it. I cannot force it on you. I cannot even force my ideas involved. And whatever I may say is not necessary that you get realization by what I say. Whatever I may say, but it's not why we are talking that you get realization. You have to get it. So there should be no quarrel about it. So now I think we should have directly the experience of self-realization. If I don't want it, you should go because I can't force it on you. Now I would request you very kindly, if you want to come in front here, or you can come and sit here. If you want to have your realization, come anywhere. If you want to have your realization, come and sit here. Please be quiet. Please be quiet. Please be quiet. Please be quiet. Please be quiet. Please be quiet. Please be quiet. Please be quiet. Now if you have any questions you have read, ask, question to Me outside or go to question event. Keep it without any questions. Please, can we come quickly and please. Now I have requested you better take out your shoes, we'll be able to bag the answers. I have come to reach for this, so I reached out. Now, you have to cut your left hand towards Me as I told you yesterday. And right hand we have to use for giving nourishment to our centers. The left hand is the desire power, not the pure desire but the desire to get Self-realization. So, it's not the right hand. It's not the right hand. And the right hand is to be used for giving nourishment. In a sense that you have to nourish your centers with your right hand, it is for action. So, we have to first of all put your hand on our heart. Because the Spirit resides in our heart, and then we have to put our hand in the upper portion of our problem. Which is the center of our mastery which is created for us by prophets. Now, you have to put your right hand in the lower portion of your problem. Now, you have to put your right hand in the lower portion of your problem. Which is the center of pure knowledge of divine laws. Now, again you have to take your hand in the upper portion of your problem. Now, again you have to take your hand on your heart. Now, you have to take your right hand in the corner of your neck and your head and draw your head through them. Now, you have to understand that this is the center, this part of the field. Now, you have to put your right hand on your forehead cross and press it on both sides. This is the center of forgiveness. Now, you have to put your right hand on the back side of your head and push back your head on it as which I think we are. And here for your satisfaction you have to ask for forgiveness from the Divine. Now, you have to stretch your hand. Now, you have to stretch your hand. Now, you have to stretch your head and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area. It is a soft bone in your child. This is very important. You push out your fingers. Now, you have to stretch your head and press it on your scalp and move it clockwise seven times. That's all we have to do. But please remember that you have to push back your fingers nicely and push it up the eyes. It's not like this, but... That's important. All right. There are two conditions before we start. First is that you have to forgive everybody. So when you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything now. But if you don't forgive, then you pray to wrong hands, mentally. So just forgive everybody. Yesterday many people felt the heat when they came to me. I asked them to forgive. Then I felt it too. Now, second condition is that you have to forgive yourself. Now, second condition is that you have to forgive yourself. You are not to feel guilty. You should not judge yourself. You are not to feel guilty. So forget the past. These are the two conditions and the least majority of people if you are sitting on the chair, who put the feet apart from each other, when you are sitting on the ground, is all right. Now, we come for trouble. But you should not stretch your head too much, but you should stay straight. That's all. Now, you have to loosen your neck or something at the waist if it is tight for you. Now, also you have to close your eyes and not open them, delightingly. Then, you have to take out your respect. Take out your respect. You have to take out your respect. Then, please close your eyes. So you are not to feel guilty. You are not to feel guilty. Now, just lay over there. So now, put, please close your eyes. You are sensitive to the type of attention. Now, put your right hand on your heart. In the card, this is the card for yours. Left hand towards me like this. Here, you have to ask me a very important question. You can call me Shri Mataji or Mother. Ask the question three times. Push sorry your heart. Mother, am I the spirit? I name that, Ruhmir. Now, please take down your right hand. We are working only on the left hand side, so please take down your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Here you have to ask another question. Because if you are the spirit, you are also your master. I am the first human being to be a master. Please ask a question. Three times again, Mother, am I my own master? I am the first human being to be a master. Now, I have told you that I respect your freedom. This is the only thing that is related to the consciousness of the Lord. And I cannot force divine knowledge on you. I am the first human being to be a master. So now, please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen. And here you have to say, in your own freedom, Mother, please give me divine knowledge of pure knowledge six times. Because this center has got six petals. So, I am the first human being to be a master. When you say and ask for divine knowledge or pure knowledge, the Kundalini starts moving. You are the first human being to be a master. The Kundalini starts moving. Now, to nourish the higher centers with your self-confidence, put your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left side. Here now, with self-confidence, please say ten times, Mother, I am my own master. Buddha, petun bani nisve, anne bann kantikantamil avan siddhi, onkara. Now you have to know that the greatest truth is that you are a spirit. You are not this body. You are not this intelligence or emotions. You are not your conditioning or your ego. So you are the pure spirit. Now put your right hand on your heart. I am beautiful bhatkara saying, Mother, I am the spirit. Say ten times. Three times? Ten times. Now put your right hand on your heart. Okay. Now raise your right hand in the corner of your shoulder and your neck. And turn your left ear right. Here we have to say with full confidence, sixteen times. Mother, I am not it. Buddha, petun bani nisve, anne bann kantikantamil avan sushudhe landi, onkara. Twelve times. Twelve times? Sixteen times, okay. Okay. I say, Mother, I am sixteen times. Turn your left ear right. Mother, I am not charitable. Because, root is the ocean of love and ocean of forgiveness. And what are the mistakes you might commit that can be easily resolved in that ocean? Now take your right hand on your forehead across and put down your head fully on it and press it on both sides. And then, you can see the ocean of love. Here, I can see the ocean of love and ocean of forgiveness. This is the center where you help the funny mothers. How many times do you know the one from your heart? You have to say, Mother, I forgive everyone. I don't know how many times you have to say, Mother, I forgive everyone. This is the place where you have to say, Mother, I forgive everyone. Now, take back your hand on the back side of your head and push back your head on it. Here, you have to say for your own satisfaction that over divine power of root. Please forgive me just for your satisfaction. Please do not count your mistakes. You have to say, Mother, I forgive everyone. Again from your heart. How many times? Now, take your right hand on top of your head. How many times do you have to say, Mother? How many times do you have to say, Mother? I put the center of your heart on top of the fontanel bone, which was the soft bone in your child. How many times do you have to say, Mother? How many times do you have to say, Mother? How many times do you have to say, Mother? It is important that you push back your fingers. But you cannot. We are... pastramals of analysis. Please do it seven times. But fear again, I cannot cross your freedom. I am a child of the United States. I am a child of the United States. I am a child of the United States. So you have to ask for self-realization? I have been in the United States for seven years. So please say seven times. Mother, please give me self-realization. I have been in the United States for seven years. I am the one who has been in the world for years. Now, we state down your hands. And slowly open your eyes. Now, we state down your hands. And slowly open your eyes. And then you will take your hands. And now, put down your head. And put your right hand like this. And with the left hand, please see when your hand and see yourself. There is a pull, please, come out of your head. And pull, please, come out of your head. And with the right hand, please see yourself. Now, just put your left hand also. Now, your right hand.

If there is a pull, please, come in. And with the right hand. Now, raise your both hands and push them in the different direction. And ask Me a question. Mother, is this the cool breeze of the roof?

They are all saying that we want science to come here. They don't know what is their heritage. Our heritage is spirituality, not science. What have they achieved in science? They don't even know English language. And they have got no idea about science, nothing. But they think you people are coming from the country of science and you know what science has done to you. That's why you must understand that this country there is a kind of a stupid understanding about science. When the British were here we were sticking on to our own culture. Science has no culture and that's why you all have lost everything that you had and you are having all your social problems and this violence and all that. Because they are dealing with science they say there is no God. So then they can drink, they can do whatever they like, they can kill anybody as what is happening in the West. So these are few people here, not many, but still you must see that what is growing in this country is very dangerous. That's why I have to request all the Sahaja Yogis of India to work very hard to spread Sahaja Yoga so that these people will be controlled. They are very criminal type of people, very criminal. Only one of our Sahaja Yogis was killed by them in Bombay. They are very criminal type and I think gradually the government will take over and they'll be alright. They wanted to come on the stage because they can't arrange any program, they can't have people, nobody is going to attend to their program. So they wanted to speak from this stage. People said that we have not come here to listen to you, we have come to listen to Mother. So just imagine how the violence is now spreading in this country and how important it is to spread Sahaja Yoga. You all know very well what's happening in the West. They are saying that I must be taking money from you. Now is there anybody who can say that? It's the absurd thing I tell you. Just a kind of a funny aggression which has no meaning. So you should not really bother about these people because they are here. Tomorrow we'll see to it that we inform the police about it and we'll take them to task. I think we should carry some dogs with us. That's a good idea. If you carry some dogs they can attack them. Not we, we are not dogs. It's all a drama, you just see that. It has to go on in the history, let's see how people are. In a country where there is so much of culture, spiritual culture, we have such a heritage. They have no heritage of science. Now what are they talking about, I just don't understand. I think some of the doctors are afraid that if we start curing people out of Sahaja Yoga they might lose their jobs or they might lose their patience. But there are so many patients in this world and I told them yesterday that I am not going to treat all the rich people, let me treat only the people who are poor, who cannot afford to get cured. I told them very frankly but they don't want to listen because they are all drunkards. They are all drunkards and that's why they are behaving like this. Just like this they were shouting. So they cannot see us enjoying anything, that's the main thing. They can't see us enjoying anything and that is why it is important for us to understand that we are Sahaja Yogis. It's nothing compared to what people have suffered for religion in this country, for their goodness, for their righteousness. But I think the people in the village are the ones who have been paid. They have to drink alcohol and destroy everything. This is our religion now, nothing else. This is our politics and all this. The people who are poor, who will cure them? They don't see anything. They don't see goodness. What is the use of troubling the saints? They don't see goodness. When we are white, the saints should be seen clearly. I told them that I don't want to say anything like that. I don't want to break my bones. Then they sent another message. But it was nothing. They were scared. Then they sent another message. It was written in that message that you should explain everything to us and explain to us about Sahaja Yoga and how Kundalini awakens us. I said that earlier the doctors had already got an MD from three doctors. And these three doctors, they have not even fallen on the road, it takes a lot of effort to get an MD. And they are giving it to the Shastras. They cannot give it to all these people, but they don't think about it. Three children got an MD in Sahaja Yoga. Now what will happen to them? Again and again, I told all the people that I had told them not to come. But two or three people, they were so clear that we had blood cancer, Sahaja Yoga was good and life was good. So they got angry. Because they won't get anything from the doctors. They will be drinking alcohol. They are from the village. Look, they are your children. They are drinking alcohol and doing this. You should take this into consideration. Don't let these children get into such a mess. They will go to jail tomorrow. They will be thrown out. Our children should be made into a culture where they drink alcohol, throw stones and become such good people. The people in the village should also understand that our children are like this. I give them two thumbs and I make them right. If they get into such a mess, how will they be? I hope they have not beaten Yogi. Where did you go? Rangapur has a very special feature about it. You see, Ramadaswami, the master of, the guru of Shivaji, found the statue of Sri Rama, Sita and Lakshmana in this river, at this point, in the Krishna river. And this was such a remarkable thing. They didn't know how the statue has come there. So it was taken to a place called Chafal where they put it. Now Sri Ramadaswami had created lots of Hanumanas out of the Mother Earth. Lots of Hanumanas out of the Mother Earth. Now, you see, they are saying that it's better to go by buses, so they are going to call one bus by one bus. Some men should go. The men can go, few men. We'll go last. The Sahaja Yogis, men, have to go now by buses because the police is afraid that these people might try to trouble you. So they are going to get the buses here and you all should go in the bus. Now, all the men who are here need not go, but quite a lot of them, there's one bus coming, one by one, you go by bus. The policeman is going to look after you, all right?

It is Allow I secondly tackling this problem along with your Stupid She is not correct in your session. On the God-puhli you said that one has created all the peace for us. She is not correct in your session. Also in the Bible it is said that we should not take too strong place. We should not take too strong place and the wine which was prescribed, it has the great juice of the Hindu wine makes the great juice. I need to talk on this. Because You are too strong and YouJ 7 thick with periodets you give so much comfort, and so you give so muchuckle. Also telling me that this great Buddhists have now or the garnishes have that, I feel that. How can Christ or anyone under the same belt can take for alcohol which takes you away from your awareness? They always talk sense. But because they say that we are very, the converted part of the word is white and white doesn't mean in any way, any way.

I'll go home because it was an instant but I thought you always say that when you rot the thing. cubic One said, your prosperity and Matt asked Me about that So I made the water and made it into water for my life. This Thank you very much. plants is that you receive it. Understand, is it possible to relate to saints Is it? I think Ian is saying Pole You're the pole of causes You are where always the cheers. You should come todesign It all Ma'am, what are you saying to the State with you I don't know the saying, assays cannot be saved. That's one part of the work. What is the miraculous way to? That I don't know. It's not supposed to be miraculous. But miraculous are like this in the Kundalini, is the biggest miracle. We call this a marriage process. And in many people you can see the pulsation of the Kundalini and rising of it. Miraculous are not that you show somebody some sort of diamond or some sort of ash. This is no miracle. This is all mesmerism. Some people think that in the presence of certain people you just start jumping, making noises similar. That you can do anyway. And you can take some diamonds or something others, you can buy them up. These are all other things. These are not the diamonds. We have had a meeting of all the Sahaja Yogis today and when they put the photograph on everybody's head, there was light. The miracle is that it will get cured, Sahaja Yoga. It's a fact we have got it established now because two people have got everything. Two daughters have got everything. Two daughters have got everything. Also the miracle is that a person with a right forehead, suddenly overnight becomes absolutely from all backgrounds. And a very hot-tempered person becomes a very compassionate person, a transformation, a transformation into that. In Sahaja Yoga you mean when you make them into the kingdom of God, you find so many miracles. We wanted to publish a book but now we have such a fight with the dead dead. We don't know what it is, what God means. When you find so many miracles, you have to be very careful of your own self-realization. These may have been sick because they didn't know how to protect themselves perhaps. Now I have to tell you about the experience we have about the Holy Christ. When Christ was crucified, it was said that He died for all sins and He suffered to wash our sins. When He has suffered so much, why should you suffer not even for the name of Christ or in the name of God? Why should you suffer? It's a myth. He has already suffered for you. You are not going to suffer more. There are things about every incarnation. But to understand them in the right possibility, you must first have your Self-realization. Otherwise you cannot understand them. Otherwise you cannot understand them. If ordinary people could have a surprise, they could not have crucified them. What might it mean that human beings take falsehood much faster than the human beings? Because truth is very simple. And they don't want to accept something very simple. They want to do something out of the truth, like they are being spiritual sick. They wear funny dresses or they will be on the streets dancing, I don't know, all kinds of things they do. But Self-realization makes you absolutely normal. You do not take to anything abnormal. You do not take to anything abnormal. And when the people try to create drama, they understand that it's not normal. Understand that it's not normal. Because it is false and they won't cover it up. So those who are sick of some truth must be honest and must be sensible. And if they are still identified false truth, it's impossible to give them the truth. So first they should feel this way that, I haven't found the truth and I should find the truth and then only I will decide. All the phenomenists believe that they have found the truth. They are all lying and they think they have found the truth. And creating problems now, that's the main problem of the whole world. So what has to be very clear? What have I got out of it? What should I know? Somebody might say, please tell me, this guru or this man has lots of powers and miracles. So what? What did I do? Like this. So what did I do? As a Mother I would say that if you had something, you do it like person of that kind, then what will you get? You have been going to the jungle, you have been going to the church, you have been going to the mosque, you have got gurus, you have made money, gurus, everything. What will you get? This is due to innocence, people, innocence. But more ignorance and they start believing that what they are doing is alright. That is how they want to see the excellence all the time. But we should know what we will get. What our powers are manifestly? What has added to our awareness? How are we in a higher state? You should give certificate to yourself with knowledge, with sense. Moreover, you cannot pay for it. If you just take this point, I believe 99.9% people will be false fighters. After all, you should be for your relevance and for your higher state of awareness that you are seeking. You should not be just a fashion or because everyone is doing it, so I should be. With My husband, we have another life and I find all the same people, parties and the way they talk amazes Me. They say, I have met this guru, he is expensive but he is very true. Like I said, I went to Russia and they had one official name. So they cursed this Orthodox Church because I wanted to keep the Church, Orthodox Church. And the head of the church was a black order and he started talking about this church and all that but he said that, today we are having a fasting day so we cannot eat late. What he can say? And he drank so much that he forgot that we were sitting there and let him see us all. And when he went out in the car, his officers who were with us, Russia, they started laughing. And they said, is this the man of God? Then they told us that Zara wanted to have some religion because Russians had no religion. So they sent for Catholics, Catholics. And the Catholic priest said, alright, you can drink as much as you like but you can't marry a lady. They said, this won't work out for Me, three-four sides, this won't work out for Russia. Three-four sides. So they sent for Muslims. But you cannot drink. So they said, this won't work out, we have to drink, if it is a cold country we must drink, we can't drink for God's sake. So they sent for this Orthodox Church, Greek Orthodox. They said, you can drink as much as you like but I am biased as much as you like, only you must pay us well. That's all. So they adopted Greek Orthodox Church. Now can you please answer? So naturally I said, how can they do God? What is this? This is the design of Christ. I said, please don't judge Christ by these people. They will follow Christ. Get your Self-realization and then you will know what is Christ. So the most important thing is that you must get your Self-realization. Now if you want to find out escapes, they are very powerful. Now if you want to find out escapes, they are very powerful. Nobody can force you. But if you have any value, any respect for your own personality as a human being, you should all ask for Self-realization. Now we have already told you about the centers that are within us. Now we have already told you about the centers that are within us. But this power, who can be, which is in the triangular bone, called as center, when She rises, She nourishes all these senses on Her head. She passes through all these six centers. The lower center, if you see, is the center which looks out under heavy plexus, which looks out to a exclusion. And this is the center of your innocence. Innocence cannot get lost. It can be covered but it cannot get lost. Now when the Guru realizes, She passes through only six centers, so She does not pass through the lower center, which looks after even cells. So the nonsensical idea that the sex-based part of your ourselves is nonsense. Of course sex is a natural thing and has to be dealt in its own proper eliminations and understanding. But it does not give you an ascent. The Kundalini rises and when it starts rising, this center stops its activities completely, if there is no exclusion of the inner life. And it passes through, first of all, the first center which is called here, is actually the second center in the series, but it arises out of the third center, which is the lower, which is the solar plexus. Now the center which we call as second center is the center of Swadhisthana. Because from the disadvantage of Swadhisthana we get solar diseases. Today only I tell you about one center, how we get solar diseases out of the scoring of one center. Now the Swadhisthana chakra or the center has the main job that it will blesses your blessings in your brain when you think too much. It converts from the fat cells, creates those grey cells and those who think too much, this center has to work very hard for that person. Now when this center is working so hard, it detects its other duties. The other duties are to talk to the river, the pancreas, the stream, the kidneys and for the intestines. When it declares the river, the heat is created in the body. And with the stream you get diseases like asthma and ultimately the heart attack. Then when it declares the pancreas you get diabetes which is a common disease, other people who think too much. Now the people who think too much also are very lengthy and very much an ambitious. And the stream is the rhythm maker or we can call it, is the one that keeps the rhythm guys properly. And when one does emergency, it produces red blood capsules for emergency. And when one does emergency, it produces red blood capsules for emergency. But when it is detected because after the week I will be able to crack cancer. Then kidneys also get spoiled and get hydrated and it understands the very classification and work itself problems of a thinking person. So this center, only one center gives you so many diseases. But when the Kundalini rises, Shri Mataji says this center and you get cured of these troubles. This is only about one center, I am saying. Now there are six centers. Now the one center which is important is the center between the upper church and the upper church. This is one window of that, Shri Mataji. This is the center where the science tries. Now this center puts out two organizations called different engineering which create Kundalini's ego and Shri Mataji's work as human-good selves. So now when this center is enlightened by Christ, and nourished by Christ, then these two balloons collapse. That means our karmas, our conditionings and our ego collapse. And then this living area opens out and you get the full breeze of the Kundalini's coming in which is the Kundalini's piercing fluid. And that is how Kundalini can penetrate the subtle energy which is the energy of divine love. And when this happens your hands start speaking and you start feeling the cool breeze on your fingertips. And you also feel the cool breeze out of your head. Yesterday many people felt it. After this you have to just establish yourself. And you know all about it. For which you don't have to wait. After that you are alright physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually. So only here and only here you are seeking out strength. Whatever will you be doing, actually unless that is the situation you are not going to be satisfied. That is the last strength you are to achieve in our intuition. Once you get realization you become so dynamic, so intelligent and so compassionate that it is very easy, it is very easy to understand. Otherwise talking about God and religion and everything becomes useless because you have no connection. We pray to God but there is no collection. So the collection has to establish. That is very important. That is very important. So now we will have the actualization of the experience. Without experience no one is talking about it. But I must tell you at the very outset that you cannot be false one. If you want to have your realization you can have it. But no one can force it out. So all those who want to have their realization should stay here otherwise those who do not want that can go. You will be quite alright for us. Hardly attendance. And you don't have to do anything about it much. You don't have to pay for anything. Because it is your own. Only one can recognize the other. And that you can also enlighten what you are in that. Also we have a very good follow up program here where you can meet them again, look after yourself, your imagination and become masters in all. You don't have to pay for anything much at all. Only thing you have to give some time to yourself and to yourself to act. And then only you realize that Spirit is the source of joy and the source of absolute truth. It is a collective being so all of you know the same thing. There is no argument. And when the life of the Spirit comes to your attention it is effective and it acts. Acts for your benevolence and acts for benevolence of others and that is how the whole place can change and can become very beautiful. And we can achieve emancipation of the human beings and solve all their problems. We can achieve the same thing. We said in our question, we will know what is the truth. We can prove the existence of God. We can prove everything about Christ, about Moksha through your Self-realization. Because it is actualization. So now we have for about ten minutes the process of the reality. It does not solve anyone, it doesn't give any problems. All the problems will soon be and be solved. And you will feel satisfied that you have found what you have seen. All right. So first I will request you. There are two connections. One is that you have to forgive yourself. I forget the past. I forget the past. Because just now we have to be in the present. Whatever you have done or whatever has happened, whatever you have seen, please forgive yourself. As I told you yesterday only we have to be one beings. Only one beings can make mistakes.

Is it only the religious reason of the separation? Is it only the religious reason of the separation? Before a bata, it is a sword, it won't make difference. But a swan will just suck in the pain. When it comes to the bibek, the bibek is discrimination. When the discrimination comes to them, that's why it is called Hamsajya, it's called a discretial discrimination. Outside the swan. Bibek is discrimination. That's a very philosophical preach, is this, the way the Shudavani is. If one means the intellect, then he got so fed up. So he wrote Soundar El Ahari, where he said, let's pray, some other finish, that's nothing else. But every couplet that is there, he's a mantra. Take any minute, take Mohammed's house here. They are all with us. That's what Christ has said, that those who are not against us are against Him. But they didn't explain who are against us and who are not. You see, because the people came here, say Mohammed Sahib came here, or Christ came, that time what was the awareness of people? A suprar, very forward, but tribal people actually they had to deal with. And when Christ came also, he had to deal with horrible people there. So how far they could go? There was no awareness. Now there people are aware. You know, even now when I was living here, four years I was struggling with seven hippies to begin with. It has been very hard work. For sixteen years it was completely over. Namaskar. It's not like Turkey, like this lady, she got a realization just like Me. Four years I was struggling. I learnt every permutation and combination of problems, seven things. Now, Shri Mataji, that's something divine is happening there. That's used, I mean, that's not used. That's why I say the Muslims will take to Sahaja Yogi in no time, because they are dealing with the formless God. Mohammed Sahib didn't talk of himself at all. He didn't talk. He must have seen the point. He didn't talk. He just said that you follow the niraka, you talk. I'm just a servant of God, I'm a messenger of God. He didn't say he is an Adi guru. He's a primordial master, he never said. Because then the attention goes away. There's no idols in Muslim. No, no. That's why he cancelled it. Because people get fixed with it, you see. That's the worst case. And also for, he said that you should not have music, because, you see, during meditation if you have music, there's no end to it. You can have any dirty music, filthy music with that. He said, don't have anything. You see, for those days it was all right. But your Shri Yath comes not from Mohammed Sahib at all. It comes from Moses long time back. He, when he went and he found those ten commandments, he came down and saw people doing all kinds of things. So then he said, all right, then he, the third book of Bible, the angel you call it, Angel. The third book of Angel, you see, in my eyes. In that he has given all this Shri Yath that this should not be done, that should not, and you can kill someone to death. Yes, for the Jews. Yes, for the Jews. Not for the Muslims. Yes, it's coming from the... And the Jews don't follow. That time it was necessary, you see. What is the Sanskrit called is Samayaja, according to the time. Samayaja. So that was the time, according to the time. Like at the time of Bama Sahib, you see, so very men, very few men left and mostly older people. But the women were so many. So he wanted to establish the marriage institute. He said, all right, you marry four women. Even a young girl you can marry, you must have a sanction, collective sanction. That's why he didn't say that you have to marry four. And also you can serve many beautiful men and many women, and they are just pleased to grant them. Yes, of course. That's the reason. You see, to understand, what is this thing? So to understand them, we must first of all understand that we are human beings. No, it was done. Now, at the level of human beings you can't understand that. You can't understand that. At that time it was necessary. Of course, Samayaja, according to the time. Now today, you see, today as the situation is of Kundalini, so My attention is only on Kundalini. Because that's My job, now I will do that. So whatever is the Samayaja, at this time, I would say, of course, you can have international marriages, because now a world is going to come, it was born. So you can have international marriages, but you must have marriages. You must have monogamous marriages, you shouldn't have, because you see, AIDS and all that has come. So all that is in the culture of Samayaja. So it evolves, you see, according to the time. Time is very important. This is the time of resurrection. But people have really taken away all the truths with them, really them, and now this is My... For nothing, for nothing. They cannot understand now, since I am so angry with these English, the way they have supported this Salma, this Rushdie, because he is such a bad man, he has no business to talk like this about Mohammed Sahib. All right, I don't mind if he criticizes Muslims, it's all right, it is nice. But he is not criticizing. What, Mohammed Sahib? He is making joke of him. Stupid fellow like him. He looks like a... to be an idiot, that's all. No, he is hiding himself all the time. Why? Let him pay. He is paying you this way. He has made lots of money, that's all. Money making, all the intention. But today the time is different and the time is where the whole world has to be born. We have to know that we are part and parcel now. It's very different. Here we cannot have different races, different countries, different religions, it's out of question, out of touch. So we have to create something and that is so good, because that time how could they enlighten anybody's spirit? Nobody would have even understood anything. Nobody was so subtle, you see, they are fighting morning till evening. And so many of them took birth in this area. Like also you can see in Iran you had Shiraz, you see, you had these people, Zardoz. Five Zardoz took their birth in Iran. And then comes Mr. Khomeini. He did relax all. See, this is what it is, I mean, all their work is going, absolutely going. And in the name of religion, that's the best part of it. But that way I found Russia, the most Greek country, I gave them left and right, they were even of all. I just told them of, I said, this is what it is, and religion is this and this is no religion, this is nonsense, this, that. But only in Russia one can speak like that. I'll have some sugar if you like. Thank you. Shri Mataji, Shri Mataji, Shri Mataji, Shri Mataji, Shri Mataji. Shri Mataji, Shri Mataji, Shri Mataji, Shri Mataji. But now there are thirty-six nations. Shri Mataji, think of it. Shri Mataji, Shri Mataji, Shri Mataji. My husband was elected by having thirty-four nations. So he told them, he told Me that once you have about fifty-one nations, everybody else will follow you. Shri Mataji, Shri Mataji, Shri Mataji, Shri Mataji. It's too much, see, for people to understand Sahaja Yoga and to take to the miracles of pain, it's too much. It's too much for them. See, they become, they are too much grateful, so they are very human. There is no way. See, and the thing is that this knowledge is also, I mean, any other knowledge, so easy, sugar. This knowledge is so subtle and I am surprised how Sahaja Yogis have picked it up. In no time, in no time. But you begin to realize the miracles. Previously we are not realizing the miracles, even in small things. I love people. For example, tonight I have some worries for you, because some of you are alone, I will be here with you and my husband has dinner, a business dinner, and I was worrying about it. I just called my husband and he told me that this concept, it is a miracle for me. It goes on like that. It's always like that inside the... But some are so obvious, nobody can explain. Do you want sugar? Thank you. Come on, baby. Come on, baby. I think our village life is similarly the same in India. Of course. The tradition is the same. You see, we shall... that you are fully fond of feeding people, Indians are also very... So once what happened that these people came to Hulapur in Sangri, and the Indians had done all the work, they were Sangri and all the work, and that was them. They came. When I went there, I found all the interesting like this, very interesting and unhappy. I said, what happened? I said, Mother, they came and they said, we are very tired, they didn't take any food, must be something wrong with us. We were passing at night, perhaps maybe that. But now we can't sleep, you know, it's very bad, we couldn't feed them, this, that. I said, who told you this? So I said, they said, Matias. I said, call Matias. He was half asleep, he walked away. I said, Matias, what do you mean by not eating any food? He said, Mother, we are very tired. I said, you better make them up and all of them you have, otherwise these people are not going to sleep well. I said, but why? I said, that's single. That's true. You understand that? You see, if they are angry, supposing the husband is angry, he won't eat his food. The same thing in Turkey. Same thing. And they woke them up, all of them. And how was they didn't know what was up. This is cool idea, I said, please, you better go through it. Now. You have a picture now, can we do it even now? Yes. What time is it, 9.30? Yes, 9.45. Second show. 9.45 now? Now it's 10 o'clock. It's 10 o'clock. 9.57. There's two. I don't know what's the work, night time is 9 o'clock. It's 10 o'clock. I better take out this Diwali business. Tonight, too much. It was up to here. Yes. They were cool. Still I love all that is, she changed the. Would you like to have one like that, Mother? I don't think I could eat and then I could. Okay, sir. One piece, young lady. What is it going on? I don't know. You see, I tell you, it would be nice if I could. You know, I'm very happy. You must make Me happy also, sometimes. We are so many, you have to make Me happy, all of us. Good idea. Tell Me, you can't argue with Sahaja Yogi, I'm clever about that. That even God, I think. 20 dollars. When? 20 dollars. No, Diwali dollar, I mean, no Diwali dollar. 20 million. 20 million. Ah, no, 20 million. 20 million. Who in Israel? What plain goes from Turkey to India? Turkish and Turkish. I'm twice away. Tuesday. Tuesday. Why is Tuesday? I don't know what is next, but there is twice in India. What is Friday? And how much it costs? How much? 20 dollars. I don't know if I will make it over, or let us see. Now, suppose they see you say we are in a big focus. I know. I can talk to them. More than fish cake. Yes, quite. Yes, quite. I would like some of you to come here. And you need one way for you to, only travelling. There are no ships going. It takes only one way, I think. I've seen from Aden to Bombay, one way. From Aden to Bombay. Aden, Aden. Aden, Aden. Youth, I don't know. What better is that fly to find out? It should not be more than 100 dollars. It is so close. Do you mind having some other companies? What about this Egyptian Airlines? I don't know how much they can find out. They thought maybe they were maybe they will feel very happy about it. Did you feel like an Egyptian, maybe? No, did you feel like an Egyptian, Laura, if I can? This is the one I want, Laura. Who can I say? I feel like a mother. Mother. Got it. Okay. My husband also must have it with me. It is possible. Yes. Yes. They just want to know if you are happy with their food. Yes, yes. You cannot have any food. So many colors. You call us? Two colors, they don't have. You have to have. Two colors, all right. Give him the fifty, take back the other. No, no, no. What are you doing? Give it back. Okay. Thank you.

All right. Just have a tea, okay? Can you reach here? What is the name of the newspaper? United. United. United. United. United. United. United. United. United. United. United. United. United. United. United. Good morning. Good morning. Cheio. Cheio. Cheio. Cheio. Cheio. Cheio. Cheio. Cheio. Cheio. Cheio. say united in English you say good morning it's one of the famous newspapers I think I'm going to stay here I'm here till the fourth for this time there was second time could you tell me about you a bit my job yes yourself what should I tell you about you about you about you about you about you about you about you about you I was born in India I knew from my childhood that I have to do this work of giving self-realization to people it's a we're born in a royal family service is a royal family and they have also a calendar but now it's a long time back they were there and my father also for the great soul he was a master of 14 languages and he translated Quran a sheriff into Hindi language on that example was my mother was the honors of mathematics you but my whole idea was to find out a way and method by which I could be a master of it normally they take one disciple work hard on that disciple and mostly it works then it's all right otherwise they say all right we can't just put it down that makes sense Shri Kenaaradha kriyosochi, insanin bad neen eh volmasi, people are all over it it's found on freedom so she was born knowing it since she was a child, knew from her own power. What has only been done until now, as you know, find waktu' people useless o people go through a number of roads in the end. mechanisms that can give away the teacher of unity in isn't a small folk older than a pecum you will see that way in the program in the program in the program So in our country this knowledge was known to us for thousands of years, but only I always say poetically that there were very few flowers on the tree of life, so they could not become fruits. But today I think it's a blossom time. And in 1970, 5th May, I discovered a method by which I could do that, a master like this. And I think it's a very important thing. So it's a happening actually, it's an actualization and a happening that takes place. You can see in so many people when there is obstruction, this power that is in the triangular bone is pulsating, you can see it in naked eyes. And you can also see the rising of this power in some people. But those who are quite normal, it just shoots off. It's a very important thing. But otherwise if there is any obstruction then you can see it, this power. Even the triangular bone called as sacrum. That means sacrum is a word comes from the Greeks, so the Greeks knew about it, that's why they called it sacred. In Turkish also we know it as sacrum. Here, every person's energy is loaded here and the purpose here is to move the energy. This energy that the cinematographer makes, can move people. And even in naked eyes, you can see this in some people. You are a movement there, you are an energy center there. How do you see it? You see in the people as I said, there is obstruction and it's rising. Then you can see it moving like a little movement of a wave, you see. But it is like you can say a seed if you plant it in the Mother Earth, it sprouts by itself. In the same way, this is the thing, it's like a premium, like the premium. You know, it's a German germ, you see. It just comes out by itself. How do you get it to move, to move? See, it's so spontaneous, spontaneous. It is big. It's built in you and it is built in me, all right? It's like the Mother Earth is built in with that power and the seed has got built in it. So when you put the seed in the Mother Earth, it sprouts in the same way. Maybe you just show the method. No, no, no, no method, you see. It's just, even if they put hands like this, you see, it works. Just putting hands like this, it works. It works, why big? She might have got it, just if you don't have it. You feel a cool breeze in the head. I feel a cool breeze coming from the top of my head. Your head. Now, but just now see, take out the pencil from her hand. It's just put it. She's keeping it there. She's got her eyes up like a needle. Are you feeling it? Are you feeling? Yes. Ah. Because I could see your eyes. See the people's eyes. But now, see. What happens in the eyes? Shining. Shining, sparkling Mother all the time. What's this? What's this? What's this? What's this? What's this? Shining like a candle. Shining, shimmering like a candle. Shining. Shining. Shining, shimmering, shimmering like a candle. Shining. Shining. Shining. Shining. Shining. Shining. You are doing it now. I blame you, because I can bring it out and bring out the energy that went there in the center and then back to the center. Shining. Shining. It actually doesn't happen, but sometimes it happens. Can't you? All these hands are in contact with all the chakras. Chakras are energy centers. Fingers? Fingers. All the chakras in us have a place in our hands. When you feel heat or cold in any hand, you can identify yourself what is in your chakra. When you identify yourself, you can treat others. When you feel heat or cold in your hands? Not only in your hands. You have to feel cold in your hands. If you feel heat, it means something is wrong. What happens when you feel cold? Is there something in your body? When you feel cold, you are perfect. You have no health problems. Your chakras are clean. Medically can be explained also. Yes. There is explanation from medical point of view. You don't have to do much. I will explain only. Because it is important what Shri Mataji said. She is surprised. That is Turkish. That is Turkish character. Mother is very happy. You just get it like that? I was afraid. No, nothing to be afraid. The first time. You just like that. That means you are great. You are chakras. I am happy. Yes, you are good. You are good. Very good. And not only but you get the power now. You can give up evil. You can raise their Kundalini. This is called as Kundalini, this power. You can give them realization. You can feel it yourself. And you can know what's wrong with them because the Spirit is the collective being within you. It's the collective being. So you become collectively conscious. Human awareness gets a new dimension. Is it in Turkish language? This is Turkish. Yes, yes, yes. I am not sure. I don't understand Turkish. You can understand Turkish language. Yes, yes. You are a Christian. Yes. Is it in Turkish language? Yes. It is Turkish language. Yes. Are you Turkish? Yes. You are Turkish. Okay. I am Turkish. I am Turkish. I am Turkish. Yes. It's a different language. Yes. Yes. It's a different language. Yes. Let me ask you something. Yes. Finish with that and then join yourself to your socal . . She's just asking, eh, by this energy are you capable to move the things and make it? No, that's not important. That's not a very good thing. Also things are moved by the another method which you call as the great of the elements comes from the symmetry, from the plate. That's not a good thing. . Why do they call you Nirmala Dev? My name is Nirmala, Nirmala. Dev is called, Dev is called to any woman in India is called Nirmala Devi. That's the name. That's my name. It means pure. Yes, it means Nirmala means pure. You may accolade it, Nirmala means pure. Devi they put to anyone they can. It means to just give respect. . What is your aim in this Sahaja Yoga? . Just to give joy to everyone, their own joy. You see, you have got within yourself this joy in a dormant state, just to expose you to that. That's all. And you can't pay for it, there's no obligation, nothing. Like one can give which is enlightened, can enlighten another can. Then we realize that we are all one. Part and parcel of the whole. And such a transformation takes place that you become a peaceful person within. No agitation, no aggression. And with that, this transformation the whole humanity can change. . . . Now we are working in 36 nations. . And in Russia we are very successful, Russia. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . When you are united with your soul, you automatically reach that happiness. This is the purpose here. When you reach that happiness, you want to share this terrible thing. So that others also receive this pleasure you received. When you are united with your soul, it is with moving that thing, right? Of course. This is called movement. When you open your hand. Of course, it is not that simple. We also do it. With yoga. Yes.

Extremely dynamic and also very deep, extremely deep. So in our country you see all the saints react to the atmosphere of a country and to the all the bad things of the country and all cruel things. Now ancient time we had in India a system by which anybody who is a seeker of God was called as a Brahmin. So all of us are Brahmins now, absolutely confirmed Brahmins. Then another caste was there, according to the aptitude, like as you say, ya Devi sarubhu tehi shu jaati rupe na sahasita. So there you have to have the aptitude, jaati, whatever is your jaat means your aptitude and according to your aptitude and your attractions towards achieving what you wanted they had made caste system. But later on it became a cruel thing as it becomes in everything extremely cruel, I don't know what words to use, stupid and artificial. So they started the caste system according to birth which was absolutely wrong and they started treating some people as lower caste. So one of them is a caste called Mahar which is a very, very hard working, beautiful area of human beings. But they started calling them Mahar and putting them down. So because saints don't like all this nonsense and it is cruelty and this kind of separation of good people. So then he sings a song that, what can I tell you about God? How can I tell you how God supersedes people, how He puts people right or how He surpasses them. He Himself has taken birth as Mahar, as the caste which is the lowest. So this is how God has beaten everyone by becoming a caste that is downtrodden. So very beautifully put. Did you follow the thing? No, because you don't have that system here. But somebody is regarded as say, here of course you ill treat some people, say for example you ill treat people who are from black country, supposing. So now in that way in our country also we have a caste nonsensical system, absolutely horrible, superficial and nasty. So he reacts to it. He says that God Himself has taken birth now as of that downtrodden caste to beat all the stupid human beings. Now do you follow that? All right, thank you. So this is what he is. And that is how he has shown the superiority of those people who are unnecessarily caste downtrodden, which is a very harmful thing to any society, to cut out some part as useless for nothing at all because they are born in a certain family. Like here you have bureaucracy, or bureaucracy is not so much but you have autocracy, what do you call that? Aristocracy. I mean they could be the worst possible people, absolutely horrible, immoral, absolutely. But they are aristocracies so they think no end of themselves, which is so stupid. So he says that the God Himself has taken because he thought this is the purest form of human being, so took form as that caste which is downtrodden, the form of that, all right, incarnated as that. It's just only to karam can think like this. So beautiful. May God bless you.

Now I would like to tell you about the meaning and the reason of it. This is the power as I told you yesterday. This is the take-off mode and the guidance and this is your self-driving. Now yesterday I spoke about the tendency to only listen on that this is the meaning and the awakened of many foreign actions. What? Down there. What? How to take that? Yeah, I can't. But I'm going to use this time. Do I feel it now? When you're done there. Why not? Now? That is the purpose of you? Yes. This is following people as you know. They birthed it out and they are now the foundation of freedom. I can say in Europe and in India because they are the real people who have worked it out and have done such good things. So I would say that a person must have that state power and see it. Now inside the body you do not take any money. You do not involve into a money combination where people think you are great money so much of it is just both ways. Nothing, they are so compulsive. They are so full. But you have to understand what is good for you. And that's how you have to come take your realization and it's happening. It's very important. Now if I have gone to Ramayipal for the first time and I see yesterday people got their realization and you see how they are happening. Because they are people of sex heart. So you see they are setting down a way for me. This is the difference. Even I have spoken to so many people in the West and have explained to them you have very very large number of people from the West. Large number. But somehow or the other this is the problem. That is the beginning one of them is gone, then they will set it down. Then again she will come. But they want out and they have said sometimes they want out in Sahaja Yoga. But there is nothing to doubt. Because there is nothing to demand. Nothing to doubt. But somebody told me from the BBC that you do not ask for money. People think you should be. You must ask for money. They do not value Sahaja Yoga. Because you do not ask for money. How much money? Can you tell me how much did you pay for getting yourself a life? I will just say how much you had paid. So this is one has to understand that this is an actualization. Nothing has to happen in our life. Say that I said you don't want to go. So you better do one and be the counselor and be the counselor. But I don't know if people are thinking out of that. Only by Jigar you get to know God. You have not been inside the human being. You have been inside it. You have been outside the human being. You have not been inside it. I think this was you that you can find out what you are saying. You are born of God. You are very clear and clear. And people before church you just say, All right, pay so much money and I will speak to you. You like people like that. But that is the thing that I belong to when I am Asian and I am a Muslim. And I am not European. whatever power you have, it is useless for you. I have got the power to be natural unless and until you have the power and you suffer. In the same way you have to also find out what sort of the type of death. You see people who are in the man, the character man stays like God inside the recluse and see what. When you find some people who are just jumping on the street, jumping, age and the like, then you find another type who are proved out to be a saint. All these things you should find out. What is the power of this man who has gone through this? Has he achieved something? And then only for so far all the time, if there are any, I can talk to you about some people who are not here, in 9 o'clock, they can come and sleep. But today I would like to talk to you about the people who are on the street from the bar, and when you come there, I will talk to you. The main thing is sacramentalism, that's the people you need to come to. The love does not leave any land. Only you are a human being, and you should not come. That's the main point. Whether I talk to you for hours together or for two minutes, eight or three times, if you are human, you cannot rise, you are serious of my talking. Tuck, tuck, you could have been giving lecture, sacramentalism. What is the cause of this lecture? This is cannot make you a human being. The main thing is the sacramentalism. I hope today you will be a blessing of the Divine, and you will always get the sacramentalism. No one can do this. No one. No one. No one. No one. No one. No one. No one. No one. No one. No one. No one. No one. No one. No one. No one. No one. No one. No one. No one. No one. No one. No one. The follow-up program on two days on Monday the 2nd of April and on Monday the 3rd of April at 5.30 pm on both days at this ashram site where you will be told how to sit in meditation, what little simple exercises you have to go through to increase your experience and settle down further and further in your own spiritual journey. I am still going to a vile state to be not for you. That's why I see all your life as a spiritual. And as Srimadji says, to achieve all your right as a spiritual, you have pleased as birthright and by the grace of Srimadaji he has already granted to you the first six pages. Some of you who have not felt it, please do not feel in any way important. Because one time Srimadaji said, if you should be better, there is a silly cat and with an easy clearance, you can start feeling the divine vibration in your own head. So please do come on the 2nd and 3rd of April at 5.30 pm at this site for the follow-up program and to go further up in your spiritual journey. Please go home quietly. Do not discuss too much. We have used our brains a lot until now. Let the divinity work through us. Thank you very much.

So far, maybe there are. Okay, Shambhavi. Very. Then who comes? Can't believe. I see. I am always in the past, don't you? Can't believe. No time to scream yet. If this time is coming to a false country, somebody just walked in and rose today. It looks like paradise. Where the relatives of India that they have to live, that they were left to live. This is a little bit outside. Right, please. We have some finals. A lot of them. Probably a lot of them. They are staying now and then. There is a lot of people. I am not sure. I am not sure. I am not sure. I am not sure. Okay, I am going to bring some more. I am not sure. I am not sure. I am not sure. I am not sure. I think so, it's good. Oh, right. What's the point of such a peace? I mean, there should be more. You were changing. Yes, we want to move the feet out of the presence outside. We do not because we have no time. In fact, we did. We started in the beginning. So, no. Thank you. It's very difficult. It's quite. Very nice. Right. It's all right. I can't ask the audience and fix them. Very beautiful. Oh, my God. Very beautiful. Beautiful. Very nice. Very beautiful, yes. Very, very beautiful. Very beautiful. Very beautiful. I can't see. Some people, everyone should be there. Many of them can. Yes, like that. Of the height of the feet. These tools, they can find such tools. You're hearing, you're not going to do everything. I think you are. These tools are for the feet. They are for the feet. Along the floor. Sit down and watch. Yes, you can find a good problem. Yes, I do not know you know how to make feet. I know you know how to make feet. Okay. You have to do them yourself. You're putting people in problems. And now, what's the problem? You're putting people in problems. You have to go to the office. After all. But, you mean the other type of things? Yes, I feel so really good. Really? It's a very simple thing. So, it's like. I'm not sure. It's not that I have to come here. Do you need this whole data? It's both in the computer. So, it starts loading. It's a little too obvious. No, but we're not coming. Okay, you come at the center. There's a body on one side. So, beautiful. Good. A book? A book? What's in that? Book. Book. This one is for you. The hand, you like the hand so much. I think it's for you. It does not spoil. How do you do? For me, it's for her. For her? Yes. Okay. Then, what do you do? You just slide it right in and you just. This is no cover? There is a screen. There is a natural screen. But, it has no. This is a natural process. It is pre-logged. You don't need to already like this. Because the Bhagavat is also, many people come from that. Because it's only one hour, right? You can't, there are many Indians by the way. You see, you know, for Indians, it's not a cover. Like this. Yes, yes, yes. This is no cover. It can be formatted in any piece. For many Indians, yes. Yes. You just step up. You show yourself. All this has happened. All this has happened. All this has happened. All this has happened. All this has happened. All this has happened. All this has happened. Yes. It is easy, it's easy. Because you did not have anybody who could take it. But I mean, everybody. Yes, yes. However loud the person is, you have to hear what they say. Sit still, shit does not say that. I was not able to tell you everything. The last time also when I came to the city, nobody asked, but great or not. At this time, they were busy at the moment. The need for education is to come to all. There is a plan in everything in the back, to bring the time to break. We need to understand. We need to keep in our country, in our people, and we need to do it. And it's true. They make it difficult to do it. What about the sausages? Also, sausages also. You can just... We need to write them because it's not easy. They stay better. They stay better. They stay better. Everybody. The president will welcome. You take the floor. Oh, right. You say that's fine. Yes. Actually, I'm in the country that I'm going to be in. What do you like about it? I think that's the thing. I think that's the thing about India. That's why there's a lot of similarity in the community. In Germany, they were making a scene that more artificial. This uniform of clothing is a typical dress of Austria which the ladies were wearing about... when they... what did you say? A hundred years ago. I bought something for my daughter. A skirt and a blouse. I bought it for my granddaughter. Every country in Austria has different type of hair. I think yesterday they had different hats. They go for it and it's very nice. You really look good. Oh, yes. Think of it. For ordinary, straight dress. Your Honor. The thing is that you get in London. It's actually street-like food. In London, only people say street-like food. Thank you. The people who are in the street are the cheapest. But now, they are the cheapest. They are the cheapest. Now, who's the cheapest? Who's the cheapest now? I don't think they go to the country. That's the kind of thing. The crossword is very good. I got from there. The crossword was... I don't know what it was called. The crossword is a sort of thing. I mean... Ramen. Yes, yes. It's Alkal then. I think, really now. A good wife, really. At that safety, the German is easy. The German is young, is alright. The German has gone down. It's surprising, the German is young. You can't get anything. Really, really. Really difficult. It's only that everything is difficult. So I wanted to buy one with me. There's only one place you got one. The German seems they are not finished. The German is taking a picture. They say everything Japanese they want. In Germany, the labour is so expensive. So that's why they buy the Japanese. They cannot take to eat. The Japanese are so low price. That's why everybody wants Japanese. You call that Binance, you know? You can say yes. You can say yes. I can get one for one thousand dollars. It's just the same one. But that's why they have to close the time. Only the Mercedes is a thing. That's one. They will go for a gap to the car. The Mercedes has to be a car. GM does it. GM does it. GM does it. GM does it. GM does it. They are exposing us. We want to be free. We want to thank you. We want to keep you going on. We are all to keep you going. So it was a great comment. I'm very sorry. Just a second. I regard all the people who come to get this picture. They got the car. They do this actionable. This car was sometimes broken. It is stripped of another engine of a of a older car and the solar system. And it cannot do anything. People are trying to get the car all the time. All of them will do. But in the end, all of them will do. But you know who buys the most of the car? People. Any Indian will see. It is an ordinary shop. You know what I mean. That's the thing. And all in America, all Indians are buying the car. It's a kind of a thing with the head. Even the persons who are the coaches, they look after. You know as a waiter or whatever you say. He gets out from the thing and goes in the next. He must have a liquor. He must have a liquor. Can you drive it back? One for one, please. Here you have to be. I'm so sorry. You see, I have no small people and they still use stairs. This is the one. This is the cook, Charlie. How do you put salve there? It's a greeting. You find it? Let me have a taste to go. What kind of a thing? It's a Latin. Oh, good. So, probably there we made it. No. You made it? When we went to the place, mother, it was just a big hole. No pain in the top there. We made it. Wonderful. It's just a place of people. Really? It was Jay who I talked about to you this time. He's in here? Yes, everything is in here. So, he has not came yet? No, he has not come yet. He wants to see what has happened. Goodbye. Hello. Hello. We're using all this. I have a pyramid in the top of the house and the parents have the idea that she will meet and he told me that the parents will come to meet. Hello. And what is the place you have to be starting at? This is wood... What did you say? What? Slice. And this is what? Slice. And this is slice. This is slice. This is the part of the... The right name. Salsa. Yes. It comes from... The chimney at the opera he has made from this thing. This is what was there? I think it was there or not? This is... Actually, this thing is... It's a... This one here And this one here. This is pretty much the same thing from the Movingnya house. So I can find the source to use this thing now. Shall we go hang in there? Because there are people in here And these things that... It's going to have to... What's the other place I want to I think it appears in one. Very good. I'll look at it. For yours, you can add this to your bag. I'm never going back home. Do you like to play with something? I have this... I have that thing here. I'll look at it. I'm sorry, ma'am. I'll look at it.

Questioner 1 $illegal So you did it there, still more room. Papaji, rojai. It's good. I bow to all the seekers of truth. We have to know that truth is absolute. And we cannot change it. We cannot conceptualize it. So we have to only keep our minds open as scientists and see for ourselves what is the truth and what is the reality. We have to have our minds open as scientists and see for ourselves what is the reality and what is the reality. Today when we see in the world all kinds of problems, all kinds of opinion, ideas and also all kinds of theories, fighting each other, we can't understand. Today when we see what is the truth and all kinds of problems, all kinds of discussions, etc., we don't understand the motive. Everyone thinks they are right and that others are wrong. Because one is convinced that it is in the world and thinks that the other is telling us. But we should see what have they achieved by thinking like that. There is no peace, there is no joy. On the contrary, in all the very developed countries we find all kinds of horrible diseases settling in. Recently in London some people started becoming mad and they found out that the cows had become mad. So from all sides we are trapped now by ignorance. So first of all we must have the light of truth. The truth is that at human level we cannot perceive the truth. The whole civilization has grown like a tree. But if you have to really nourish the tree, we have to go to the roots. And the roots are within us. Only thing we have got to have knowledge about that. But if you are identified with ignorance, it is very difficult to convince you that you have to still find the truth. There is a higher state in us which we have to achieve, a subtler state. That means we have to become the Spirit. Christ has said that we are to be born again. But it is not a false certificate we should take that we are born again. Even in Sanskrit language we use this word born again, Dhrija. A bird is also called as Dhrija and a realized soul is also called as Dhrija. So when we are born we are still enclosed. We can say like an egg. And then when we mature enough the egg breaks and we have another bird as realized souls. But we must know it is happening within us. It is not just artificially accepting something as truth. We have for example these flowers we see. We don't know, we never even bother to know how they have come out of one single seed. They say we have come from Abhibara to this stage. But why, how? How did we come to this stage? What has worked out? What is that power which we do not know? It is the power of redemption within us. It is a redemption. It is the power of redemption. Which evolves us and we have now become human beings much better than animals. Now if you ask a dog to go through a very dirty passage he does not mind. But a human being cannot because he has developed a sense of smell and he can't bear dirt. He can't bear dirt but he can't eat a lot of pork. He is not interested in eating it. But he is very rich but he can't eat it. But a human being cannot eat pork because he is disturbed by the food. So that we have something lacking in us that whatever we think is good for us we just can't do it. That means we are not our master. Any habit can take over us. So one has to also feel this subtle power which has done all this living work for us. When you become the Spirit, the light of the Spirit starts shining through you. And then you can achieve a state where your personality becomes collectively conscious. That means you can feel your inside, your centers and you can feel the centers of others on your fingertips. So you become part and parcel of the whole and who is the other thing? Also you become empowered by which you can give realizations to others. You get all the knowledge about this mechanism that works out to an ascent. And you know all the technique by which you can work it out. So when this ascent takes place, when you become the Spirit, your physical, mental, emotional and spiritual problems are solved. Because there are these seven centers within us and when they go out of balance or when there is a lack of energy in them, we get into sickness, mental or physical. Now there is one power which is now preserved in the triangular bone which is called as sacrum. That means the Greeks knew that it was a sacred bone. This power is the reflection of the Holy Ghost within us. And the Holy Ghost is the primordial Mother. As we have got the Father, got the Son, we have to have got the Mother also. Just to show down women, they didn't want to say this perhaps. But this primordial Mother was accepted even in Greece where they called Her as Athena. Ata means primordial. So this power resides within us in every one of us and She is our individual Mother. She is waiting to rise just like a primule in the seat is waiting for sprouting. And then if somebody who is like the Mother Earth can give that nourishment, this power rises. It is placed above the last center. And it rises from there, passes through six centers, then pierces through the fontanel bone area, which was the soft bone in your childhood and actualizes your real baptism, really. And on this journey, She integrates all the centers, nourishes them and ultimately connects them to this all-pervading divine power. For this living work you cannot pay. You can pay for the hall, you can pay for the electricity, but you cannot pay for this living work. When the light of the truth comes into you, it's surprising you become extremely compassionate. You develop a state of thoughtless awareness. You are thinking about the future or about the past and dancing on the cusp of these thoughts. Now, in between these thoughts there is a space which is the present. So the past is finished, but the future doesn't exist. We have to be in the present. If I say, please take your attention inside, you cannot, because your attention is outside. So some happening has to take place to attract the attention of the mind. So some happening has to take place to attract your attention inside. And this happening is the awakening of this power called as Kundalini. And which happens spontaneously, Sahaj. Saha means with, chua means born. Born with you is the right to become one with the divine power, means the yoga, the union with the divine power. It is the right to become one with this power, to become one with the divine power, to become one with this yoga, because yoga is the right to become union. It should work out in an en masse audience. This is possible if you verify the level of the mind. But you have to keep your minds open as I told you, like scientist, and take it, whatever I am saying, as a hypothesis. And if it works out as honest people, you must accept, because it is for your benevolence. It is for your benevolence. It is for your benevolence. It is not only for your benevolence, but benevolence of your children, benevolence of your family, benevolence of your city, and benevolence of your country and the large world. This is what is going to happen now, that we have to enter into Kingdom of God. And the time has come for all of us to be there. After this program, now today I would like you to ask me some questions, and then afterwards I will give you Self-Realization if possible, and then tomorrow I will tell you all about the centers and how it causes diseases within us. After this, I will give you Self-Realization if possible, and then tomorrow I will tell you all about the centers and how it causes diseases within us. So if you have any questions, you may ask Me. I will give you Self-Realization if possible, and then tomorrow I will tell you all about the centers and how it causes diseases within us. I will give you Self-Realization if possible, and then tomorrow I will tell you all about the centers and how it causes diseases within us. Small questions you must ask. Such big questions. She says that Kundalini awakening can work out also in people, we can say very negative people. Or it's not dangerous, or maybe cannot also make a kind of ego out of it. The first one was a couple. If this Kundalini awakening can work out also even in very negative people. It's difficult to work out in the negative people. It's difficult because you cannot force it. As you have to become ultimately completely free and your freedom is absolute, you have to respect your freedom. Whatever you have. Now this is the problem. In your own glory and in your freedom you have to ask for it. What is the relationship between Sahaja Yoga and Christianity? Christianity, I don't know what Christ it is. Because if Christianity is not money oriented, but only Spirit oriented, then it's all right. If Christianity is not oriented, but only Spirit oriented, then it's all right. This is the problem. She said that in this case we may need a deep study about ourselves to find out what are our problems and we need a very deep purification. Yes, it is true the need is correct, but it all happens to you automatically. See you are sitting in the darkness and you can't see anything, then you cannot relate yourselves to others. Supposing you are holding on to a snake or a deer of a tiger, you think you need to go. And somebody tells you, you will say no, it's a rope, I can't give it up. Also you might be having a very spotted dirty clothes, but in darkness you can't see. But as soon as there is light you can yourself see how you are related to others. You can see whether it's a tail of a tiger or a snake. You can also see if there is any spot on your clothes. And supposing you have the power to cleanse yourself, you can cleanse yourself also. So it doesn't take much time, much labor. So many people at the first shot only become perfect. And also then you have to just know how to work it out, that's all. Hardly takes a month to master it. For example, in the dark if you have to walk through this place you may hit on people, you fall on some people, you curse someone, but if there is light you can just walk through. If you have to keep up with the light, the light comes to you and you can get right to it. name you in one lifetime. Then you have to go through the trial and error method till you become quite aware. It has happened to all of you because now you want to know the truth. So many of you are there, there were never so many in the history of spirituality. And also Christ has said that He is going to come back, that means He is going to reincarnate. Now how can you say that He did not begin to reincarnation? Also He has said, I'll send you the Holy Ghost, who will comfort you, who will counsel you and who will redeem you. That means He does believe that something is going to happen in the future. So this was His promise. If He had not believed in reincarnation, He would not have talked of the future. But we don't understand Him. We don't also understand Mohammed, sir. He also has written in the Koran in one of the suras called as Yasin, Yoga, Sastra, calls it. And He said, there will be a sent one, He calls the Holy Ghost as the sent one and you will get your resurrection. And your hands will speak. So how can you say that He said that He is the end of it, now nobody is going to come, when He Himself has said. They all say the same thing. We the followers, see they were like flowers, living flowers on the tree of life and we have flood the flowers and now when the flowers are dead we are saying this is mine, this is mine. It has nothing to do with reality. Especially Mohammed Sahab has preached, possess Abraham, Christ, Mother of Christ, her purity. And how can all these people fight? If they get all realization they will be all right. In India we have about two thousand people from forty countries and they are so happy with each other. They belong to all kinds of religion, all kinds of races, but no fights, nothing, great friendship. Yes, in friendship they pull legs. I joke with each other which I enjoy everything. It's such a beautiful life you have to be in. I am just asking what is the absolute, what the absolute is? What is the absolute? Absolute is that it cannot be challenged. You do not have a second opinion about it. Supposing there are ten children who are realizationists and you tie their eyes and ask them what's wrong with this gentleman. All of them will take, show you the same finger. One finger, meaning that they are feeling the heat on this finger. They all act like a computer. As if programmed by one person. And you ask that person, have you got trouble in your throat on the right side? You say yes, how do you know? You say that you spoke about Mohammed, like you spoke about Christ, but you say Christ is not violent. He was not violent, he was attacked all the time, so he had to protect himself. The only crucified Christ, not his disciples. But in the time of Mohammed Sahib, they tortured even his disciples and also his wives. If Christ's mother was challenged, he would have shown them his powers. Because he has very great powers of destruction. He got himself crucified because to prove that how stupid we are, how foolish we are, how blind we are. That's how we deny the truth. But his message is that of resurrection. That everybody can be resurrected. Because he died for our sins. So once he is awakened within us, all our sins, all our karmas are sucked in. When he has suffered for us, why should we suffer any more? Are we going to suffer more than he has suffered? So why this talk of sufferings by the Christians? But if you see, it is just a talk. Because I went to Argentina, Peru, all these places, and I was amazed Argentina, Chile, anywhere, there's not a single aboriginal left by the Christians. Even in India and China, they used to come with a gun in one hand and the Bible in another hand. Was that Christianity? Tomorrow I'll tell you where is Christ within us, how we awaken him. But very good question, because I could tell them all about it better, you see. We have to understand all these incarnations in the times that they were, the atmosphere they were, the people they were born. Yes. You are in a way preparing us in this great union, this great meeting with the All-Pervading Energy. So once this union takes place, then there is no need of religion, there is no need of religion. You see, the outside religion is not needed. Inside you become religious because you become a saint. You don't do anything wrong, you just can't do it. So you follow the pure universal religion. That's what Lenin was saying. You see, these are controversial subjects. But as you have asked me, I have to tell you the truth. I went to Los Angeles in the year 1973, and then I met some doctors who had cut their thread of the tongues and were wagging their tongues like dogs. They were Indians, I knew them before, and they wrote it down saying that we had to cut our tongues to do something called Khetri. So when the Kundalini is awakened, the whole mechanism starts working automatically, as when we start the car, all the mechanism starts working. And when she rises from centers to centers, first the center opens out to allow her to pass through, and then it arguments it constantly, so that to stop it automatically. This is called as Bandha, which is a living process. And then when it comes to this end, also when it wants to augment the Kundalini, to stop it from falling down, the center, it pulls your tongue a little bit, but you won't feel it, it pulls it inside, which is the Khetri. So no action is needed. Sahaja Yoga is a non-action, a kriya. But this is Yogananda, this is Kriya Yoga, that you cut your tongue, push it back, but the Kundalini is sitting down there. What's the use? It would be just like starting a car, without starting a car to move the wheels. The sad part of it, that those who have followed these methods are difficult to get realization, that's the sad part. At the very outset I have to say that yoga cannot be done artificially. It is a living process as we cannot create a flower artificially. As the seed has the built-in quality in itself to create the flowers, the Kundalini has the built-in quality to nourish your centers and to give a self-realization. I know that, I'm sorry. Because you are so vulnerable, you are so simple. They can't do that in India. Thank God Indians don't have money also. Milano people have lots of money. You are very vulnerable, very simple. I want to say that the Indian peoples who come to the Western world, who say that they are incarnations of God, there are such a lot of ways in Western Europe. How do you explain that? It's very simple. They ask for money, throw them out of Italy. But in the West the people are very money oriented and they want to pay for everything. If you say it is free, then that thing it is useless. How can you purchase truth? How much money did you give to Christ? You see, I would say you should ask the question in a nutshell and not to give lectures because they are very anxious to get realization. You should waste your time too much. Now what is the question? The question? The question is, if it's not something pretentious to want to achieve it. I could see that from your face that what you are saying is the truth. But actually you see, it has to work out. You have seen the point. And for that one needs wisdom. You see, that's what realization is. You see, if we can apply this to those who already got the realization and if it is not then it is not. You see, you have to become an instrument to discriminate good people and evil people after realization. It means those who have good vibration and those who have bad vibration. But what is the question? Well, I don't understand. You don't understand. Now what is the question? No one understands the question. You see, after realization I always tell Sahaja Yogis to be very gentle with those who haven't got it as yet. And to deal with them in a way that they get their realization. All right. Now what is this gentleman asking? I mean, do you want diamonds? You see, all right. If you want diamonds you can go to him but he won't give you. He only gives it to people who are very rich and who are greater groups. What is diamond for God? It is not equal to the dust of his feet. What is the other question? They want realization. That's the main thing. If you are hungry you will ask for realization. What a nice question. Now, we can say that if you have any more questions left, you see, you can write them down and tomorrow you give me before this side of the program. We will tomorrow have patience. All right. We will do it tomorrow now. Tomorrow, yes. Many are people getting impatient so if you please be kind. And tomorrow, again I will answer your questions but tomorrow you bring it in writing and I will answer them. Now, the most important thing is to get realization. I may answer all your questions because I'm quite good at it but that doesn't guarantee your realization at all. Now, if you want to have a five minutes break you can go out for a while and come back and then it will take hardly ten minutes for you to get realization. But when you are going out don't talk too much with each other, just come back. Don't discuss. Don't give strength to your brain. Just come with peace. It's better that you get a little bit relaxed and then come. Thank you. As I have told you before, Sahaja Yoga is a very important thing. Sahaja Yoga is meant for people who want their Self-realization. It cannot be forced. So those who want to have their Self-realization should only stay back. Otherwise you are welcome to go. It's the condition of the Western mind that they feel guilty all the time. After all you are human beings and you are not gods. So you will make mistakes, isn't it? So you have to forgive yourself fully. And it is a myth to believe that you are guilty. It's only your own idea. It's no reality. You see the Indians don't feel guilty at all. That's why there were so many bad horrible dudes came here. So now I want you to be placed very pleasantly towards yourself. Very pleasantly. I mean you must respect yourself. You must love yourself. This is not selfishness. This is understanding. I'm telling you all this because this is a very, very bad conditioning. So when you feel guilty all the time, this center there on the left hand side catches very badly this side. So you get pain in the left hand sometimes. Then you get spondylitis or you might get angina, a heart attack. So for you it is important at this time not to feel guilty at all. Let your Kundalini decide. She knows everything about you. So the first condition is really to co-operate with Me. Just say, I'm not guilty at all. Just say. You have to enter into the kingdom of God. Not into jail. So now please do not feel guilty at all. And the second one is a request that please forgive everyone. In jungle. Not in particular. So you have to just say, I forgive everyone. Don't think whom you have to forgive or what you have to say. And this is again another myth. The myth is this, that whether you forgive or don't forgive you don't do anything. But if you don't forgive then you play into the hands of people who want to torture you. And those who are torturing you are very happy while you are suffering for nothing at all out of your own foolishness I would say. So this is a very very important condition also. With this forgiveness you'll open out the most constricted center within you here which is between the optic chiasma. So now please please forgive everyone. Now. Tomorrow I'll tell you that there are two powers, one on the left and one on the right. The left power is to desire. And the right is to act. Now you put both your feet away from each other and take out your shoes because this Mother Earth helps us a lot. All right. It's all right. Don't trouble you. It's all right. I'll look after you. Don't you worry. It's all right. Don't trouble you. Now you have to put your left hand towards Me like this, suggesting of your desire to get your Self-realization. On the right hand you have to use for nourishing our centers on the left hand side. First I will show you how to do it and then you have to close your eyes. Now first of all don't feel guilty. Again you are feeling guilty. Now be sure that you all are going to get realization. All right. So be self-confident. Now put your hand on your lap comfortably. And you have to sit comfortably. Not bending too much or pushing yourself back but comfortably. You have to use the right hand now so put your right hand on your heart. Now this is the center of your Spirit where the Spirit resides. Now you have to take your hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. This is the center of your mastery. Now take down your hand in the lower portion of your abdomen. Lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. This is the center of pure knowledge that manifests on your central nervous system. Now again raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Then on your heart. Now raise your hand in the border of your neck and your shoulder. And now turn your head to your right. I told you already that this center is point when you feel guilty. Now put your hand across your forehead and put down your head. Now press it on both the sides nicely. Now this is the center is for forgiving others. Now take back this hand on the back side of your head and push back your head as far as possible. Now here you have to ask for forgiveness from the Divine power without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction. Put down your head and stretch your palm. I put the center of your palm on top of your fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood. Put down your head. Now push back your fingers as much as you can so there is a good pressure on the scalp. Now move your scalp. You will drop away several times. Move your scalp, not your hand pressure. Slowly. That's all you have to do. Now in this please remember that you have to stretch your hand properly and you have to put a proper pressure. Proper pressure there. Put down your head and push back your fingers. Very important. Now move your hand like this, no, but you have to push back nicely and fix it. Now we start with our feet apart from each other. You can take out your spectacles if you want. Put left hand towards Me and right hand on your heart. Close your eyes. Here you have to ask a very fundamental question to Me. You can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji. Now so please ask a question when you are dead and ask a question, Mother, am I Spirit? Now don't feel guilty. Please ask this question. Ask it in your heart. Now if you are the Spirit, you are your master. Now take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, press it hard with your fingers. Then hands side. Now ask another question. Mother, am I my own master? I have already told you that I respect your freedom and I cannot force pure knowledge on you. So you have to ask for it. Now please put your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen. And ask for pure knowledge by saying, Mother, please give me pure knowledge. You have to say it six times because there are six petals to this center. As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, your Kundalini starts moving upward. So now we have to marriage the higher centers with our self-respect and open them. Now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Press it hard. Here again with full self-confidence you have to say it ten times, Mother, I am my own master. Please say it ten times. I have already told you that the greatest truth about you that you are not this body, you are not this mind, you are not this emotion and you are not this conditionings. But you are the pure spirit. I have just told you that the most beautiful thing about you is that you don't have your body, your mental, your emotions and your conditionings. You are the spirit. So now raise your hand to your heart. I say twelve times with full confidence, Mother, I am the spirit. You have to know that the Divine power is the knowledge and ocean of knowledge. It is the ocean of love and ocean of blessings. It is the ocean of joy. But above all it is the ocean of goodness. So you have to say, I say this, again because you are all feeling guilty, you have to say it again and again, you are feeling very guilty, don't feel guilty. Now raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and your head is terrible. And turn your head to your right. And here you have to say sixteen times with full confidence, Mother, I am not guilty at all. You don't want to miss out in your Self-realization by feeling guilty. I have already told you that whether you forgive or don't forgive you don't do anything, it's immediate. But if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands. So you have to forgive everyone in general, not counting whom to forgive, whom not to forgive. So now raise your right hand on your forehead across and put down your head properly and press it on both the sides. At this point please put down your head and say it from your heart, not how many times, Mother, I forgive everyone. Now say it from your heart. Now please take back your right hand on the back side of your head and push it back, your head in such a way that it rests on your hand when you back. Here now you have to ask for forgiveness from the Divine Power for your own satisfaction, without feeling guilty, without counting your wisdom. So here you have to say it from your heart, O Divine Power, if I have got any mistakes, knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me. Quindi il petete questo, o potere divino, seo comesso deli adoli, coscente mente, o involuntaliamente, di prego di perdonami. Say it from your heart, not how many times. Now stretch your hand fully and stretch your palm and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood. Now please bend your head and stretch back your fingers so the pressure is alright. And now move your scalp with great strength slowly, seven times, but I cannot force self-realization on you. So you have to say seven times, Mother, please give me my self-realization, while moving your hand. Quindi il petete ochidete me lio percente volte, shreemata gi, desidero, rechervere la mia, relizizio en el se. Move slowly. Rotate lintamente. Now please take down your hand and open your eyes. Put both the hands so slowly. Now you please put forward your right hand and now put on your head and see for yourself if there is a goodness. Come out of your head. Bend your head, bend your head, then stretch. Now put your left hand towards Me and bend your head and now see yourself if there is a goodness. Sometimes you get a cool drink and sometimes a hot, doesn't matter, but after some time it becomes good. So don't doubt it. Now you raise your both the hands on top of your head like this, under like that, and stretch back your head. I hear you have to say a question you have to ask, Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? Mother, is this the All-Pervading Power of God's love? Mother, is this the Param Chaitanya? Anyone of these questions you can ask, three times. Now take down your hands please. All those who have felt the cool breeze or hot breeze out of their heads or in their hands like this, watch Me without thinking and see for yourself if you are feeling the cool breeze coming in your hand or if you have felt it coming out of your head. All those who have felt cool breeze out of their head or hot breeze or cool breeze on their hands, please raise your both the hands. The All of Milan. May God bless you all. I bow to you all saints. Tomorrow again I hope you'll all come and we'll fix it up better and also you'll call your friends, get a phone to them and this is the greatest thing that should happen to you. May God bless you all saints and may God give you the best of your life. Also tomorrow bring your questions and give them beforehand and tomorrow I will meet all of you one by one. Now, Iuckle you haveanny from honour and I know what you have done from being in the world of your lives. Thank you. Now be quiet and don't discuss it and enjoy it. May God bless you.

This is the Dhaba player. This is the Dhaba player. I bow to all the seekers of truth. I have been telling you that the truth is that you are the Spirit and there is an All-Pervading Power which looks after you, looks after every living being, does all living work. All the problems, human problems come from ignorance that they do not know that they have to become the Spirit. We try to seek joy in various things like material wants or money. Or we try to seek joy in pursuit of powers, worldly powers. Or we try to form our own attachments in different places like our children, our family, our house, our home. These are all our, but what is I? That's what we have to find out. And that I is the one which is lost because of our ignorance. Now as I have told you before also that you must listen to Me with an open heart and open mind. And if it is true, then you have to accept it as honesty. You have been already told about the centers we have within ourselves and the three channels which make the center. Fourth is the power of Kundalini. This Kundalini is your Mother, your individual Mother. And She has to rise through these six centers, nourishing them, integrating them and come out of your fontanel bone area. This is the only thing which is yoga, means union with the All-Pervading Power. After getting realization only, pray you are blessed because the connection is established. If you want to be healthy, wealthy and wise, then we have to see what we have missed in life. We always go to extremes and we cannot keep to the center. So like this if you see My hands are the centers and this is the left side and this is the right side. When you go to the left side, means you become very emotional and attached, very emotional, then the left side will be starting to be too much on one side. And when you become too futuristic and planning and active, then it starts moving on the right side. Thus we exhaust the energy of our centers. And we feel exhausted and get diseases, physical, mental and emotional. I have seen very common diseases in Moscow. One of them is what we call as diabetes. Another is liver. Third is high blood pressure and blood cancer. All these are caused by the imbalance of one center within us. That is the second center that we have here, the yellow colored one. The main work of this center is to give energy to the brain which thinks too much, to replace the gray cells. So those who think too much all the time, worry too much about future, plan too much about future or physically but very hard moves this center more. By worrying, no problems are solved. For future, whatever you plan, doesn't exist future, it's just your own imagination and thinking. It is the main stage of your energy. Now this same center has to do something very important. It has to be captured, you are liver, you are pancreas, you are spleen, you are kidneys and you are part of your intestines. So all these functions of these organs are neglected. The liver which has to eliminate the heat cannot eliminate it into the bloodstream. And this heat then passes upward and causes a little bit collapse of the lungs with that heat and you get asthma. It passes down and again it harms the kidneys and you develop kidney drug. Also in the lower part of your large intestine it affects and you get constipated. Also now there's another very important organ we have as part pancreas which has to absorb the sugar from our digestive system or transforming. That is also neglected. So there is blood, there is sugar in our urine and we get diabetes. Then the most important function is performed by our spleen. When there is any emergency, the spleen has to produce red blood corpuscles to meet the emergency. But if a person is all the time healthy and creates emergencies all the time by worrying or by listening to some shocks, then this poor organ becomes also crazy. So you develop a horrible disease called as blood cancer. If somehow you can nourish this second center with energy, then these diseases are not caused and can be cured, can be cured and will not be caused. Now this Kundalini is your Mother. She loves you so much and She rises through these centers, nourishes them and ultimately connects all these centers to this All-Pervading power of love. And then this power of love starts flowing through you. If you are permanently connected with this power of love, all the time there is nourishment which is coming to your centers. And as you become the Spirit, because this is the seat of the Spirit and when the Kundalini touches that, you become the Spirit. That means you become yourself and this Self of yours, when it is enlightened by the Kundalini, then your, when it enlightens the force of the Kundalini, then your attention gets enlightened. So you feel the joy of your being, of your personality. Because Spirit is the collective within you. And that is how you develop a new dimension, new awareness of collective. You start feeling your own centers, also the centers of other people. When the Kundalini passes through the fourth center, the sense of security will establish within you. The fourth center has the energy of the Mother of the Universe. who pretends this, looks after you and She creates antibodies who go and fight with you with this. When you get connected with that All-Pervading power, this energy completely establishes your security. Those women who feel insecure with their husbands or in their families, develop a disease called cancer of the breast. But as soon as the security is established within you, you feel absolutely relaxed and peaceful. Now the fifth center, sixth center is also very important where the conditioning on one side and ego on another side cross each other. So when the Kundalini passes through this, you get the energy of knowledge and light. And your ego drops out because your ego is suffering. Now on the another side is your conditioning. Now on the another side is your conditioning. That also is absolutely subtle and then this limbic area opens out and through it comes out the Kundalini. Now this is such a simple thing which is being waiting within us, this your own Mother. As you are at a human awareness, the time has come for all of you to become spirits so that you come at a spiritual awareness. This is the only thing you should ask for. You will meet all kinds of halls people telling lots of stories, talk big, play so much. Only thing you must see is your Self-realization. For which you cannot fail. It's a living process of evolution that you are from Amoeba, you are from the human stage and you have to go to a higher state. And please believe Me that all of you can get it. Once you get it, you can give it to your children and you can help them to get all right. Everything can be explained scientifically also. For example, these lights which are here can be explained scientifically. But there is no need to explain everything about the light, from where it has come the energy, everything, it's healing. You have to just switch on and all the lights are there because it is built-in. Like in a little scene, all the maps of all the trees it is going to be is written microscopically in the same way this Kundalini is built-in within you. So, I think now my tour of Russia will be ending today. And I'm sorry I have to leave you all. But you are all in the same place. You are all in the same place. You are all in the same place. But you are all in My heart. And actually I'm not leaving you. Whenever you think of Me, I'll be with you. But please establish this connection properly. And this is a very, very important thing that after getting realization you must know about this mechanism, about the centers and about how to give in to others. You must know about this mechanism, about the centers and about how to give in to others. Today you will achieve the state of silence within you, which we call as thoughtless awareness. You will achieve the state of awareness within you, in that state only spiritually you will grow, your life will grow. But you have to be collective. If you are not collective, then it will not grow. For example, if I cut My nail, then it won't grow because it is not connected with the body, with the collective. Now, such a big heart. Take it away from your heart. So you have to be connected in the body, the whole. Now you will be becoming part and parcel of the whole. If this hand is suffering, then another hand helps it automatically. You don't have to tell, you have to pay. So we have forty nations who are doing Sahaja Yoga. Now, these forty nations are your own, you are a part and parcel, they are your own brothers and sisters. They are your own brothers and sisters. So you are not alone. And who is the other? Because now you have become part and parcel of the whole. So that is a very blissful state that you know that you are in connection with the rest of the world. Any problem you have, you can write to Me and I'm sure through this All-Pervading power it will all be solved. Somehow My photograph has got those radiations of vibrations and they definitely help people in a very big way. Thanks to science that we have a microphone, we've got the photographs, we have got the aeroplane that it could spread in such a collective manner in forty countries. So it is our good fortune that we are born in these special times which I call as blossom time. So I have to request you all Russians not to worry about the future. Russians' future is going to be the highest than any other country's future. There are little inconveniences which you should bear. After all, for freedom, how much every country had to sacrifice. Even in your country, how much can you and these followers had to sacrifice to get this freedom? So please have faith in yourself. You are going to be the strongest nation and strongest people if you practice Sahaja Yoga religiously and ardently. Only in one year there is a change. I'll be coming next year again and I want to see you all grown up and paid sahaja yogis, all smiling and enjoying that. I see in the market, in the roads, people who are very serious and worrying about something imaginary. But you see the sahaja yogis among them, they are laughing, they are enjoying, they are happy. You can make them out, they are sahaja yogis. Somebody had asked Me about God and about Christ and all that is there. We have to know all these things after becoming the Spirit. Buddha said the same and Mahavira said the same. Because if you talk about God, before realization all kinds of man-made religions come out. So the first thing first is to get your Self-realization and your yoga, your union with the All-Pervading power as fully established. I wish you all the luck. After this we'll have a session of realization. So we'll show you first how to nourish your centers and then we'll close our eyes and we'll start the process of awakening of Kundalini. There will be a follow-up program after this and you all should go there and know everything about how to close the photograph and how to get all right and how to ascend still gently. So now we have the program of Kundalini awakening. I will request you first of all to take out your shoes if possible, take the hand of the Mother Earth, also the feet should be free. Now take out your shoes. It's just a very high state of this being. He's a very pure soul, very pure person. He gave His job in England and came here without His family, His time to work for Russians and trainings also. He is a very pure soul, very pure person. He loves His country and He loves you and I must say that such a luck you have, that you have such a great love for Him. Nice Sahaja Yogi here to help you. And overall, you are really very lucky, I must say the luckiest in the whole world, that you have an either like Gauravachan, that you have a very good love for Him. That you have an either like Gauravachan. He is, He's a saint and He's a born realizer, He's a very great soul that has come to your country. And the whole world appreciates Him very much. He has reduced the tension of the whole world, He is a world leader. And since He has started this class class, see people are amazed at His courage. So many horrible things were done about which you had no knowledge. So many horrible things were done about which you had no knowledge. And all the world was so suspicious of Russians. They didn't know that they were good people, they thought they were also the same type. But with this beautiful introspection and self-facing, we have all over the world, people respect Him. He doesn't talk make, He's not bombastic, He's not part of parties and movements as most of the politicians are. He's not a man of the world, He's a man of the world. He's a man of the world, He's a man of the world. He's so genuine, He's so great. Imagine He's a born realizer, that you see that's enough. So now, have faith in yourself, you are very lucky people. Extremely lucky people. All the world thinks that you must have done something great, you have such nice things. So you are the ones who are going to take this realization, because you are so lucky, I know. And you are the ones who are going to bring the heavens for the whole world. I'm not praising you, I'm just telling you the truth. So please follow Sahaja Yoga very well and help the whole world. I bless you all from my heart. Now please put your left hand on your left. And we have to use our right hand for nourishing you the different centers. Before that, there are two conditions which you have to follow. Is that permanent conditions for you in Sahaja Yoga? The first condition is to forgive yourself completely. Forget the past. The past doesn't exist now anymore. And this power of love is full of forgiveness. And there is nothing that it cannot dissolve. If you feel guilty, then this center catches here, on the, between the neck and the shoulder. And by that you develop a disease that we call as spondylitis. And by that you develop a disease that we call as spondylitis. Or there are many others like angina. So please do not feel guilty at all. You have to know that I love you very much and you have to also love yourself. And the greatest joy for Me is to see that you love each other. The second condition is that you have to forgive. Forgive everyone in general, without thinking about individuals. Whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything. It's a myth. But if you do not forgive, then you play into wrong kinds. And the center of Adya is completely closed like this, crossed. And the Kundalini cannot pass through it. So we have to open the center by forgiving. Another thing is that I respect your freedom. You cannot force Self-realization. So if you do not want to have it, you can leave the hall. All of you must do the ascent of the Kundalini. So, as it is, your left hand is on your left. And both of Me have to be apart from each other. Those who are sitting on the ground will not worry. You can sit like this, or anyway. Makes no difference. All right. Now we have to use our right hand. Please put your right hand on your heart. This is the center where the Spirit resides. Now you have to take down your hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side. You are working only on the left hand side. Here, now, just go to the position. All right. Now please understand that this is the center of your mastery. You shouldn't look this side and that side. Now the time is there to look at yourself. So now, please take down your hand in the lower portion of your abdomen. This is the center of pure knowledge. Now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Then on your heart. There is a corner of your neck and your head. You need not write all this because once you get your realization you don't have to do this kind. You won't have to repeat. Now, take your hand onto the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right. I've already told you that you have to know that you are not guilty at all. Please believe Me. Now, take your hand on top of your forehead across and press it on both the temples. Now, please put down your head. Now, this is the center to forgive everyone in general. Now, please take your hand on the back side of your head and push back your head as far back as possible upward. This is the center where you have to ask forgiveness from this power of love without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your own satisfaction. Now, stretch your palm and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area which was soft bone in your childhood. And now put down your head. Press it hard by pushing your fingers outward. Press it hard by pushing your fingers outward. Press it hard by pushing your fingers outward. Now, with great pressure move your scalp seven times clockwise with your pressure. Now, please put your both the hands, both the feet away from each other. Left hand on your left, right hand on your heart. And now, please close your eyes and don't open them till I tell you. You can remove the glasses if you like. You can remove the glasses if you like. You can remove the glasses if you like. You can remove the glasses if you like. Now, You have to ask Me a question, very fundamental question, three times. You can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji, whatever you like. Shri Mataji, Mother, I ask you three times, Mother, how long you have been here? So, please ask three times, Mother, am I the Spirit? Shri Mataji, Mother, I ask you three times, Mother, how long you have been here? If you are the Spirit, you are your master, you are your guide, you are your light. So now, please put your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side. And here you ask Me another question, Mother, am I the Spirit? Three times. Mother, am I the Spirit? Mother, am I my own master? Now, I have to tell you that I respect your freedom and I cannot force pure knowledge on you. So you have to ask for it. So please now take your hand in the lower portion of your abdomen and press with her. And here you have to say, Mother, please give me pure knowledge. Say it six times, because this center has got six petals. As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, the Kundalini power starts rising. So now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen. And to open this center you have to say with full confidence, ten times, Mother, I am my own master. This all-pervading power of love is the ocean of knowledge. It is the source of Absolute Truth. It is the ocean of compassion, benevolence and blessings. But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness. So you cannot do any mistake or any wrong thing which cannot be dissolved by this ocean of forgiveness. So now raise your right hand on your heart. Here you have to say the greatest fundamental truth. Mother, I am the Spirit. Say it twelve times. You are the Spirit. You are not this body, you are not this mind, you are not these emotions. You are not this conditioning or ego. You are the pure Spirit. Now please take your right hand into the corner of your neck and your head. And here you say sixteen times with full confidence, Mother, I am not guilty at all. Turn your head to your right and say it with full confidence. I have already told you that whether you forgive or you don't forgive, you don't do anything. It is a myth. But if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands and torture yourself. So you have to forgive everyone in general. So now raise your right hand on your forehead across and press it on both the temples and bend down your head. Here you have to say, Mother, I forgive everyone. Say it from your heart, not how many times. Please take back your right hand on the back side of your head and here without feeling guilty, without counting mistakes, just for your own satisfaction. You have to say, push back your head backwards nicely and you have to say, Mother, I forgive everyone. I have to say, Mother, I forgive everyone. Here you have to say, O power of love, if I have done any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me. Now, please stretch your right hand and put your right hand on your head. Bend your head as much as possible. Press it hard and move your right hand. Before that I must tell you that I cannot force Self-realization on you because I respect your freedom. So, please press it down and move your scalp seven times, saying seven times, Mother, please give me Self-realization. Now, please stretch your right hand and move your scalp seven times. Now, please stretch your right hand and move your scalp seven times. Now, please take down your hands, open your eyes and put both the hands towards Me like this. Now, watch Me without thinking. Now, please put your right hand towards Me like this and bend your head and see for yourself if there's a cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. Now, please take down your right hand and move your scalp seven times, and put both the hands towards Me like this. Now, please take down your right hand and move your scalp seven times, and put both the hands towards Me like this. Now, please take down your right hand and move your scalp seven times, and put both the hands towards Me like this.

A man's WHY when we were a young boy. It has been a pleasure to be here. Thank you. Forod. And thank generated by reading so many books about human rights All the seekers of the truth. I have no idea what you are saying. I don't know anything outside. We have to know that truth is what it is. So, all I ask is, what is the truth? An absolute truth cannot be known by human evidence. What do you like to have heard about? It is the science of our truths. All the civilization that is outside, needs better truth. But we have to find out the truth. Are you the civilization, our eyes and the head? This is Pika Dao, the abolition to the boyfriends in Pukunu. My roots are within the steps. But the boyfriends in any roots. When we are telling you about these roots, you must know that you have to become a subtle being to enter into that. And the inner because this is what's on the outside, you must understand that the inner is the reason that you must become a subtle being. And whatever is told to you has to be understood like a scientist with an open mind. And then, after listening to this hypothesis, you have to accept it as truth, if it is true, if you are honest. Unless selected from the Spirit, you cannot solve any one of the problems. This is not only an answer, but all the scriptures have said it, all the slaves have said it. But the same is true. The same is true for all the people. The scriptures have said it, all the slaves have said it. So we have seen also whatever mistakes we commit, whatever problems we have committed for ourselves, are only because we are not at a point where we know the Absolute Truth. If you know the Absolute Truth, then there will be no such thing as a Queen, everybody will know it. I perceive, even this fellow side, everybody will know it as the saint. When you see Absolute Truth, you will not be able to see it. So this is the Absolute Truth. This is the Absolute Truth. Why is it so difficult to see the same as the saint? Within us is placed in the triangular room called as Sechra. This part is called as Kundalini. In us is the highest, highest, highest, highest, the same as the saint, the same as the saint. This is called as the Sechra room. Sechra means second, that means keeps you about it. So we have to know two things about ourselves. That we have the Kundalini within us and we have also a Spirit within us in our heart. This one is called as Kundalini because it is made of three and a half coils and in Sanskrit language Kundalini is coils. The second thing we have to know is that there is a power which is all-pervading power of love which is true. So when the Kundalini is awakened it is like the premium of the seed that rises passes through your fontanel bone area and connects you to this all-pervading power of love. Like this instrument has to be connected to the mains. Otherwise it has no meaning. So unless and until you are connected to that power you do not know about your own importance, about your glory, about your nature. You can also see that you cannot see the whole of the Kundalini without the help of the mind, without the help of the mind. As a result of this assessment this Kundalini passes through certain centers which look after physical, mental and emotional beings. The Kundalini is a very simple center which looks after our emotional and physical and mental beings. Thus these centers are nourished, are integrated and we get the benevolence of our whole being. So where do these centers come from and how do they connect to our own feelings? On one side we have physical, mental, emotional benevolence and the other side we have the spiritual lessons. ... ... ... For example, in very last week there were three doctors who have got their MD in showing how they have cured asthma and physical disabilities also they have shown how they have been able to cure people suffering from black cancer. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... This is done by your own powers, by your own self. It is nothing that you can pay for it. It is within you, this power lines, which is just a measure. This is not the first time, then this is the inner, this is the inner, you can't do it like that. Just like one family which is enlightened, can enlighten many other families, in the same way it happens. So we have the opportunity to care, so please, I'm going to answer you to come and also pursue this. On the other side we have the spiritualism. On the other side we have the spiritualism. We have our own awareness. Firstly, we become collectively conscious. We become. It's not just saying we are brothers and sisters, it's just we become. We become, we become, we become blessed. So, becoming is like this that you can feel on your central nervous system, what is your heart. On your finger tips which are five, six and seven centers on the left hand side and five, six and seven centers on the right hand side, you can feel, you won't study what's wrong with you and what is wrong with you by yourself. But you can feel it also what's wrong with others. So you develop a new dimension of your awareness which is collective consciousness. and the other dimension of your awareness is collective consciousness. The first stage when the Kundalini crosses over this center, you establish a stage called as thoughtless awareness. In Sanskrit it is really Jhana Samadhi. The first stage is called as thoughtless awareness. Jhana Samadhi of Sanskrit. Why that? You can stop your course and whenever you want you can take it. You achieve your state of peace. You become a personality which aims to you. And when you achieve that state of peace, you become a personality which aims to you. No, thank you. Can you hear now? Can I see now? I'm sorry. Now, the second state of mind or state of your being becomes what we call as thoughtless awareness. very as far as the Kundalini is aware. At this state you can be realization to others and also you can cure people and you get all the knowledge because knowledge is all within ourselves. It is important to understand that people talk of peace but they know peace within themselves. They talk of love but they are so in love within themselves and that is how you become a dimension, a purpose. So, this is the state which you achieve, you become. This is the second state of mind, and this is the third state of mind. I'm here only for one day but on my tour but I hope to come next year for another year. On my tour, I have been here for another year but I hope to come next year for another year. But the rest of the knowledge you can have when you come for the follow-ups. But you have to be so strong that you can see to them how you become a common. It is shot down, I don't know how could you get the knowledge is like an ocean. After this I would like you to have your self-love. I would like also you to ask me some questions which I will never leave. I have not come here to ask for money, anything. You can't give me anything. I have come here to give you what you have. To give you what you have. To introduce you to yourself, to your own powers. The power of love. You'll be amazed that so far we have only used the power of heterodolgies. But this all-pervading power of love is so dynamic and so beautiful and so effective and efficient that we are surprised the way it works. This is actually Ashwini Vesey Agarwala. Sahaja Yoga is working in forty percent. And when I told them that they should write about their miracles, it was a point so high, a point so high. I don't know now how to write about it. So I would now request you to ask Me questions because it is such a spontaneous happening, it's a living process and spontaneous happening. So make the use to get them. This is a Shri Mataji protest and the Dendida protest and here again I suggest the common. Shri Mataji, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Shri Mataji, I'm sorry. Shri Mataji, I'm sorry. Shri Mataji, how to miss Shri Mataji? That's it. That's what I'm talking about. Shri Mataji, I'm grouped by you. Shri Mataji, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Shri Mataji, I'm sorry. Shri Mataji, I'm sorry. Shri Mataji, I'm sorry. Shri Mataji, I'm sorry. Now you can wait. She's going to ask you to come here. How was your feeling about East Berlin in the moment? Oh, great. Great thing I have happened, I must say. I went to Russia for a yoga seminar and the thing is that I met some people from India. They were the first to get the realization. They said, Mother, please come with us because we want this only, we want this peace. And here they said, Mother, please come with us because we want this only, we want this peace. So please come with us. It is your heaven. It's people's eyes. It comes to every, every. It's the feeling of Asia. And just after that what you wanted about after ages. This is after CAN dessert. and it's very intense to be in Baruch, you know, they get out in a decent pillow has a problem with the living in the middle, you know, they get out as a little bit sad, you know, you know, Baruch and I see as for this actually a problem. Why, why do you not have, how did you decide on God when you got this in here? Yes or not? If you have said, should they have corrected, if they have a problem with the second book? Because this is the center of pure desire, this is the energy of pure desire. Then this is the center of the higher conscious, this is the center of the higher conscious. All other desires are not pure because they never do be satisfaction. How important is the meditation on your way, on Sahaja Yoga? Meditation, how important? How important is meditation? You don't have to do meditation, you are in meditation. These are the ways of equality and making money out of it. So come and join a high day, continue and get up to a peak? You do like this and you will be good, if you do like that then you will get it, or else if you, you are punished because you are a sinner, all this is nonsense, there's nothing like that. You can do that too, then you can do it in a selective way, or you can do it in a selective way, or you can do it in a more positive way, this is all nonsense, this is all nonsense. So, the basic problem is that you have to have first of all experience of the salt-conveying power which is like a cold breeze in your hand and a cold breeze coming out of your head. Unless and until you have this, whatever you do has no meaning. So, all I ask is, what is the meaning of this? You have to have a lot of power and a lot of knowledge. So, what is the meaning of this? These are the talks, talks, talks and talks. This is not related to your idea. What I don't mind is the talks, they are ruling many people, they have formed their passage. The problem is that the water is too hot but the water is too hot so the water is too hot. These are not many oriented people. That means, all the water is not connected to the water. Either they are money oriented or they are power oriented, they are not Spirit oriented. They are in their age and in their age, but they are not in their age, they are not in their age. How can you pay money for something that's giving life if you want to? So I see that you don't pay for the flowers and seeds. All living work is done by that All-Pervading power of God. All living work is done by that All-Pervading power of God. All living work is done by that All-Pervading power of God. All living work is done by that All-Pervading power of God. In the world of yoga, there is a difference between yoga and the individual yoga. There is a difference between yoga and the individual yoga. There is a difference between yoga and the individual yoga. The individual yoga is the validation and the principle of the yoga. The principle of yoga is the elimination, is the basic principle which one has to achieve. The principle of yoga is the validation and the principle of the yoga. Someone means with the one, the two. If the guy, if you have to be united, you can survive. Sahaja, this is one, this is the most important. Yoga is the foundation of the body. I'll say Hatha yoga. Hatha yoga is the left and right kinds. Both are yoga. Hatha yoga acts in all the kinds in Patanjali, this is how it is described. Hatha yoga is practiced in eight whole states. Hatha yoga is the right and left kinds. This is the most important. In the society Patanjali is a thousand years old. Hatha yoga is the right and left kinds. And Hatha yoga is a painful project. Out of that, this exercise is the name of Hatha yoga. This is the meaning of yoga. Patanjali has so many different These in Patanjali they try to tense and make chakras one by one and one has to take sometimes lives after lives, watching realization. and the other has to take some time to get out of it. And the other has to take some time to get out of it. But he has only at the end of it, has got the sahaja yoga saying that this is all part of Self-realization and all the stages that I've told you, he described clearly. But today, the what sahaja yoga we have before you, has been many pure Jeth yoga in that body. This is sahaja yoga, that's living in this portion, that's called as Jeth yoga potential. You see, because we have no time. Then come here, we'll try to see. So I wanted to find out the method by which we just place the Kundalini somehow apart. If a point of the Jodha is given, we never become the leading change to hide other people. Because it is like many hair put together and through the central money, which is called as Ramana, you can raise few of them up. Very easy. This is so, if we have an half a day and come on, Shri Mataji, you can see, Shri Mataji, you can come on out very easily. And then, when it gets connected very quickly, then the relaxation starts coming up and these chakras which are very constricted, start opening up to allow more cells to pass. And then, can you say, how quickly you see? Please say, Shri Mataji, Shakras, you see, a lot of difference in that some of the earth men put around, when we are there, and then we move towards the middle. In that little light, you see the problem, yourself. You see, when you are finally seeing something, I will never come to you again. But that which you are putting on, you are stated, there's no need to doubt this. If I tell you there's a mistake in your mind, you may not have the little know, stop, please, fight with me. The Amadam was seen in the jungle, in the city, in the city, in the city, not only in the city, but in the city, in the city, in the city, you see, you see, guys. So, in this light, you yourself become your own master, become your own guru. And you see yourself as strong. And you throw whatever is destructive. Like, overnight, many people have to go themselves, overnight. So, we see the light of the Alhajan and the other end, home of the environment. So, the second one we talk about is the Raja Yoga. I went to California in 1971 and I was surprised, I met some old doctor friends from India. They had cut the threads of the tongue, and they were writing down the talk. They put on string. So, I asked them, what's the problem? They wrote it down that they were doing Raja Yoga and they were asked to cut the tongue to do a thing called Khetchari, to push back the tongue. Now, when you get any lightness, it's like the ignition of your car. As if the machine starts working by itself, you don't have to do anything about it. So, when this machine starts, immediately what happens is that the chakras start expanding and also operating, closing to keep the Kundalini up there. What a measurement! Now, at that time when it reaches here also, same thing happens that when the Kundalini passes this center here, then the tongue is little bit pulled inside to stop it from falling down. So, Kundalini is chakras, then the tongue is slightly more open and the Kundalini is going to fall down. So, it happens automatically. But supposing, without starting the car, if you start the wheel, what will happen? The wheel will be big. but what is something else, about with power, and there are siddhydaya yoga and this yoga that provide all animating compositions it's all about constructing the education Shri Mataji, try to take custom and value, that's your own. About, I think, the eight years or ten years back, the eight years back, the head of the Siddha Yoga, the one who was in this flying yoga in Gotra, he was a dino. He is by his child and his dino, deputy dino, also came from a dino city andatoes. Up to about 8 years ago he came to a World Serieskar insupport of the Olympics. We did! He was the other focus. and the people who He himself initiated Himself were nothing but possessed and are now reprocessed. He became a banker and he had to go to the South. He was a man who much entertained, and his wife was his granddaughter. What do you mean? And where did they come from? They came from the land of the poor, and they came from the poor and the poor. They came from the poor and the poor. But they are still in the market. They are still in the market. Now they are in the market. You understand? Why do you need them for all these reasons? You can come to India and can anybody be treated by way. But you cannot use all these reasons in any other country. But India, because all its plants do not grow here, all these trees do not grow in any other country. But you cannot use all these reasons in any other country. So it's a market in the country. But only they are not market money. But also I think they are market-based, so something like that. Besides this is here, I am a senior with a cow. I was a cow from the Philippines, and I was a cow from Aarhus, India. I was a citizen in India. I am a citizen of India. I am a citizen of India. I am a citizen of India. I am a citizen of India. I don't know what they do with epilepsy and cancer. But also I would say, the seekers must ask for the truth. Why do you want to fly there? Because already we have traffic problems.

Nobody is trying to tell me he's sad. I'll never. Madam, on God's way man looks glorious. The light comes at subjects and sees objects, dishonised under the image of the innovator. Everyone still looks half spirits with one hand. Allo! Music!

I have to apologize for being late, but I have so many things to be done. Since morning, I have to give presents to all the leaders from International, saying all the accounts have to be made, this or that, articles, this, and till five o'clock I couldn't even take My lunch and then I had My bath and lunch and so I would request you that you should not wait for Me if I need not attend all the programs, because I have so many other things to be done. So six o'clock means six o'clock you all should have been here and six o'clock you should have started your programs, because again it gets very late in the night. And then in the morning time you have meditation, also you must fix timings, must have meditation, then you can have a brain trust about ten o'clock and in the evening you can have your six o'clock program again. So that there is some regularity here, because if you depend on My coming every time, it's not going to be arranged that way, because I have so many other things to be done. So from tomorrow please keep it that you do your meditation, the morning, your bath and all that. Ten o'clock you have your brain trust, discussions and things and then you can have six o'clock another session here, after that you can have your dinner and then the music program should finish as soon as possible.

So please, we have been keeping awake three nights now and the whole day I had two times to rest even, because I have so many other things to be done. So I would request you not to roam about after six o'clock, but please settle down here and do have your programs performed here and so that everybody gets a chance to sing or to do what they like. Plus there has to be some discussion of brain trust and things we have to talk about it. We have to organize in a way how we are going to go further with Sahaja Yoga or all suggestions and questions and all that. So I think tomorrow at ten o'clock you can all do that, finish your bathing and come here. It should not be like a holiday camp that people are just roaming about. It's not proper, must be more concerned about what is the program is. I hope from tomorrow, I had said yesterday at six o'clock we'll start the program, but I didn't say that I'll be here. So I'm working the whole day. I have no rest, no holiday, nothing. So I would request you also, you should think that this is the time you have come here to meditate and to progress in collective way, to find out what's the thing needed, what is to be done.

Now we have today also a very, very long program. First we have so many people who have prepared dramas, plays, this, that, dances, music, all that. And so if you had started at six o'clock, it would have been much better. And then I have to give presents to all the Indian Sahaja Yogis, to the Western Sahaja Yogis I have given. Or we can postpone that and we can have it in My house tomorrow morning. I mean, of the two things we can do. So from tomorrow I hope you'll make it convenient to come here at six o'clock in the evening. You shouldn't be surprised, I may be here before you. These children are going to perform a dance on the yoga wall. Are they ready?

From Bengal, now we go on to Haryana. It's quite a switchover because Bengal is soft, sweet, melodious. And Haryana is rough, rugged, and tough. May I ask Mr. Gupta? You can see how rough, rugged, and tough he is. And what he is going to say, only he will be able to interpret and translate. The language that he was speaking was even foreign to me, being an Indian. But the gusto in which he was speaking was enough. The gesticulations were enough to suggest what he was saying. So, it must have been understood by all of you.

Now, from Haryana we go to a similar situation in Europe. A very rough and tough and full of mafia. Sicily. This is Guido Sicily. Italy. So, in Italy there is a saying that the whole world is a small village. Meaning that in each and every country you will find the similarities. You will find the same roots and traditions. So, for instance, in Sicily the marriage, when a girl comes to the right age for marriage, it becomes a very big family affair. I suppose like in India a bit. And so, now this is a song which we are going to present to you. And it speaks about this girl, which in fact she is finding excuses not to get married. And the father and the mother are asking her, why you don't want to get married? And she says, well, because I don't have the right sari. And then there is the uncle, the mama, which is going to buy the sari for her. I say, all right, don't worry, Guido mama will buy the sari for you. In this case I will be uncle Nicola. And then she would say, I don't have the earrings and then I don't have the kajal, I don't have the kung kung, I don't have the mangal sutra and this thing. And at the end she would say, I don't have the husband. So the uncle will provide everything for her.

Now let me introduce the family first of all. This is Rosario, the father. And then we have Conchita, Vijaya Mangeshkar. And then we have another relative, she is the sister, which she is having a shop also. So she is the one in fact who will sell. And then we have auntie Mamata. Then we have uncle Julie, then we have uncle Akbar with the tamburello. Then we have the younger sister Manju, Mamata. And then of course we have the girl, the beautiful girl, which is going to marry. So this is Koselita. And she has reached just the right age for marriage. So the refrain would say, oh my daughter, why don't you marry? Why don't you want to come and dance? And she say, because I have not... first will be chapels. And then the uncle and the father say, all right, don't worry, your uncle will provide you the chapels. And so then the father, which is Rosario, will say, all right, now the mother is very pleased and very happy because she has chapels. And then next will ask, so now why don't you marry? She say, because I don't have any salary. And so on. So that will be bangles and then marcasutra kunkum, kajal, necklace, earrings, rings, perfume, and also a razor. Maybe you don't know, but our Sicilian ladies, very often they need a razor as well. Sometimes they have quite long moustache like Baba mama. I will refuse to go to Sicily. Sometimes they have beard also. All right. So now we start our song. This is another uncle which plays the violin. He just came from India, from Nagpur. He is Uncle Simon.

She needs a husband. So where am I getting a husband for her? Ha ha! We have the ideal one! Yogi Mahajan! Ah! Wow, wow, wow. Yogi G, why did you present your application if you don't want to get married? A Guy Progressive! Now, of course, the song will follow because after seeing the beautiful husband, the girl she wants to get married and she says, oh, mommy, I want to get married. Oh, mama, me voglio marita. All right, print the file, we will select another husband. Don't worry. Now, of course, she says the moon is in the sky and, oh, mother, I want to get married. So please select. Give me the right husband. Now the mother says, oh, daughter, if I give you this yogi mahajan, for sure, he will take you to the Ramshahab.

So in this case, we can try to give it to Goptaji. Come along. Now, if we give this girl to Shambhukta, he may take her to Ariana. She did not go. If it doesn't work out, we always have caviar. So that is working out. I want to go. Sit down. So as you know, Caviar is working only that big computer company. So if we give it to him, I don't know what will happen. OK, guess what? So he will make her head become like a computer.

Listen, I have a good idea. We always need a doctor in the family. So I have a very good doctor for you. Oh, very good doctor from Delhi, Dr. Talwar. He's over 21, but he's all right. I think a doctor will not suit you. But we have someone else, a very good person. He is a tax collector, so it can be always useful in the family. Mr. Venugopalan. He will laugh my daughter without any money. All right, all right, come here. Now. In Sicily, also, they have a very good speciality. They have the worst name for daughters, like adolorata. It means full of grief, full of pain. So I think we need a very big manager, industrial manager for you. Someone from Calcutta. She's cooking very good fish, that I can guarantee. Mr. Jalang.

Alright, don't worry, I give you another doctor. He's an elderly man, but very nice. He sings very well, very fond of music. Dr. Sangwe from Nasik. Where is Dr. Sangwe? He's not there. Alright, don't worry. In the meantime, we can get you someone very special, very smart. A diplomat. A Swiss diplomat. From UN. From New York.

I'm going to give you a great mahayogi, a nibbleungen, someone from Himalayas, German Himalayas. Mr. Philip Zeiss.

Last one, last chance. A very tough man, from Iran. Hamid. You who dancer for me. Don't worry, you will love him. He can teach you. I take this one.

The western branch of Nirmal Sangeet Sarita. Yes, this is the branch of Nirmal Sangeet Sarita. Manju, where are you from? I am from Tarif. To follow this, we will have a very interesting item of the western branch of Nirmal Sangeet Sarita. The Indian singing Sarita would be singing the same song, one stanza by the western branch and one stanza by the Indian branch and the Nirmal Sangeet Sarita of Nagpur branch will be sitting in the middle supporting both the sides. And it will be one song and I am sure it is going to be very tough for the Indians to put up a contest against the western branch.

Yesterday there was a young girl from Shillong. Is she here? Could she come and meet me on the dais? Mr. Ajith Rampal and Sucheta Salgaonkar to contact Yugi. Mrs. Virunagopalan. Two members of the Delhi Yawashakti, two members of the Pune Yawashakti and two members of the Bombay Yawashakti. This is an item after this song.

This first song they are singing is in Marathi, which is like this that we have to tell you. The third one is Kabira song, which is in Hindi language. This achievement of learning three songs, not only learning the tune but learning the meaning and experiencing the classical notes was done by Shrimataji in a span of the morning session, just maybe two or three hours while they were in Switzerland. And I must say to the credit of these Western Sahaja Yogis that they have received the instructions of Shrimataji so well and so fully that the result is before you. Jai Shrimataji!

Dasadvaya Vahini! Aah! Gangamahadhi! Jahnimokalasi Kirtikuliki! Jahnikasukha Emenalakti! Khatakkamal Kavirakhi Bettih!

That was in Ragh Vairavi and Meenaji will bear me out that I think it is one of the most difficult ragas and the way our western brothers and sisters were singing, it was really an enormous feat I must say. Very well done. I think it deserves a very loud applause.

I have been toying with this idea of having a very healthy competition, we call it Jugalbandhi in our Hindi language, between the two dominant branches of the Nirmal Sangeet Sarita. On my right is the western branch of the Nirmal Sangeet Sarita, consisting of Guido and Jose and his party. And on my left, Nishi Madarshi has not yet gone to Switzerland. Shri Mataji, we were thinking of singing Tuyapujani and then to be followed by Kithi Varanamu to Jesus. And the ghazar will be common. First, it will be the privilege of Guido and company to make a beginning. The song is Tuyapujani, Marathi 36. I may tell you already that everything is loaded in favour of the western Sahaja Yogis. I tried to grab one of the Bakri sisters to bring her to the Indian side, but Shri Mataji said, no, you belong to the western side. Anyway, I wish very best of luck to the Indian side and my very worst of luck to the western side. But in spite of that, I know they will do very well. Now the scheme is like this. Everybody will sing the main theme of the song, that part will be sung by both the sides. Then the first stanza would be sung by Guido and company. The second stanza will be sung by the Indian side. The third stanza will be sung by Guido and one altogether. Okay, now Guido will begin. Start. One, two, three, four. Okay. We'll ask possibly Meenaji or better still Saraswati Bhai, Rane who is here amongst us to judge whether the Indian Sahaja Yogis are doing well or the Western Sahaja Yogis are doing well.

In the name of the Swiss, we would like to offer some Swiss Kawali hats. Shrimadaji, in the name of the Swiss Sahaja Yogis, we would like to offer Swiss Kawali hats to the Nakpur musicians. Thank you. It's a good protection. So, should we sing the Kawali? Oh, then Nirmala, yes, of course. So, but the Gajar will be common. So, first now the Indians will begin. Nirmala kithi varanavigatu jigastuti. And then the Western Sahaja Yogis will follow. So, I am distributing the mics, one here and one to the Western Sahaja Yogis. Hello. Marathi 48. Let it be full blast. All right. Thank you. Yes.

Maan waala hai te za devaachi anoohte Nirmalaah Kithi varna vithu ji kastuti. Noor leecha swarath tu Rudha spandacha la it tu. Anandacha sa it tu Stha karacha bharati it tu. Karamachha aapne kshatu Karamachha moksha khatu. Manavatejye khatvatu Nirgunante khatvatu. Karatrutvate khatrutvatu Jeevanache aas it tu. Sangita tasuretu Premata mahapuretu. Durya sarti rathu rathu Anand archa sarkarathu. Manavala tethi sana Devachi panu kuthi. You must clap three times, then only you can get into that mood. Jai! One kawali now. This is a new kawali.

I'm just going to say I have to do something to the right side. I'm not testing you in the middle. So I'm going back. Good. So, Alle, this is? So, musicians have come? They came? Swiss came. Swiss musicians. No, no, no. Everybody is eating, right? What's the time Alle? Yogi? You are not a saint, are you? What's the time Alle? Shri Mataji, I don't know. May God bless you. What am I to speak now today? Tomorrow is the pudya. I don't know. I don't know. Do you want the list? Oh, okay. I think you better sing some carols and let us finish with it. You all have been nicely sleeping and I've been working so hard and they called Me that Mother you must come, they are waiting for you. So I came and here it is everybody is resting nicely. Today is Christmas Eve, you must sing. All right, let's have some music for a while. If you don't mind, we can have some music. May God bless you. There must be something in your body, Colin. Soul is Bubbed with C Dodgy Do you want to stay with your anticipated views of your future? . . O Canada! O Canada! O Canada! Sing choirs of angels, sing in exaltation, sing, all ye citizens of heaven above. Glory to God in the highest. O come, let us adore Him. O come, let us adore Him. O come, let us adore Him. Christ the Lord. O day, Lord, we greet Thee, On this happy morning, Jesus, to Thee be glory given. Word of the Father, Now in flesh of His. O come, let us adore Him. O come, let us adore Him. O come, let us adore Him. Christ the Lord. O come, let us adore Him. We three kings of Orient are, Letting gifts we traverse above, Field and fountain, moor and mountain, Throwing yonder star. O star of wonder, star of night, Star with royal beauty bright, Westward leading, still proceeding, Guide us to Thy perfect light. Bases, sing us something. Born a King on Bethlehem plain, Gold I bring to crown Him again. King forever, ceasing never, Over us to reign. O star of wonder, star of night, Star with royal beauty bright, Westward leading, still proceeding, Guide us to Thy perfect light. Tenors, burn His hands to offer high, Incent of the deity high, Where I'm praising, all men raising, Worship Him God most high. O star of wonder, star of night, Star with royal beauty bright, Westward leading, still proceeding, Guide us to Thy perfect light. Ladies and Troubles. There is my beautiful view, In the light of man's truth, Now I'm shining, believing I'm still first of all true. O star of wonder, star of night, Star with royal beauty bright, Westward leading, still proceeding, Guide us to Thy perfect light. All together. Glorious now, behold Him arise, King and God and sacrifice, Heaven's listening, Alleluia, Alleluia, the earth replies. O star of wonder, star of night, Star with royal beauty bright, Westward leading, still proceeding, Guide us to Thy perfect light. O star of wonder, star of night, Star with royal beauty bright, Westward leading, still proceeding, Guide us to Thy perfect light. O star of wonder, star of night, O star of wonder, star of night, Holy night, all is calm, all is bright, Round the virgin, motherland shine, Holy in the storm, tender and mild, Sleep in heavenly peace, sleep in heavenly peace, Silent night, holy night, Step aside, and the sight, Glory still from heaven far, Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia, Christ the Savior is born, Christ the Savior is born. Silent night, holy night, Son of God of pure light, Savior fills Thy holy bed, With the dawn of redeeming praise, Jesus, Lord at Thy birth, Jesus, Lord at Thy birth. Which way? Away in a manger? A new song about Shri Ganesha. Shri Mataji, there is a new song about Shri Ganesha. Yes, of course. Can I have one more? Which one you like to sing? Away in a manger, No clear floor of wine, The little Lord Jesus Laid down His sweet head, The stars in the bright stars Look down where He lies, The little Lord Jesus Asleep in the hay, The cattle are lowing, The baby awakes, The little Lord Jesus No crying He lays. I love Thee, Lord Jesus, Look down from the sky, And say by my side, Till morning is nigh. Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to say, Close by me forever, And love me, I pray. Bless all the victual, In Thy tender care, And bid us for Heaven, To live with Thee there. Very sweet one. All right, you can sing Ganesha song. A man and a woman. Christ's life was such a life of penance that they had to use very soft tunes and to express their feelings and too much rhythm was not used, you see, because that's the side of Christ's life they knew. They didn't know Him as Ganesha. Otherwise they would have sung with nice rhythm and would have danced. Who can lead the Shri Ganesha song, the Austrian song? Lev, come. Can we have some Austrians, please? Some Austrian who knows the song. I'm calling Lev. Some Austrian ladies. Some Austrian ladies. Can you come next to the mic now? Please. Can anybody Can anybody Can anybody Can anybody Can anybody who has the sheets bring them to the front? Thank you. Shri Ganesha ki Jai Shri Ganesha please stay Shri Ganesha in us forevermore Long ago in heaven Shri Mataji created Thee So innocent and true All the oaths of heaven bow to You Shri Ganesha ki Jai Shri Ganesha please stay Shri Ganesha in us forevermore So, But it's nothing fixed. You have every right to change it or to say no, or whichever you want But just to give an idea that luckily, luckily when we started consulting the list we put them according to their age and their heights and things, and surprisingly we worked it out very fast. So might be, might be there might be some of them may be absurd, and some of them are left out. But I'm sure by the end of this tour we'll have something nice. Now there have been certain demands about some type of girls or boys, and somehow they are not there. So I've kept them still waiting till we find something to their liking, and I hope so very soon such nice proposals will come. Now I think I'll ask our marriage pandit to announce the names of the people whom we have now decided. Maybe I think, how many there are? Sixty-five marriages arranged, and fifteen more to be remarried, and then there are engagements, and some are, as I said it, we are still waiting for some better results. So in this short time we had another big problem because the UK list appeared when everything was finalized, and we didn't know how to fit UK people, and I thought we may have to marry UKs to UK. But it has worked out now very well that we could manage something better. Now there are certain things that we should avoid to marry in the same country as far as possible. Unless and until people are just demanding, it's better to do that. It will solve one problem, I think, that some girls or boys who think they should get married will not quoting people in their own country and spoil the whole game. Because if you start quoting like this, as a result of all that quoting is that, that you just get fed up of each other and you don't want to marry. So the best thing is that let us leave it for the last minute till we have decided on a very temporary basis. And if you are not happy, or in any way if you think it was not suitable, or whatever way you think it proper, because you'll be together now for the rest of the tour, you must tell us before you are getting married. We have had very funny experiences. Like I married somebody to someone. Then the girl comes and tells Me that, Mother, I can't live with him as a wife because I think he's My brother. But this happened after three years of marriage. So if you are in fickle mind and if you are not deciding, then it's better to withdraw than to bring bad name to Sahaja Yoga and to Me and create problems. Second point is that registration of the marriage should only take place if you are all agreed and that you have a complete divorce or I would say you are free people. Otherwise there should be no registration and nobody should take a passport as a married deity when she is not yet registered or a gentleman should not take such a passport because it's going to create more problems and complications. It's a very simple thing to understand that we have to have registered marriages, otherwise we cannot go from one country to another country. So it is important that we have to register the marriages. After we have considered it fully, after considering that you are going to be all right with that person and then to see that you are a free person, you are entitled to be registered. So under the circumstances, if you are not registered, you cannot take your wife or you cannot take your husband to any country that you want to. So one must understand the legal side of it. The most important thing is for married couples, then once they are married they should not forget their leaders. They should go and tell them as to what they are doing, what is the help they need and how to contact. But mostly as soon as they get married, they become birds of migration or something like that. So it's difficult to locate them. And then the problems start because they don't know how to proceed and all kinds of problems so far we have been facing, because the married couple did not stick on with the group, with the leaders and inform them what they wanted to be done, what they needed the help or anything like that. So this is a very important point that as soon as you get married you must inform your leader about it and you must get the address of each other and leave it with the leader and also consult him till you are fully-fleshed married people. I hope you understand that. May God bless you. So now here is the great list. Everybody's name taken should get up. I think better come here because I won't be able to see you. May God bless you. May God bless you. Please come up to the stage. All right. Also we have considered your heights. All right. May God bless you. All right. Next one. May God bless you.

Name of Yeah, I thought of South African. Mother, do all the girls are not heard. Ah.. Kami lo... with Karinna. Good Covid! Guy Jeffrey with Lenny Majgard Danish Australian. questionmed after that. Get ready. . Whatever was possible we've done, but maybe by day after tomorrow we'll be able to fix others also, because we'll see the people who come here and ask their also opinion about things. And perhaps we might be able to get for all of you something nice. May God bless you! May God bless you! So tomorrow morning there is going to be puja at about twelve o'clock I should say, because people are coming from all over and also some of the decisions we have not taken so far, because we have to ask them. I hope we'll make it convenient for the twelve o'clock puja. Also I must tell you that saris have gone up very much in prices and those girls who are getting married, they could have saris according to their own taste, but no sari or a wedding is available for thirty pounds nowadays in India. So I hope you realize that I have done shopping in Delhi, brought all the saris here just to make it better priced. But in Pune they are much more expensive and the saris will be for sale tomorrow and particular type of saris are good for marriages, which they'll tell you. Now we have a demand for saris, about forty-five saris, for about ninety pounds, which have turned out to be about hundred pounds. Those we have separately put. Plus we have saris for marriages and also some printed saris which are cheaper, but not also, I don't think, these pound mekone hai na, they are not thirty pounds, maybe slightly more. So we can't help it because the China government has stopped exporting silk to us and next year they said it would be even worse. So whatever it is, the prices are reasonable and I hope you'll be able to enjoy them. I haven't got any list of women who wanted to have printed saris. So, so far, we have only twenty-nine or thirty saris. But if you want to have silk printed saris, which we'll show you tomorrow, we can get them more up to Ganpati Puri, not before that, because I got them from a special shop. So, I don't know, they'll give, because they gave us some also discount. In any case, there's a tussard silk on that, there's nice print, you can see for yourself. Day after tomorrow we are having a program evening time, and also on the fourth day, I would say, would be, on Sunday, Tuesday, na, would be on Tuesday. We are having another public program. But you'll have time, day time, to go about for your shopping, whatever you want to buy. The charges for marriages are two thousand each, for every person who wants to get married. And the money should be collected and given to Mr. Yogi Mahajan. The sari money would be collected by a harsh maharaja. He'll collect the sari thing from you. Now in those saris, most of the saris, there might be a blousepiece, so you can leave the blousepiece behind, so they'll get it stitched for you, and also they'll get you a petticoat to match with it. That can be managed before Ganpati Puri. You must also leave your exact, I would say the exact measurement. Now the boys who want to have silk dhotes for their marriage should give their names to Me, so that we can get some nice silk dhotes. But as I said, they are rather expensive. Not very much, but they are. I have no idea of the price just now, so we can get those and the color you want of the dhotes. Anybody who wants to buy dhotes which are colored silk ones, please let Me know. Also there are boys who may be wanting to have a silk kurtas done, but I think if you go in the market you might be able to get yourself of your own size, would be better. Tomorrow we are going to get you a barber to help you. Plus I'll be sending the towels. I'm sorry I could not include that in the prize. They are thirty rupees each, about thirty rupees each, but very good towels, cotton towels. I hope somebody has collected money for the saris and for the pajamas and the kurtas. Who has done that? You have collected? Oh, that's all. Nobody should start any collections without asking Me. May God bless you! But they might be having, about seventy marriages will have ornaments. And those who want to have extra, those who are not marrying, want to have ornaments, have to give the money to Mr. Bhikkhu Ray and every set costs you eight hundred rupees, eight hundred rupees to Mr. Bhikkhu Ray. When you are purchasing from him in Ganpati Puraya, you'll have to give him eight hundred rupees. That's all. What else? All? Is there any other business? And I hope this New Year will bring forth many more Sahaja Yogis through you and that all of you will ascend once for all to that state of highest and highest. May God bless you! May God bless you! May God bless you! May God bless you! May God bless you! May God bless you! May God bless you! May God bless you! May God bless you!

I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the very outset, we have to know that truth is one thing. That truth is one thing. We cannot organize it, we cannot conceptualize it. And at the level of human awareness, we cannot throw it. Whatever I am going to tell you today, you should not believe lies, blindly. But please keep your mind open like a scientist. In case, since the hypothesis I put before you, and if it is true to you guys, in all honesty, I don't give answer. We have reached the stage of human awareness. But not yet we have reached the stage of absolute bliss. If all of us have felt the absolute truth, there will be no problem. But there are so many ideologies, and people have reminded the name of God as well. If there is one God, then why there should be so many differences? Why should people fight? Because we are sitting in the darkness of ignorance. We cannot relate to each other. So there is something to happen within ourselves, that we have to have some transformation. We have to place the mechanism which works out this transformation. The mechanism shown in this diagram, you can see it. In that diagram goes God as second. There is a flower which is God as Kundalini, inside the category. She is God as us as you, or I. And she is the reflection of the Holy Ghost within us. Holy Ghost is the primordial Mother power. Now this power is the power of pure desire-ness. As you know the law of economics is that the desires or the wants are not sexually in general. So what desires say for example to say another God? But then you have another desire. Once we get the God, we want to buy something else. So we jump from one desire, whether you know or not, we have a very strong desire within us, and that is that we should get united in this proper meaning power of love. The truth is very simple. The first thing is that you are not this body, you are not this mind. You are not your intelligence, not your emotions. You are not your ego or your conditionings. But you are your Spirit. And when you become the Spirit, then you know the second truth, that is there is an all-pervading power of love. This all-pervading power of love does all the living work. For example these flowers that we see come out of very small seeds. We do not even think how these flowers, such beautiful colours and fragrance have come out of a small seed. We take it from nothing. But all this work is done by that power which we describe as the all-pervading power of Divine Love. This is the power of the Holy Ghost. And when you feel that you are surprised, that moves in your eyes like full waves of breeze, so far you have never felt it, you have never known the existence of it. But it is very simple to awaken this and to become the Spirit, so that you can feel this power. As if this instrument is not connected to the mains of no meaning. Our life also as human beings have no meaning, unless and until we are connected to the mains. This Kundalini, the one who is in three and a half joint, rises to six centers above. And the last center which is below the Kundalini looks after our expectations, also our sense. It has nothing to do with our sense. Kundalini is above all that center. When she rises above these six centers, she vanishes them. These six centers look after our human mental development and spiritual being. That is why as a result of awakening of this Kundalini, you spontaneously get cured of your physical and mental problems. You don't have to take any medicines, you don't have to go to doctors. Then when she comes out of your constant bone area, you get the actualization of baptism, actualization. It's nothing artificial. And you cannot pay for it. How much will you pay to Mother Earth for giving us these beautiful flowers? God doesn't understand money. And you cannot purchase divinity. All those people who collect money in the name of God and live on that are really sinners. They have no business to do that. But we are the sinners and they will do the work of us. If you want Christ to come from Himself, how will you get the mercy? You will not take any money from Him? And how will you find out that He is the Christ? Because you are not here at that scene where you can think the truth. So now you have to think or desire to have yourself released. That is when you are spirit, comes into your attention. When your spirit comes into your attention, then your attention becomes enlightened. Then it is the source of all the knowledge. The absolute knowledge. Then you can find out on your fingertips what's wrong with you, on your sectors. You can also find out what's wrong with another person. If you know how to collect, then you can cure yourself and you can correct others also. This attention goes on purifying you automatically. Because there is life. Supposing you are holding a snake in your hand, and there is darkness. If I tell you there is a snake, you may say that this is just a rope. You won't throw it away till it bites you. But if there is life, then you will throw it away yourself. That is how you become your own guide, your own master. Also you have within yourself the center of peace. When the Kundalini rises above the center, goes into the rhythmic area, then you feel absolutely peaceful. Otherwise our attention is moving on the periphery of our being. But then we enter into the axis of our attention. Which is all peace. And we enjoy their peace. In the state of conscious awareness. Where we are getting awareness, but we do not think. If you want to think, you can think. But if you don't want to think, you need not think. Many people have foundations of peace. All kinds of credentials in the name of peace. Many people have got global prizes in peace. But within themselves there is no peace. I have seen some of them, they are very hot people. I don't know how they got this Nobel prize. So this peace is within ourselves which we are seeking continuously. The highest of all is that we start watching everything without reacting. That is how we achieve a state by which we know it. Or I should say we enjoy it. Say for example there is a very nice piece of cloth here done so well by some artists. If you look at it normally we start thinking what a nice piece, how much I must have paid, how much I have to pay. Or we get very shorted if it is ours in the area. If it is somebody else's then we start thinking how are we going to acquire it. But the poor artist who has made this piece of joy is completely lost in our conscious. But when we are watching it with our conscious, beyond conscious, then all the joy that artist has put into it just starts pouring on you from both the sides and starts absolutely soothing you now. Thought starts and then again another thought starts and ends up. Between these two thoughts there is a little space which is the present. But we live on the cusp of these thoughts, sometimes in the future, sometimes in the past. But when the Kundalini rises, She makes these thoughts to remain and there is a big gap and we remain in the present. Because past doesn't exist and future we do not know. Present is the reality. So all the dianism of the present starts working in us. And the person becomes extremely lively, extremely healthy and at the same time extremely compassionate. He transcends all the limitations of human thinking. He transcends beyond all the races, all the religions, all the ideas that human beings have given us. And becomes really religious. Because when you see this big part, this is the one which is stated as ten valences for us. These are the ten commandments we have stated in ourselves. So these commandments get awakened. And when we get awakened we really become righteous, really. What may be a Hindu, Christian, Muslim, anything, but can come in any scene? No one can be bounded by the so-called military, a fallen one. So we are not enlating this religion that is within us which is a real religion, is not a victim. Carbon has four valences while human beings have ten valences. And when they are awakened you become, actually you become, it's not question of just thinking or reading something, but actually inside yourself you become a righteous person. What we call you become a real saint. As we say in Sanskrit language, we jump. We strike a ball like a bird. Like a bird is an egg and then it becomes a bird. In the same way we also are first human beings and then we become enlightened souls. And what do we become with that? We become the electric-meek consciousness. So what? We can wait for ten minutes. Thank you. What do you say to others who have not got their self-realities? We are not so familiar with the idea of self-realization. We are not so familiar with the idea of self-realization. I am sorry some people have to leave but they become that name and they also get evidence. I think this is God's word. There cannot be anything. Okay, please give me a round of applause for the audience. Thank you. Next step. Thank you. Please sit down. Sit down. Now give those who do not come and get their plannings. Now give those who do not come and get their plannings. Can you hear the horn? Can you hear the horn? Because it cannot be forced. Because I respect your freedom. As you have to enter into total freedom where nothing can dominate you, no bad habits, no bad thoughts, nothing that you don't like, you cannot make. So for that total freedom I respect your freedom. And I am pleasantly your desireless at asking for your Self-realization. So it is about ten minutes procedure which we follow and I am sure you all will get your plannings. Now somebody will show you how we have to nourish our centers ourselves. Now they have two palms within us which I will not tell you about because I am short of time. What was the left side and the other one right side? The left side power is the power of desire which looks after, begins sympathetic to the system. And the right side power is the power of action which looks after our physical and mental activity. And the left side looks after the emotional side. So symbolically we put our left hand on your back towards Myself. You can keep it up on your back. Then we put our right hand on the heart. In the heart you side to the head. Then we put our right hand in the upper portion of our arm, the left hand side. And then we take down our right hand in the lower portion of our abdomen. This is the center of your knowledge. This is the center of your knowledge that manifests on your central nervous system by which you operate or you might lose. By which you become collectively conscious. Then you raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen like that. This is the center of your knowledge that you become your own guide. Then you raise your right hand on your heart. Then you have to put your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder. And you have to turn your head to your right. This center touches when you feel deeply. After all you are a human being and if you have committed mistakes, it is all right. Because this power, Divine power, has the capacity to dissolve all your mistakes. Because it is the ocean of forgiveness. You are not free in the end all. Now you have to put your right hand on top of your forehead and put down your head as far as possible. Here you have to say, that you forgive everyone. You forgive everyone in the end. Some people say it is difficult to forgive. But whether you forgive or don't forgive will go away. But if you don't forgive then you break into wrong hands. Now you take back your hand on the back side of your head. And raise your head as far as possible, back as possible. This is the center of real for your own satisfaction. Without the need for, without the need of your mistakes. You have to ask for forgiveness from this power of God. Now stretch your palm free. I put your center of your palm on top of your head, in the center. On the soft leg area, because it is soft in your childhood. Now put down your head. Push back your fingers fully. So there is a good pressure on your scalp. This is very important. Now move your scalp seven times, don't be clockwise. Now the strategy is to sit about eighteen cents or higher. That's all we are doing. Now at the very outset I have to say there are three conditions. The first condition is that you are not to be guilty. You have to forgive yourself for this. Now forget the past. The second condition is that you have to forgive everyone in general. Means you don't have to think about every individual. And the third condition is that you have to be self-confident. That you all can get some pleasure. You do not have any influence about yourself. Do not believe people who tell you, you are sinners. You are not. Christ has done everything for us. He has suffered for us. We have to just awaken Him, that's all. So please do not think that you are sinners, you have no mistakes, forget it. At this moment you are all going to enter into the kingdom of God. So you should be very present in this process. After all human beings are the epitome of evolution. And a little breakthrough is needed, little journey needs to be done. So do not get conditioned by what others have told you about it. Have full confidence. Now, just one request if you can make out your truth, this Mother Earth helps us a lot. Now you have to close your eyes. And you can take your ear, you must reply. If you have any desire for the neck or the eyes of God, you have to be very comfortable in the sense you should not bend to one or stretch to a certain length, but feel comfortable. Sir, you are very comfortable, you don't have to worry, I stand there all the time. But if I fall, at least many actions that you all should get to be relaxed. So now please put your left hand towards Me and just close your eyes. Please do not open the right hand. Please put your open feet apart from each other. You are sitting if you are sitting on the chair. But if you are sitting on the ground, it's all right. Now please close your eyes, put your left hand towards Me and right hand on your heart. Now if you want to call Me Mother or Shri Mataji, whichever way you want to be, now you have to say a very fundamental question. Ask the very fundamental question to Me in your heart. Please ask three times in your heart, Mother, am I the Spirit? Now if you are the Spirit, you are your master, you are your guide. Now please take your hand, the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side, and press it hard. So here you press it hard and ask Me a question in three times, Mother, am I your master? Please put the hand on your left, not towards Me in the way there. Now here you ask the question three times, Mother, am I your master? I've already told you that I respect your freedom and I cannot force your knowledge on you. Now take down your hand on the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. I'm here to ask Me a question. Mother, please pay an hour. Mother, please give me pure knowledge, say it six times. Because this center has got six petals. As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, the Kundalini starts rising. So we have to nourish our upper centers with our Self-realization. So now please raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Here you have to say with full confidence, ten times. Mother, I am my own master, say it ten times. I am your master. I've already told you that the greatest truth about you that you are the Spirit. And you have to become the Spirit. Otherwise you cannot enjoy life. By becoming Spirit you become the instrument of God. And this great divine power of God starts going to you. So raise your right hand on your heart and say with full confidence, Mother, I am the Spirit. This All-Pervading Power is the ocean of knowledge. It is the ocean of compassion and blessings. But above all it is the ocean of You. And you cannot copy any mistake, it cannot be fulfilled. It cannot be. It cannot be resolved by this. So now raise your right hand in the corner of your leg and your shoulder and put your head to your right. Now raise your right hand in the corner of your leg and put your head to your left. Here again you have to say with full confidence, sixteen times, Mother, I am not Indian God. Please say from your heart, I believe meaning you are not Indian. If you do not say properly, you will be more fast to this center. Now raise your hand onto your forehead and put down your head, please. Now raise your hand onto your forehead and put down your head, please. Here again I told you that if you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything. But if you don't forgive, you play in the wrong hands. If you do not forgive, everyone in your world is centered to the very constricted one. And you have to awaken Christ in this center. So now say it from your heart, even I forgive everyone in general. Not from Indian, but from your heart. Now take back your hand on the back side of your head and push back your head fully. At this center, without thinking, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction, you have to say all Divine power. If I have any mistakes, please forgive me. If you forgive, you have to say all Divine power. If you forgive, you have to say all Divine power. If you forgive, you have to say all Divine power. Say it from your heart, not from Indian, say it from your heart. Now the last center. You have to stretch your palm fully. And put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area, soft bone in your childhood. Now push back your fingers, that's important. I put down your head fully. Now rest it hard with the step. I now move it. Now you have to say all the time. Seven times slowly. But I cannot force on you Self-realization. I respect your freedom. So just while moving your hand, you have to say seven times, Mother, please give me Self-realization. Please move it clockwise. Put the pressure. Thank you for watching.

Can I just use your phone? Yeah. Just hold on. How are you? Good. Do you toy with it? No, I'm not a do toy. No, I'm not a do toy. It's just a taste one. Still, where are you going? Do you have his number? I do. She's on your job. I think Laura, she's truly born in India. How did it happen? I think that I would be a procedure or a thing of it as a discipline of which in character an individual is physically and mentally well. Each and I think you can do it with the same speed. It's the same without going into any discipline. So, you don't, as it were, sit in the lightest position and bring your body to the table? No, no, nothing of the kind, nothing of the kind. You can sit on your chairs and get your realization. What do you do then? I place it through the part of the area, which are the soft fields in your childhood and give me the extra-lateral of that field. Absolutely you feel, use your self-real. The eight beams of the very force coming out of your whole thing and you can also change the smooth field on your fingertips. It is the alternating power of divine love. Are you chapping what some would call them the God within us? Of course. Excuse me, fine meditation? No, it is just a continuous happening. It's a mental process of the living in it. I think my worry is that somebody is going to be like this. It just happens. One person is enlightened, one enlightens another person very easily. What changes do you see in the right words, in the lightness? First of all, when the mind is in the second centers, and we just... Praise Allah! ...in the center, basically you cannot behave as possible for our health. I think we are on to the next one. Maybe just that I was chapping someone else's heart, which I'm sure is real. I'm sure it is my princess. I think this is what we are going to do. I'm going to say this and watch what's next. This is the first one, four, three, two, one. Ah, yes. Remember twenty-six, I think, because he was twenty-five. He's still alive. Thank you. We'll sort that out. So you are twenty-six. I think we are. I didn't notice the number on it. I think he's now twenty-five. He needs to be a tail, a tail-rare. Yes, a tail-rare. Good morning, ma'am. Good, fine. Listen to... Does capital space twenty-six belong to the label? If it's too rare, we can make phones. I'm just trying to see if it's a onesie piece. It's a concert. Can you see this? Oh, well. I'll get to hearing now. Hello. I'm in your space. Oh, I wanted to advise you that you have a page to remove. If there is space down there, you could suggest that I do this. We only have one car space, one parking space. Would you mind going out and parking across the road, please, and if I can hear you in that place? I'm sorry, we just... If you're not down there, we'll just sit down there. Thank you. All right? No, it's just very, very difficult. I see a hot light. I think there's an area in the office. We have so many visitors coming in. And one space. It just doesn't work. Parking is just a play. You've got to have society. It certainly is. How will we... What time did you come in? I think we have... I don't know. It's a recording for this afternoon. Oh, that's all right. We were running a little behind our schedule already. Did you come from the shore? Not sure? No, just from... Oh, I don't know. Just from the hotel. Oh, you're welcome. Where are you from? A little bit. I don't know, but I thought it would be a little easier. I think we're just going to go there. All right. Can I get a picture? Yes. Oh, thank you. Oh, thank you. Ah, let's do it. Well, Lindy, we just had a little party. So, she said to go. Ah, I'm a bit out of spot on the road somewhere. Oh, well, I am a little late. I'm glad you said it that way. You're a recruiter. You're at least twenty-odd, is it? No, this actually turns out perfectly well. Oh, good. Yes. Thank you. We're good. We're doing well. Thank you. You see the car? This is a trick I found. You told me that before. I haven't had it. No. No. This is something that I've come to it. It is to me. I've been on the road for five years. I'm on the other side. You might have been. Where? This. I've been down that line for a day. What else do you want to do? How do you say? How are you? How are you? Very nice. I'm sorry. No, no. I thought that was okay. Good morning Radio New Zealand. Thank you. Goodbye. Hello. What are we doing here? Photographing one.

I bow to all the seekers of Truth. I have already told you yesterday that Truth is what Truth. I have already told you yesterday that Truth is what Truth. And we do not know it at a human awareness. And we see that with our people we do not know anything about Truth. You have to become a settler being. You have to become a settler being. You have to become a settler being. And so you have to become a Spirit. You have to become a Spirit. You have to become a Spirit. The fundamental Truth is that you are not this body, not this mind, not this ego, nor these conditionings, but you are pure Spirit. The is that you are this body, not this state, not this ego, nor these conditionings, you are pure Spirit. And that there is an all-pervading subtle power of Divine Love which does all living work. And that is all that is created by subtle craft-gift, the craft of the living Goddess, the all-believing God. Yesterday I told you how the Kundalini rises through six centers and pierces through our fontanel bone area, giving us the experience of actualization of baptism. The Kundalini rises through six centers and pierces through our fontanel bone area, giving us the experience of actualization of baptism. How She nourishes all the centers, enlightens them and ultimately connects you to this all-pervading power. We see these centers near, see the light and see the light in the eyes, with these all-pervading things. Today I want to tell you about the nature of Spirit. Right now I am speaking about the whole of the Spirit. The nature of Spirit, as I told you yesterday, that Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty. And the Kundalini is the reflection of the Holy Ghost, which is the Primordial Mother. As in the Bible they have not talked about the Mother much. But the people have created Madonna out of Christ's Mother. But the people have created the Mother. It is very important to know that the two classes are the same. If so, why did people go to this black Madonna to worship her? She is just a painting. So this Primordial Mother, which was in Greece called as Athena, Athena in India as Adi Shakti, is reflected on your Kundalini. We can say that Kundalini is the reflection. This Kundalini is reflected on your Kundalini. Even on the cross, even on the cross, Christ said, Behold the Mother, on the cross, on that precarious time. Even on the cross, even on the cross, Christ said, Behold the Mother, on the cross, on that precarious time. Jesus Christ has said something great, Behold my Mother. So this Kundalini is your individual Mother as I told you, and Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty. How is the Kundalini the reflection of the Holy Mother? And the Christ is the reflection, God the Almighty. So the seat of God Almighty is here on top of the fontanel bone area, but He is reflected in our heart as Spirit. So we are the six Goddesses of God Almighty, and the reflection of God Almighty is here on top of the fontanel bone area, but the reflection of God Almighty is here on top of our heart. Because there is one God Almighty, the reflection of that has to be the same. We all should have the same reflection, but the reflectors are different. Supposing there is sun in the sky, it will reflect best in a mirror, less in the water and not at all on the stones. So Spirit is the collective being within us. In the light of the Spirit, we understand that we are part and parcel of the whole. This collective being, which is the Spirit, is the one which when shines in our attention, when enlightens our attention, our attention becomes active. A person who is a realized soul can feel the vibrations of other people because he is a collective being. On his fingertips, he can feel his own centers and the centers of other people. On his fingers, he can feel his own centers and the centers of other people. Then this attention, which is through our eyes, is projected, is enlightened by Spirit, our eyes become innocent. When these are also mentioned, they are also produced by the light of the Spirit, by our eyes and our eyes become innocent. And when this light of the Spirit enters or enlightens our center heart, then we get complete security. It flows its light on our nerves and we become very powerful. For example, when Christ faced Mary Magnolini, He had nothing to do with the prostitute. But look at his courage, the way he faced the people and said, Those who have not committed any sin can throw stone at me. This courage we develop when we know the truth that we are the Spirit. Such a man is not afraid of anything. He says things openly without any fear. When you see something clearly, when you see there are flowers, you say these are flowers. Because you are no more blind to truth. So this attention, which is enlightened, can act, can create beautiful peace and joy in another personality. It gives you wisdom to understand what is good and what is bad for you. In that light you understand what is real and what is unreal. Realization is not possible for frivolous people. Or for people who do not care for themselves. And who are cowards. Because it's a very powerful force within you, which is the Spirit. Which is going to manifest its powers through you. You can give realization to others. You can cure people. You are not afraid of anything. And you are filled with compassion and love. We had a Sahaja Yogini from England who was staying in Dehradun. There I go. And she heard of a young architect who was down with blood cancer. And she telephoned to Me, Mother, should I go and cure him? I said, by all means, why not? And she cured him without getting any after-effects upon herself. And she told him that she was not able to get any after-effects. And this architect was certified to be dead after one month by the doctors. And the first had this architect who was not able to get any after-effects. Seven years have passed, he is still very well, he is doing well. And since even then he has been living and he is doing very good. So this Spirit becomes a curative power within you. It cures you and it cures others. With this attention you know the Absolute Truth. Now for once I was told that from India there was one gentleman who was released from the jail, came to Berlin and sat in the, one of the, one of the crossroads somewhere with orange clothes. And he became a very big guru. And then he became very rich. Now how can you make out if somebody is false or real? How will you recognize Christ if He appears before you? If you have ten children who are realized and if you tie a piece of cloth on their eyes and put someone before them and ask them what's wrong with them, with this gentleman, then they put up only one finger like this. So you ask the gentleman, have you got something wrong with your throat? He says, how do you know? Because this finger denotes this center. And all of them will say the same thing. So on vibrations you will know what is the truth and what is not the truth. For example if there are some mad people sitting and they start shaking before Me. Also there could be some egoist sitting who might also shake equally the same as the mad. But one would shake on the right hand and another would shake on the left hand. So you know that these are the egoists and they are the bad. Not only about human beings but about anything, whatever is the absolute truth you know. So there is no quarrel, there is no fight, there is no argument. On the contrary you enjoy each other's spiritual life. It's a very enjoyable life together in the collective. But the Spirit gives that light within us by which we develop the peaceful existence. And this peaceful existence comes to us with the feeling of peace within us, not by talking of peace but just the feeling within us. For example now there are beautiful flowers here. Normally if you look at it you will think from where it has come so beautiful and from where to buy and all those things, thoughts will start coming. Like this carpet is so beautiful when I look at it but anybody would be worried who owns it even worse than that. But I look at it, just look, I don't react. As a witness and the joy that the artist has put in this carpet starts pouring on my being like beautiful stream of peace. And our attention thus becomes extremely steady. Many people these days develop with something called tension. All the time they say there is a tension. It's a common disease. It comes either by too much conditioning or by ego. But supposing both these balloons are removed then there cannot be any tension at all. Because we think that we have done something this tension builds in us. But what do we do? Now say a tree was dead so out of the tree we made the stage and think that we have done something very great. From dead to dead. We have done no living work. This ego comes to us that we have done this, we have done that. We cannot even produce a small little molecule. Leave around the flowers. So now after realization you start doing living work. And give realization to human beings. And completely transform them. But the greatest achievement is that you jump into the ocean of joy. There is no jealousy, hatred, anything of that kind. You just become joyous. Joy is not duality. Not like this is happiness and unhappiness. Joy cannot be described but is to be experienced. There are so many things that happen to a Sahaja Yogi that in this short lecture I may not be able to tell you. This knowledge is limitless. Only in English language I must have given 4000 lectures. But it is like this that when you come in this room there are lights and you have to just switch on one switch. I don't have to tell you about the history of electricity, how it came to Berlin and how it was brought in this hall. It will be bored stiff. It is all built in. In the same way it is built in you also, the whole thing. Only thing is to enlighten you. Once the switch is on or when you are connected with the mains it starts working. So it is better to get your enlightenment first and then you can listen to all My tapes. By reading too much also we get confused. By reading anything you cannot achieve truth. But only by experience you can achieve the truth. You must please put down your hand. What's the matter with you? Only through experience you can know the truth. And you have to certify yourself. No one can certify you except for yourself and this is the last judgment. This is how the resurrection is working out everywhere. I am sorry I came to Berlin very late because we had no center in Berlin. But now I feel very confident that it will work out because I find you people extremely honest. I find you very sincere and very happy. Again today if you have to ask Me questions just ask for you because yesterday you wasted too much of time. I want to meet all of you and attend to you individually. I am very happy to meet you. Were you there yesterday? Yes, we were there. What is it? What do you want to ask? If you are aware then you are a free Mason brother. Of course, so what? Ja, und wer sisten bei. I know that also. Then what? See now why have you come here to quarrel with Me? What have I done wrong to you? This does not belong now to free Mason. This is all. All right? This does not belong anymore to free Mason. It is owned by some private company now. Do you understand that? Of course there is. What do you want to say? I don't understand. You have paid for it, you have not paid for it, you can go. Why do you want to disturb anyone? If you are free Mason I know what free Mason are doing. I don't want to talk about them. Why? Why do you want to talk about these things? Are you not interested in your spirit? Why do you want to waste everybody's time like that? You seem to be a sensible man. Then? All right, keep quiet. What is it now? What is it? What did you say? You come first time today, is it madam? Now listen to me. It is an experience. It is not understanding mental. All right? First you have the experience and then you will understand it better. I know it is quite subtle because we live in gross life. But when you see a world without the mental level, you must be aware of the mental level. But still you have not understood, doesn't matter. We will make you understand. Have patience with yourself. Have patience with yourself. What's it? Let it be. It's all right, I'll manage it, doesn't matter. He's all right, I'll manage it. All right. About those what? What do you say? You see, you read some book and come and tell Me. You see, that's not the way. Try to understand what I am saying. Now, not whatever you have read, you have achieved nothing out of it. So why do you want to come and tell Me something that you have read? You just try to have patience and get your realization. All right? Because supposing you think that you read some book, then you come and mention some word to Me. That's not the way. I am here to give you the key of your realization. All right? There's no examination. There's no examination going on with me, is it? If you have not understood, doesn't matter. You will understand. But you read some book X, Y, Z, then you go to some guru, you go there and then you come and ask Me questions. That's not the way. The way is to ask a relevant question. If you really want to have your realization, then ask a relevant question. All right? Now what are these seven chakras are? There are seven chakras, no doubt. And the Kundalini rises and pierces through this fontanel bone area, where is the seat of the God Almighty which is reflecting in our heart. All right? That's all. Now you see if it happens to you or not. Yesterday there were very nice questions, I must say. Because, you see, you have read so many books. I know you have. But did it give you the answer? Did it give you the experience? You are here to take the experience. Now I'll have to ask you to go. You are just, you don't know anything, you see, you are so ignorant. All right, now you go then. According to us you don't. Everybody wants you to go out, finished. Will you please go out? You see the door is open to anyone. Mad people can also come in, doesn't matter. But now it's all right. You better go now. Now, now will you please go? We don't want you here, finished. You better go. Useless. Useless, you have to go, I'm sorry. That's all. This is the way. Look at this. Just imagine what is the matter with the people, I mean. You see, must have some sense in the heads. What is he saying? Let them go. It's all right. You see, we are not here today. We are not here for 300 years. We are here for the people who want to be fulfilled. And we know what it is about us to become, what it is about us to become. And we know what it is about us to become. And it is about being special, it is about being special. And we know that our time is not in our own interest. We are interested in the people who are interested in our own respect for our own people. And we want to take this responsibility from them. We want to take it as a respect. You see, problem is like this. You see, there are many people who are in the market. You know, they are making money out of their preaching. There are many people. And because I say you cannot take money, they are all against me. They are feeling challenged. And that's why they send some people like this. But truth has to be the thing that will really challenge falsehood. What can you do? So, but it's nowadays, I would say, it's not so much. It used to be much more. Because there are so many false gurus in this world and so many false things going on. And when you talk of the truth, naturally they do not like it because they are earning money out of you. It's a big business. This is the reason why there is an opposition like this. But openly they will never oppose. They will send some madman like this to talk. That's all. But I must tell you that some countries, they are very sensitive. Like I must tell you about Russia. In Russia, anywhere I go, we have to book a stadium. 14 to 16 thousand people come. And very well educated and scientists of a level, very good seekers. And they achieve also great heights. I've never faced anything like this in any one of these countries. But you know that we have here people who are, this is the beginning of Sahaja Yoga, so naturally one has to face it, not to feel bad about it. So this is nothing new to me. Alright, doesn't matter. So now I think we should not allow you to ask questions because that means if this waste of time is better that you get your realization first. Then you will not ask me any questions. And yesterday also I told you that these are mental acrobats. What is the use of doing this mental acrobat? I'm quite good at answering but just waste of time. So now, we better stick to our realization first. But you must have an open mind of a scientist. That is, you should take it as a hypothesis to begin with. And if it is proved, then you have to accept it as honest people. Because it is not only for your emancipation but emancipation of the whole world. Now, there are three conditions as I told you. Nobody should feel guilty. Forget the past. Yesterday there was a lady who was saying that, Mother, I cannot get over my guilt. Don't you know it is just a mental projection? I also told that if you feel guilty, the center catches very badly here on the left side and you get angina, you get also what you call subspondylitis. So many diseases you get with this catch. See, they have closed all the windows, that's why. I don't know why. Can you ask someone to do this? All right. So that second condition is not to feel guilty at all. As you are human beings, you are not God. If you have done mistakes, so what does it matter? Because this divine power is the power of forgiveness. And whatever mistakes you may commit, it can dissolve all the mistakes. This gentleman has closed it. So does he. There was one gentleman who came and closed it. He was not God. All right. Now we have the third condition which may look difficult but is the easiest thing to do. The condition is that you have to forgive everyone. Even forgive this gentleman. Because whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything. But if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands. And you torture yourself unnecessarily. So it is important, very important that you have to forgive everyone without thinking about them individually, in general. As I told you yesterday, the one which is in the optic chakra is like this closed, absolutely closed chakra. Closed chakra. And if you don't forgive, it won't open. But if you forgive, it opens like this, eventually. And makes the Kundalini to pass through. These are the only three conditions. There are two sides, left and right. We have two sides, a right and a left. The left side energy is the power of desire. The energy of desire is the power of action. And the right side is the power of action. And the right side is the power of thought. Please put both the feet apart from each other. Stay with the parallel body, not with your hands, with a little bit of strength. So that the left side is away from the right side and take out your shoes. In the beginning it happens everywhere, doesn't it? And those who are sitting on the ground are all right, they don't have to worry. All right. Now please put the left hand on your lap. This is symbolic that you desire to have your Self-realization. This is symbolic that you desire to have your Self-realization. You have put your right hand now on your heart, because in the heart resides the Spirit. Sit with the comfortable, sir, just a second. It's to open, open out your, well, open out, not to lock it up. Sit with the comfortable, not to lock it up. Shleesen sie sich nicht. Now, if you are the Spirit, if you become, you become your own master. Im herzen Hundergeist und wenn sie der Geist sind, so werden sie auch zu jerem eigen in Meister. Because in the light of Spirit you know reality. Den nim licht des Geists es erkhenen sie die Realität. So you put your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. This is the center of your mastery. Then you take your hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. This is the center of pure knowledge. Das ist des Zentrum des Rheinen wissens. Now, again you take your hand on to the upper portion of your abdomen. We are showing you now. You can have a look here properly, then we have to close the eyes. Wir zu eigen inen jets wir es kem, wir kein wird bitte Schanzig in nau zu, hinter herr sollten sie die Auge schleesen. Then now you raise your hand again on your heart. Se licht nie hannt ese zu erste auf die Linken overabaucheft und den nau oft des Herrz. Now in the corner of your neck and your shoulder. Schleeslich an den Hals-anzatz auf die Linken Seite. And turn your head to your right. Und drehen sieren kopf nach rechts. To your right. Now this is the center I have already told you catches when you all feel guilty. Ich habe inen Schönge sacht das dieses Zentrum Blokieert wenn sie sich Schuldig vuehen. Now you take your right hand onto your forehead across. Und herzling sie errechte hannt kwer überdich derm. And put down your head. Und boigen sie den kopf. You see the center where you have to forgive everyone in general. Here is the center of wussive geben wissen. Geder Mann ganz aalge mein. Now. Take back your right hand on the back side of your head. And push back your head as far as possible. Nimm sie herzt die rechte hannt zurig auf den Hinter kopf. Link sie den kopf vien ein. Und boigen sie den kopf zur weites geht zurig. Here without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes for your satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness from the Divine Power. Und hier müszen sie, one sich Schuldig zur Fühlen, one ihre Fehle zur Zeyen, nur zu er eignen zur Frieden heid, des Kirtliche umvergebung bin. Now. Please stretch your palm. Und non bitte streichen sie die hant aus, die hant flechen. And put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area, which is a soft bone in your childhood. Und link sie die hant fleche oben auf die Fontanelle, die nierer Kindheit eine Weiche Stelle war. Please bend your head as far as possible. Bitte neigen sie den kopf zur weites geht nach Förner. Now push back your fingers. This is important. Drücken sie die finger nach oben zur uch, so weit es geht, des es wechtig. And now with a great pressure you move your scalp seven times, slowly clockwise. Und mit einem krossen Druk, bewäng sie jetzt, ihre kopf aus, Sieben mal im Kreis im Öhrezeiger zin. Now, that's all we have to do. Des ist alles was wird zu tun haben. If you have anything tight on your waist or on your neck, please remove the tension. Wenn sie engel Kleidung haben, me nierer Thalle oder am nachten zum Beispil, so salten sie des Loken. Also, you can remove your glasses because you have to close your eyes. Sie könn auch die Breller apneem, den sie salt nierer AUGEN jetzt bitte Schlesen. And please don't open your eyes till I tell you. Bitte üfen in Sie AUGEN nicht beföhrig ist inen Sage. Please put the left hand towards me. Streigen sie jetzt die Linke han zuschrimatet je aus. Put the left hand on the heart. Both the feet apart. And now close your eyes. Please see the AUGEN. Here you have to ask Me a fundamental question. You can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji. Please ask Me three times. Mother, am I the Spirit? Here you have to ask Me a very important question. You can call Me Shri Mataji, or Shri Mataji, or Mother. The question is, is it Shri Mataji or Mother? Am I the Spirit? Please ask Me three times. If you are the Spirit, you are your master. So please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen, upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. You are only working on left hand side. And ask Me a question three times. Mother, am I the Spirit? Wenn Sie der Geissen, so sind Sie auegner Meister, Nämen Sie jetzt die Reichehandi nunter, Auf die Linke ober aubaukheftel, Drucken Sie dort und stellen Sie dort die Frage, Drei Mal, Shri Mataji, Uder Mutter, Ben ich mein eigen ammeister. I have already told you that I respect your freedom and you can only get it in the glory of your freedom. I cannot force pure knowledge on you. So you have to now take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen. Here you have to ask six times, because this center has got six petals. Mother, please give me pure knowledge. I cannot force on you. Sex mal, wollt ist ist zentrum, sechs blüten Blätter hat. Because I cannot force on you. Ich kann ine diese Swissen nicht auf zuigen. As soon as you start asking for pure knowledge, you only start rising. So we have to nourish the upper centers with our full self-confidence. So now please raise your right hand, the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and with confidence you have to say ten times, Mother, I am my own master. I have already told you the fundamental truth about this, that you are the spirit. Dächt das die Grund warheit über sie ist, das sie der Geist sind. You are not this body, nor this mind, though our conditionings. But you are the pure spirit. So now raise right hand onto your heart and give your full confidence twelve times, Mother, I am the spirit. I have already told you that this divine power is the ocean of love and compassion. I have already told you that this divine power is the ocean of love and compassion. It is the ocean of absolute knowledge. It is the ocean of absolute wisdom. But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness. So whatever mistakes you might commit can be easily dissolved by the power of this ocean of forgiveness. But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness. And what do you do with your full confidence? You are absolutely and fully aware of this, that this is the ocean of forgiveness. So now will you please raise your hand onto the corner of your neck and your shoulder and put your head to your right. Now here you have to say sixteen times with full confidence, Mother, I am not guilty at all. I have told you whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything. But if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands and you torture yourself. So now raise your hand to your forehead across and put down your head. Here you have to say, not how many times but from your heart, Mother, I forgive everyone. And here you have to say, and this is not really how you say it, but how many times you forgive yourself. Mother, I forgive every one. Now take back your hand on the back side of your head and push back your head. Here without feeling guilty, without counting mistakes, you have to say for your satisfaction, O Divine Power, please forgive me if I have done any mistakes. Now stretch your palm and put the center of your palm on to the fontanel bone area. Here you press it hard and push back your fingers. Here again I cannot cross over your freedom. So move your scalp, asking for self-realization seven times, Mother, give me my self-realization because I cannot force on you. Push back your fingers to put a pressure, push back. Don't hold your head, push back. Press it hard and now move seven times, saying, Mother, please give me my self-realization. Now please remove your hands. Now please remove your hands. Put your hands like this, open your eyes. Now watch Me without thinking. Please put your right hand towards Me like this, come along. Put your right hand towards Me like this and put down your head and see with the left hand if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. Please put down your head. Now please put your left hand towards Me and see with your right hand. Don't put the hand on top of your head but away from it and move it and see. Now put again right hand towards Me and bend your head and see for yourself. Now put your right hand towards Me and bend your head and see. If you are getting hot breeze means you are still not forgiving. Now raise your both the hands towards the sky like this, push back your head. Ask anyone of these three questions three times. Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Divine Love? Mother, is this the Param Chaitanya? Ask anyone of these questions three times. Now take down your hands. Put your hands like this. All those who have felt cool breeze in their hands or on their fingers or out of the fontanel bone area, please raise both your hands. Put your hands on the top of your hands or on your fingers. May God bless you. Most of you have felt it. Some of you felt yesterday and today you didn't feel. You are thinking about it. Don't think, I'll work it out, all right. But in any way I would like to meet you all before you go but don't ask Me too many questions. If you have any problem I'll try to correct it. Thank you.

Can I help? Wow, already. Nice to see so many people there. Lala. Lala. Sam Daniel. That's Daniel. That's Daniel. Sam Daniel. Sam Daniel. And that's Daniel. That's Daniel Feenstra. And that is his wife, Nicole, and granddaughter, Hannah. How nice. Very sweet. How nice. And there's a grandson, Peter. But he's asleep at the moment. He's less than a year. But you live here, isn't it? Yes. Live in Auckland, yes. I didn't see you there. In Hong Kong? No, I would have loved to have been there. I didn't know that they came from New Zealand. From Hamilton. Yes, they're both Kiwis. Hong Kong is on the move. Yeah, I know. It sounds good. We have, suddenly we found a man there, Mr. John. Alex went there. And he started having programs and things. Right. So there are some people who have started coming. Some Chinese also. Chinese are very good, I must say, because, you know this engine, such a lonely person. Last time when I was going, I think when I came to this place, you won't believe, there were thirty-five Chinese met Me at the airport today, I think. And I was so amazed, you see, they had got tickets from Kolarapur. They were in the airport. Again this time they came to see Me. And I said, I'll come. But Kolarapur, we had a nice program also. But imagine all alone, engine was all alone all these days. There's no one. It's done so well. It's all right, you should feel it. It's hard to feel. Now what a nice puja we had, what a nice puja, I imagine. And after the program, I was very happy. I was very happy. I was very happy. Now what a nice puja we had, what a nice puja, I imagine. And after the program, we were seeing, we all started dancing. Everyone, you, all Sahaja Yogis, all of them, just started going round and round. So many of them. Now after dancing they were lost. I think that's the best way to be collected. Are you now all right? Yes, feeling a lot better. It's a bit of a pain in my head sometimes. You still hear problems. Yes, my back is a... I see you, you see, because it's so badly damaged. Absolutely. I said, give him a bandha, we are Sahaja Yogis, all of them. But recently I must tell you, you know, Dr. Khan from Calcutta, somehow or other, I don't know where he got this negativity, but he didn't go to collective for some time or something happened. He went in the bathroom and he just slipped and fell on his back, in the tub. And the whole tub broke, can you imagine? It was so bad and he had a concussion out of the brain. Then they moved him to the hospital and in the hospital he was in intensive care, absolutely unconscious. They telephoned to me, I was in Delhi. I gave him a bandha. Amazingly, next day he was out of the intensive care. They said he cannot be saved, I tell you. Next day, even if they brought him from the intensive care. Then they sent somebody from Pune to look after him and not very far from him. I was twenty minutes, Mother. But you are too young. I was twenty minutes dry. Dry, dry, dry. I was walking up his tightest teeth. Namaste to Mother and Daddy. Giggle. New Zealand should now work it out. I don't know. It's My strong desire that next time you come to New Zealand Mother, you'll be visiting another center, perhaps in the South Island. Really? That's My desire. And I think it's the desire of many others too, whenever it's mentioned there are people who also say, Ah, who's done this? It's a board one. It's a board one. Is it? But it looks like handmade. The continental airlines are on the phone and they want to speak to us. What's that? The continental airlines are on the phone and they want to speak directly to You, Mother. For what? Something to do with luggage. They won't give Me a message. I have no luggage. Where is the telephone? It's all okay. It seems to be okay. What was it they wanted to speak? I have a lot of remarks from you and it's sort of... What was that? I don't know. I just said to you that you picked up your luggage. I just said, Shh. They must be thinking My luggage is left out. Yes. He just said that the luggage had been picked up and that was the end of it. No, I think we had no luggage. It's a small little thing. We brought it together. I said it's two, three days we are going. So why to carry the big box? The Australian girls knew we had your luggage. They were only waiting for the luggage. The Australian girls knew we had your luggage. But they maybe... They must have gone, haan. You know, I didn't bring the box or anything. The reason was that it's such a short time. Already I'm carrying two boxes for three months too. I went from Bombay to... I mean, just to... from Delhi to Bombay and Bombay to Calcutta. Calcutta to Singapore, then Singapore to Perth, Perth to Sydney and then Sydney to Cairns, then to Brisbane from there here. Now the other two is quite like Melbourne, everything. Ultimately from Sydney to Honolulu, from Honolulu to Los Angeles, Los Angeles to New York, New York to London and London to Rome. That's... I will be there for the Sahastrabhut, Rome. So imagine. Hardly any days. Sir, after Kerry is not here, so Kerry, he's travelling the same route. Mother, he's going to Honolulu and Los Angeles and Kerry. But he's... I don't think he's here. Is he? Good. He'll be here soon. That's good. He's coming to Rome. He meets his wife. They were married in India in this last time. He joins his wife for the puja in Rome and then they... Who? Who did he marry? Dr. Defoe. Who did he marry? Dr. Defoe. Dr. Defoe. A French lady, Dr. Defoe. Bernadette Defoe. Very nice French doctor, Bernadette Defoe. Dark, short. Isn't that the Greek boy? Yes, that's Kerry. He's... He's here? He'll be here in a moment. No, he doesn't want to come back. He told Me he doesn't want to come back. Parents are very funny, you see, Greek parents. My love would be Lallita. You see, My name is Lallita also, no? One day. The Miss. Miss. What is Miss? I'm not Miss. You are Miss. Pint lips. Pint lips. Okay. You want to sleep now? You want to sleep? Night. Night. So many children had come to the airport also and when we were going inside the gate they also were walking in with Me. So the policeman said, you go ahead otherwise they'll all walk after you. Hello? Excited, absolutely. How are you? They're very quiet children. They're very quiet. They're very quiet. They're very quiet. They're very quiet children, very quiet. Last year we only had one child in the collective. Yeah. That was Hannah. Now we are, one, two, three, four, five. Five of them. Thank you. Thank you very much. There's a atom, atom, atom. It takes time to take roots, Sahaja Yoga always takes time into collectivity to improve, takes time. Why it improves, guys? New Zealand is a strange situation, I don't know if it's strange but it's unusual, in that there are a large number of New Zealanders who have gained, either gained their realization overseas or have got their realization here, haven't worried about it too much, but as soon as they've got overseas, then started to deepen. It's like a mango tree taken to England. It cannot produce mango and it cannot even produce an apple. It's like that useless thing. But that's something good about New Zealanders, I must say. Well, New Zealanders tend to do quite well overseas but as soon as they go, they tend to settle down and become quite good contributors to the society which they join and often become quite responsible people, more responsible overseas many times than they are here. I don't know why it is but New Zealanders seems to gain more confidence when they go overseas. But one thing about Indians that when they go abroad, they always stop the lists in the universities and they are very rich, very well-to-do, some or other, when they go abroad. But as far as spirituality is concerned, they become no good. And it seems to be the other way with New Zealanders. There are a lot of New Zealanders in Australia, in fact. May I pardon? There are a lot of New Zealand Sahaja Yogis in Australia. Really? More New Zealand more. Including power. And what about England also we have? A lot of New Zealanders are in England, yes. There were a number of New Zealanders there that had quite key posts like the head of the television news was a New Zealander at one time, and various members of Parliament, key academic figures at universities. The Sahaja Yogis also there have quite a lot. Now England is doing well, I must say, it's very simple. It took so much time, so much energy, everything, but I must say it's now very good. A little while ago I was talking to David Spyro and I said, how things go in England? And he paused for a moment and said, very nicely. Which is difficult, I mean, which really meant very, very well. Yes, that's, they say little bit under tombs. He's a very fine person, I've found him. So good, very nice. After all the mishaps, it's very good. Australia had many more mishaps than anywhere else. I don't know what's the unfortunate thing about it, I can't explain. That may be the reason. That's the, that's the, our only approach to dedication to you is through Ganesha. In Australia a museum would be there. That might be the reason. But leadership itself let Me down so badly. Unbelievable things, I mean, you see, really unbelievable things they did. I mean, even a normal person won't do such a thing as crooked things they have done. Really, I can't understand such a crickety thing. I trusted them so much. Despite that today Australia is one of the big things of. Only now they have problem of money because of this, whatever is happening. So we have that in common. But they do not expand. I think as I was talking to you, we'll have to think about it, something will happen. There's so much dearth of things all over the world and you have the surplus. We could provide a lot of nations with wool and butter and cheese and farm products. From good farms, from good farms that look lush and green and are well cared for and well rained upon by Mother Nature. Thank you. I'll play the Shri Kailana with you. What happened? I think take out the shoes, they'll be better off. They don't like to be tied up. It's coming out well, you see, very clear. There's light more on the right, less. This side is more and also it's different, not looking as it is, looking different. It's very clear. Now it's better. Now the face is normal, otherwise it's looking very big. I don't think there's need to have any light like that. There's no need to have any light. It's quite nicely, very clear. I think it's better. There's no need to have any light. It's quite nicely, very clear. Can't quite see the eyes, Mother. It's very clear. The face one can see but one can't quite see the eyes in that light. Now you can. And the eyes, even I open, see the lights. See the whole face changes. See? Better not open them too much. Yes, you could put it up like that, you see, would be better. You can push it up like that, would be better. Just falling on the cheeks, you see, towards making it. That is quite traditional, Mother. What is to put on the face? You read in technical books. What? Soft light in this direction, a hard one from that. So, but why do I have to? You have to have calcium. You have to have calcium. You have to have calcium. What is it? Doodles. You have to have calcium. You have to have calcium. You have to have calcium. If it drops, it will be too much. You have to have oil. You have to have, God, your oil, so on. The vitamin A and D. Drops it. Calcium and vitamin A and D, that's very good. Calcium, vitamin A and D. That's good for children. Ah, it's like a variety. Apandha deva shrimatte dana. Apandha deva dana. But bharangah, khanda hai thune, madhatte pune, kaalisodha. Kaalisodha pune. Kaalisodha pune. Shri Mataji, nastan paas mita nahi bhai baharali, phane ki pong kili, phong kili. Tere mahale ki, kannu chala kapant kuncha manjas saman bhi nahalat man. Madhas samay. There are like duntin bags, hota hai barobha. Kine kana yawala gillapas. Bagish karta. But yawala kana sodap nohte, teeny bhi nana. Nand ter paas jamita dhamlo, nahin aapne dehgillau, nahi bhi chawla, mujha security wala kiya pudam, aam bhai bhai aayathta gillaye. Aayathta gillaye, ani aaj teen nahin aaththamolay, ter karan kaya hai, kum kaya karajas hanga. Maa karajas matani aala mani ki bhathodh nihat keta hai. Maha hai, bhai rale, noh mohale ki aapna samana se rakhi noht aki ala kina hai. Tere ista kya confusion muna hai, tan atlas hai, ki bhi madhas samana hai, lau kina hai nahi lau monun. Tasa kaini. Tana mai toh, you should have told these girls that we have taken, they don't know about My luggage. So they must have asked that what about her luggage, My luggage. So the people got worried, they said, please call her and ask her if she has taken her luggage or not. Jahan rati bhai. Nahi seu de toh, it's a sight lait hai, samana sata chek, una lama, no? Ka doosha rade na nahi te paro makte hai. Dar rade hai, ture hai. Tana deyathun mali sande kar ait se rosh, olive oil shiv. Rati zhopai chadi, olive oil shiv malais. Ankhine hai, kabzo rahe thoda hai. Hote ki kya? Pa means love. Atha. For onionsar, for saforts, there is no other way. Shri Mataji, we were waiting for your Samsonite bags and I didn't know that they'd gone already to Sydney. I thought they were being off loaded in the water. How can I not believe that? How can I not believe that? I'm sure you are not going to believe that. I didn't know that they'd gone already to Sydney. I thought they were being off-loaded in Auckland. Oh, I told you I haven't got a baggage. Only for two days I thought what's the use of carrying that Samsonite. So they've travelled in a right railway. So tomorrow we've decided to have the puja. I mean I don't know when they will be ready about say, I say ten o'clock but it's never before twelve I've seen. I'll be ready by ten. But you know because of the, you have to prepare such a lot, you see. Take it easy. Right side, Atila. She's a quiet child compared.

This song was written by one very great poet called as Namadeva in the 16th century and we had many poets who sang about Kundalini. This Namadeva has sung this song saying that, I will ask for the yoga from Mother. This song was written in the 16th century by a great poet called Namadeva. And Namadeva, in this song, says, I would like to ask for the Kundalini, I mean divine. And then he was called by Shri Nanak Sahib, the guru of the sick people. And his poems are included in the Granth Sahib, which is the holy book for the sick. In the 16th century all these saints came together. And they all talked about Kundalini. But as usual the people who were in charge of so called religion all tortured them. Same thing happened with the Gnostics from the Christians. And we, the Sahaja Yogis, are the Gnostics of today. The word Gn comes from Sanskrit meaning the knowledge. Knowledge of the Divine. Also the Gnostics were tortured. So it's a same story. And in the Islam Gnostics are called Talim, Talim, to have the deep knowledge. Also he said it clearly, Mohammed Sahib, that without knowing yourself you cannot know God. Can you imagine the so called Muslims, what they are doing, and so called Christians and so called Hindus? We have many Muslims now with us and many many more Christians and of course many Indians, Russians. Now I hope we'll be having many Portuguese from Portugal, not only from Brazil. Thank you very much because it's one religion which is innate, which is for truth. They all want to have different religions because they can fight. They don't want to have one religion. So this is what it is. All religions are to be worshipped and to be understood. In reality they are going. Thank you very much.

Music Applause What are they doing? They are saying what? Where are they? They are saying what? Where are they? I bow to all the seekers of truth. You are all seekers of truth but we sometimes don't know what we are seeking. And whatever I am going to tell you, you shouldn't accept it blindfolded. We have had too much problem with blind faith. Today I am going to talk to you about enlightenment, about your second birth, which is promised in the Bible. Christ has said you are to be born again. That means the evolutionary process should give you that new birth. It's not just a certificate here that we are born again. If you are born again then you must have powers of a born again personality. Otherwise it is like any other level we bear. There is some happening that has to take place. Unfortunately He has not told you about the subtle instrument within us which does that. So what is the truth? The truth is that we are not this body, it is mine. His conditionings. We are not this ego but we are pure spirit. And unless and until you become the spirit the ignorance about seeking won't go. To become the spirit we have within us built in the whole mechanism. There is a power, residual power called as Kundalini in the triangular bone. This power when is awakened in the evolutionary process you become a higher human being. Every human being has this power. As long as you are a human being you have a right to get this awakening. And then you get connected to this all pervading power of Divine love. You see these flowers? We take it for granted. These flowers are different, they are different, they have different fragrance. Who does this miraculous work? You will say the Mother Earth. That means the Mother Earth thinks. That means there is some power which does all living work. If you ask a doctor who runs your heart, he'll say it's an autonomous nervous system. But what is this auto? Who is this one? For example if you car a car automobile the auto is the driver. So who is this driver? Doctors can't answer. They are honest. Because they don't know. But awakening this Kundalini you don't have to stand on your head or go to Himalayas. You don't have to starve and do all kinds of rituals. It is spontaneous. Sahaja means with, jaja is born. Born with you is the right to get enlightenment. And yoga means the union with the Divine power. That is how we become Divine. This is not physical yoga, it is spiritual yoga I am talking about. Now this is also mentioned in the Bible. It said that I'll appear before you like tongues of flames. These centers that you see are those tongues of flames. And these are all within your nervous system. Brain and your medulla oblongata as they call it. All right. So this Kundalini is waiting to be awakened. She is your mother. She knows everything about you. Is all recorded in her. She knows your past and she knows your future. Now according to Bible it is written there is Trinity. There is Father and there is the Son and the Holy Ghost. There is no Mother. But everywhere in Christian communities people worship the Holy Mother. They can't do without the Mother. So there is a big controversy if they should have four persons. Actually Holy Ghost is the Mother, is the Primordial Mother. When Vasco de Gama went to India Vasco de Gama came back and told the king that they are all Christians. They are not Muslims. He said how do you know they are Christians? Because they don't worship the Father like the Muslims but they worship the Mother. So in those days the Portuguese used to worship the Mother. This is some or other diverted. I don't know why. That there is no place for Mother in the Bible. Thus people get confused. But actually the Holy Ghost is the Mother. And the reflection of that Holy Ghost is the Kundalini. And She is residing in the triangular bone called as the sacrum. That means it's a sacred bone. That means also that the Greeks knew it was a sacred bone. I was surprised in Greece there is Athena. Athena means the Primordial. She was the Primordial Mother. And She has Kundalini in Her stomach, on Her shield. And if you go to Parspolis they tell you this is the temple of the Mother. There are so many signs to show that they knew the knowledge of Kundalini. Even in Russia I found they knew about it. Ukraine knew about it. And they said that two saints came from India who told us about it. Of all the places Bolivia and Colombia. There are on the pottery three and a half coils made everywhere. And there are in Bolivia people who know this knowledge. Can you imagine? They have this knowledge but now it is lost. Now the time has come. I call it the Blossom Time. But it is the resurrection time described in the Bible. But now you have to be resurrected. You have to become the Spirit. And what is the sign that you feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost in your hands and on top of your head? This is the actualization of your baptism. You should now not live blindly. You have to keep your eyes open to see that you get the truth. You should not waste your life believing in something. Which is not the truth. For example, how are we sure that Christ was the Son of God? There is big fight going on on that point. But He was the Son. Once you get this cool breeze in your hand you know the absolute truth. So when you ask the question, was Christ the Son of God? Immediately you will find cool breeze blowing into you. If it is falsehood you will get tingling, you might get burning. Surprisingly Mohammed Sahib has said it clearly at the time of resurrection your hands will speak. But what do you see of the religion? Like Jews, Islam and Christians came from the same root. But they are a dagger's hand. They are killing each other. They are also killing among themselves. Why, why? If you know the truth you will know that you belong to the same truth. Luckily we have now people in 75 or something more countries where they have got their realization. Because with this happening what happens all your foolish eyes all your ideas, blind ideas, stupid ideas all drop out. Many people who used to take drugs and used to drink and all kinds of nonsense have given up overnight. All the evil of racialism and all kinds of special ideas about oneself all that drops out. I am sorry I came to Portugal long time back once. But the Portuguese didn't take Me seriously. But in Brazil we have thousands. Even the ministers and the prime minister and also the mayor are very open and very spiritual minded. Last time I went there the mayor came to the airport. He had a ceremony and he gave Me the keys of Brasilia. I was told that only 5% Portuguese are left here, all the rest are in Brazil. But that's not the thing. I was going all over like I went to Argentina, to Brazil, to China, to all over the places but I thought that still Portuguese have to come up in Portugal. After so many years I have come back. They told Me that in Portugal many Indians have come and they are not at all spiritual. They are extremely materialistic and very westernized so they don't give a good example. Maybe some of them are good but shaky time. They have forgotten all their tradition. Not that they are Christians, they are Hindus. But they have forgotten the basis of Hinduism is Self-realization. You can give it any name to it Nirvana or you can call Moksha, any name. But the people on the whole I found are very innocent. But they are very innocent. They are faithful and they can easily become Self-realized. First sign of Self-realization that you get joy. Joy is not like happiness or unhappiness, it's singular. As I told you drop out all your bad habits, destructive habits. But also you become very good in health. These chakras are responsible for your physical, mental and emotional being. Sahaja yoga has cured all kinds of diseases but we don't have to go to doctors. You have power cures and first you get your Self-realization. Then you can give realization to others, you can cure others and you know about others chakra also. Your awareness becomes transformed. You have only one word for awareness, for everything. It's a French word, French style. There is a big discussion going on amongst Portuguese philosophers because we have too many. With the French? More than the French and more complicated than the French in that sense. All right, awareness is much deeper. And that is, that you know about your own centers, the Self-knowledge and you know about the center of others. So you develop a collective consciousness. By this collective consciousness you can diagnose your own problems and problems of others. Now if you can correct your own centers you can correct the center of others. For which you don't have to pay. For this happening you don't have to pay. You must know that God doesn't understand money. He doesn't understand banking. He doesn't know about Wall Street. So you cannot pay for your ascent. That is just a blessing of the Divine. Because it is anxious now to give you your Self-realization. Then when the Kundalini rises above this center, this is the center of Christ, rises above this Gauraya, then you become thoughtlessly aware. There's no thought. If you want you can think. But there's no thought. You are absolutely at peace with yourself and with others. You develop that witness state. And in that peace you achieve peace of the whole world. All these wars, all these conflicts start in the brain of human beings. But if you become absolutely peaceful then how can there be wars? Who is the other in collective consciousness? Who is the other? You are part and parcel of the whole. Like this finger won't fight with this finger. And so now in Sahaja Yoga, for your information, we have people from all races, from all religions, from all nations, and so in Sahaja Yoga we have people from all races, from all religions, all enjoying love and beauty of others. It's a very big subject. I thought he would have covered half, he didn't. But you can know about it. It's better to become the Spirit and then know. It's better to become the Spirit and then know. It is more inside. So we don't also give books, otherwise they start reading like Bible, line by line. By reading you do not become. Becoming is the point. If you cannot become then it's useless. So I would request you to be there for about more than fifteen minutes and get your Self Realization. But if you are critical it doesn't work out. Because you see Kundalini is the pure desire. Pure desire is the big desire. You become the Spirit. But if you are critical it doesn't work out. If you have any questions after Realization you can write to Me. Those who don't want to have Self Realization should leave the hall. Because I cannot force it on you. It's not convergent. It's not convergent. No, no, no, no. It's a becoming. All right, I'll wait for one minute. Those who want to leave can leave. One minute. Those who want to leave can leave. All of you want to have it? It's very remarkable. You all will have to know that is no mesmerism. In mesmerism people put their eyes into others and mesmerize. On the contrary it is knowledge. It's very deep knowledge about yourself and about others. I would request you all to put your hands like this. Before that if you could take out your shoes this Mother Earth will help us a lot. Now please put both the hands towards Me. Like this, like this. This is for asking that you have to feel the vibrations on your fingertips. These are five, six and seven centers. Now please put both your hands. The left hand has got the emotional side and the right side has got the physical and the mental side. Also you can close your eyes if you like or you can take out your spectacles. Please close your eyes. Just for a second. Now please open your eyes and put the left hand towards Me and put the right hand on top of your head. On the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood. Now try to see if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. Now please put the right hand towards Me and put the left hand on top of the fontanel bone area and see if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head. Now put both the hands on top of your head like this and now ask one of these questions three times in your heart. First question, Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? Any one of these questions I said three times in your heart. Now the second question is, Mother, is this the all pervading power of God, Ruh? Third question is, Mother, is this the Param Chaitanya? Now take down your hands please. Keep them on your lap. Be comfortable. Now watch Me without thinking. Now all those who have felt cool breeze on the fingertips or on the palm or out of the bone area raise your hand. Let Him translate then. Both the hands, both the hands. Wow! Look at the Portuguese. I bow to you all. Your sensual life has started. There are very few who haven't got it. We'll get it. We'll get it. All of them they'll get it. You have to come to our center. No money paid, no money. You don't have to pay anything. And some people have to develop it more because it has to grow now. Then you become master of yourself. You can raise the Kundalini. You can give realization. You can look after people. And in every way you'll be blessed. Thank you very much. Would you like to sing one song? Just enjoy. Now these are people of different rationality. Absolutely. Thank you. Just in time. Enjoy yourself. Come in. Sit down. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Come in. Has sent this song saying that I will ask for the yoga from Mother. And then he was called by Shri Nanak Sahab, the guru of Sikh people. And his poems are included in the Granth Sahab, which is the holy book for the Sikhs. In the sixteenth century all these saints came together. And they all talked about yoga. But as usual the people who were in charge of so called religion all tortured them. Same thing happened with the Gnostics from the Christians. And we the Sahaja Yogis are the Gnostics of today. Now word Gn comes from Sanskrit meaning the knowledge. Knowledge of the Divine. Also the Gnostics were taught. So it's a same story. And in the Islam Gnostics are called Dali, Taaleem, Quran, to have the deep knowledge. Also he said it clearly, that without knowing yourself you cannot know God. Can you imagine the so called Muslims what they are doing and so called Christians and so called Hindus? We have many Muslims now with us and many, many more Christians and of course many Indians, Russians. Now I hope we'll be having many Portuguese from Portugal, not only from Brazil. Thank you very much because it's one religion which is innate, which is for truth. They all want to have different religions because they can fight. They all want to have different religions because they can fight. They don't want to have one religion. So this is what it is. All religions are to be worshipped and to be understood. In reality they are going. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

The program throughout was very good, I must say. The girls danced so well in a folk dancing style. And also later on we had a very good dancer who did Kuchipudi and the another one who was, I think, from the South, who did the same. They were all very enjoyable and the most interesting thing is that the ones who are coming from Russia, Talyati, all of them are absolutely unknown to Indian music and Indian art. I just cannot understand how can within two months these people can pick up this classical music which is a very, very difficult thing. People have to work for years together to get to this level. They say it is all the blessings of Sahaja. To Me it's a miracle, absolutely a miracle and what a pleasant miracle it is. If it can make such great artists, there's no way. We can really appreciate the miracle of the Divine and the Divine music. Now coming to the second part, as you have heard Avi, as usual he is an extremely creative person. I don't know if he was creative before coming to Sahaja Yoga or after coming to Sahaja Yoga or in My presence, I just don't know. But I haven't heard even such a good sitar player so far, heard. Now words can describe the beauty of his creativity and the amount of joy he gives to all of us. Perhaps maybe that Western people understand instrumental music better. But now today's Arunabhata's rendering was another climax of the vocal music, I must say. It's such a wonder to see such tremendous creativity pouring out in such a surge manner. Indian music has to be surge. First you have to learn. You have to learn about all the notes and all the rhythms. You have to really know them very well. But once you sit before the audience, it's your own realm, it's your own style. You have to keep to the discipline of the ragas, no doubt. But otherwise you can go and fly all over. As these two great artists did today, I'm really amazed. I don't know what to say about Arunabhata. He's turning out to be one of the greatest singer now. And such like many other I have heard before. And he's doing so much better than all of them, I think now. Because he just floats and makes you all float into heavenly music. I think they are especially blazed to create such joy for all of you, for all the Sahaja Yogis. I wish them all good luck. I respect them very much also because people get art as a blessing of God, no doubt. Any art, specially music and dancing and all these rhythmic arts, they get it through the rhythm of Shri Mahadeva. But to render them in such a beautiful manner, whether you are Westerners or whether you are from Australia or from any place, you just get enthralled. Like the flute of Shri Krishna is something, the greatest blessing of Sahaja Yoga. I bless all of them, all the artists from My heart. And I'm not still very well and still the music has kept Me so much enthralled and so much submerged into the depth of the Divine blessings. May God bless you all and tomorrow is the wedding day. Those who are getting married, the girls, have to come to the stage, I don't know where, because they have to be put, those Mendhi on their hands. They have to keep it for the whole night till tomorrow. So I hope all the brides will come on the stage. All those who haven't got the sarees also should collect the sarees. Ramanj, come here. Come here. I'll come here. What's your name? Haldi, right? Yes, he's from Ustkhebagh. Is he coming tomorrow? Tomorrow I don't know the timing, I'm very bad at time. But Yogi is asking me the time. So I would say that we could come for the Haldi about say 10 o'clock all of you, have the Haldi on and in the evening about say we could start the wedding little earlier, say about 6 o'clock, that's Sutsi or 7 o'clock and because it should not get very late, tomorrow is Amavasya. Is the dark night what you call Amavasya? New Moon. No, no, no. New kaslo? Andarai? No, no. New Moon manjya hai bhi karo. Amavasya la shabdene hai re? New Moon kaso manai. New Moon kaso manai. Sabanda deewa sei Amavasya. The day when there is no Moon, now what? It's till 11, 11 something, so it starts. So we have to finish the marriages before that. So if we start about say 6 will be better. We can start it at 6 o'clock, the boys have to come to a temple and the girls have to be here for the Gauri Puja. This time we don't have many marriages as we used to have, only I think 65 marriages are there. This time we had also very much less people for our complete tour. So next year I have decided not to have this tour anymore. You can only come to Ganpati Puri. Because it's too much expensive to have these tours for the small number of people. So I think this is the last tour you have had and you have gone through all the places of India. And I would request you just to come for this Ganpati Puri program, will be alright. Also, Baba mama will tell you about My birthday, they want to celebrate in a big way, I don't know what to say. But I wish you all a very joyous and happy weddings to the people who are getting married. Thank you very much, may God bless you. May God bless you.

Sorry, Kevin. Yes, I see. and that the modules are generated by different qualities, such as the birth of our lives, qualities of our own lives, qualities of our own country. And all of this is at the end of the day, and all of this is at the end of the day, at the end of the day, this is the point of beauty. This is what we call how we perceive life. It's like how we see. We see ourselves as our own, and we see what we believe, what we believe in, what we believe in, and we see how we see, how we see, how we see. There is no consequence of the state of this kind of result. This is the end of the content. And then, in the same way, our physical and our physical programs, and I would like to say this in a way that represents, in the same way, how we perceive our own problems, physical, or radical problems, that are in the same way as in the same way as in the same way. And, in our physical programs, this is the beginning of the state of this kind of result. And what we also see, and what we also see, is the fact that we have to use the things that we have, the tools, and everything that is needed, such as a normal environment in which we are able to use the tools, and what we are able to do, is to use the tools that are in the field, that are conventional, and what we are able to do is to respond, in the way that physical programs respond to the state of our problem in the state of the field. And so, this is the kind of result that is the This is the kind of result that is the most important result. And the root of this, the root of this, is the sense of the human sense, and all the other things that we have to do. But the reality is that, what we have to do, what we have to do is to define this the idea of the basic techniques, to achieve something. All of this is a part of our community, and we are able, and this is what everyone knows, to be able to pretend, to be able to see, to be able to understand, to be able to perform things. We have to be able to be confident in our own interior, and also to be able to do what is possible, and we must do things that are possible. And even if it is possible, we must do things that are possible, that are not just disciplines, and we must do things that can change things. But I would say that all the things that can change the world are what the idea of a level that is terminal, that is a level of love. That is a level that is not a path that we can take from the human level. But I would say that in our own level, and in our own lives, in the universe, in the universe we can be the level of life, from which we can be aware. That is what the world is, and what the world is, is the connection between the world and life. We are human beings, we are human beings, we are human beings, and we are living beings, we are human beings. We don't have any of this kind of contact. And the reality is, because we do not have any connection, because we do not have any separation between us, we have to be there. And the way we are able to be able to be there is the same thing. We do not have any connection between us. And what we do know is that the connection between us and the world is the connection between us and the universe. And the world is the connection between us. The world is the connection between us and the world. And the way we can be aware is that we can be able to be more sensitive and have a less passive relationship and have a more authentic relationship, and for many people that is a very important one, but also we can be Sadhguru, we can be Sadhguru, we can be the Sadhguru, we can be Sadhguru, we can be Sadhguru of the world, we can be Sadhguru, but we are always the Sadhguru, we are always Sadhguru. And I think that's the most important thing. It's a transformation that is produced in a way that is not suitable in the creative world. So the divine is pointing to the heart of our human being. It's pointing to the heart. And that is the meaning. It's a beautiful, spectacular mind. But it's the beginning of a total transformation. In the same way, it's a spectacular mind. And it's a transformation that has to be created as an experience, an element, an entity. And in the same way, it has to be as a whole, and as a whole, as a whole, as a whole. And it's pointing to the world living. And the mind is the character. There is a sensation that is physical. And it's the sense of being something. It's the sensation that is very simple, but it's the sensation of being something else. And that's important to us. So we have to know what is the real question. And what is the life of the human being. In this way, we have to do the same thing in the way that we are in the same way. We have to do the same thing in the way that we are in the same way. We have to explain a little bit more about what is the aspect of the human being. We have to understand that the human being is not only a force, but also a force that is more in the brain. And that is the brain that represents the situation of our connection to the living. In what way, in what way, in what way, in which way, in this way, we are connected with the normal, that is the brain. This is the way we live in the brain. We live in the brain, but we are not. We are not perfect. As we have said, that when we are in the brain, it is more than the brain. And the way the photographic camera works is in the brain. So, in our brain, we have to do the same thing, because the brain has to be connected to the same thing, to the same things, and the same thing. We have to understand that in some areas, the brain represents one of the aspects that are represented in the brain, the mind, that is the form of the conscious, the truth, that the camera is the audience. The camera is the object of the whole thing, the whole thing, the whole thing, the whole thing. The brain is the object of the whole thing. There is a very important point that I would like to share with you, that I would like to use this to explain. And I want to tell you, that this is something that is important for the world, for the people who are living here, and those who are living here, who are living here, who are living here, who are living here, who are living here, and that the whole thing is the object of the whole thing. That is the part of the brain that is represented in the brain, that is the part of the brain that is represented in the brain. And this is what I would like to share with you. And I would like to give you this point. When I was in high school, I was on the ground, and they were making me see these types of things and the halfway fire, they weretaker of Jupiter, and Saiyanshana is one of them. if you view anything more explicit or Do you have a certain sense of that connection to this event?

They are the most important people. Thank you. to move the fire escape dancing ometal and this is the way that we are going to live. This is the way that we are going to live. This is the way of our own lives, so that we can live. And it is also the way that we are going to live, because of our education and our transformation, so that we can learn that the life that we live in is connected with the living. It is very difficult. If we are in this world, this is difficult. And we are not going to live in the world, we are going to live with the elements, we are going to live with our own lives. Here, I am not going to tell you the idea, but if you tell me that you are in the world, all of your transformation in the energy, in total energy, and in the energy of the body, the symbol of the energy, that is what you have in mind, to be able to live in the world, in the world of energy, in the world of energy, but you are not going to live in the world. And here, I am going to tell you the idea, and I am going to tell you the idea. And I will tell you the idea, and I will tell you the idea, because I don't know if you know the idea, but we can talk about it, and I will tell you the idea here. So, when you are in the world, you are living in the world, you are living in the world, and you are living in the world. And here, I will tell you the idea, because I think this represents, I think, something like this. I think something like this. And I think that if you tell me, in the world of energy, you have a relationship with the thing that you are living in. So, I think you will see the idea. When you tell me that you are in the world, you will see the idea, and the idea. And you will see it. And you will see it. And you will see that it is difficult. And the idea of being in the world is to be able to see what you are living in. And to be able to be in the world with it. And that is the idea. And I think that the idea of being in the world is the idea of being in the world, the ideas, the ideas of energy, and when we are in the world, we will see our own connection. And the way we connect is through the consciousness. We must understand the sense of connection and the sense of connection. We must understand the sense of connection. And that is the idea. But it is also an interesting idea because there are many ideas. This is a book. And here, you see this book of the one day, the day of the santora. The day is like the day of the day that the santora is put in the environment, in the environment of the human being. In the planet. In the environment of the human being. The santora is a point that marks the ultimate goal of the human being. And it is a very important goal and it is a very important goal because it is a very important goal. And this goal is a very important goal. A very important goal is a goal that is not only to be accessible to the human being, but also to be able to be able to live and to be able to live in the world. And now, I have this mission. This mission is to introduce humanity in a way that is beautiful. And this mission is to make the world and the world feel the humanity. And this is the central goal of the santora. To be able to create a world that is more than just a situation and the world is more than just a planet. This santora is a very important goal and it is a very important goal because we have a very important goal and this is a very important goal. It is the most important goal and the most important goal. If we can create a world that is more than just a planet we can do this because we are the only ones and we are the only ones who can do it. And here, this is the central goal that is the mission of the santora. And here, I say that I want to make a world that is more than just a planet. And here, I want to make a world that is more than just a planet. I want to make a world that is more than just a planet. Because we have to do this because we are the only ones who can do it. This is the central goal. And this is the only one, but I want to make it more than just a planet. And this is the central goal. This is the land that I want to live in. This is the central goal. This is the land of the santora. This is the center of the planet. This part is However, with... stretched out ... it becamege t the no matter lights and ray Cr right way for the no matter ray among i nights e bit the e e click all uh... uh... i got it and the way in which the world is changing, the way in which the world is changing, all these are the manifestations of this planet, of this planet. And also, when I ask you, when I open up, what is the relationship with the world, with the knowledge of the world, and this vital area, the situation is diverse. This channel has inspired us to understand the importance of this in our own society. We have this channel, and we have our own website, and we have the digital version, which has helped us with the research, and we have the access to the future. And this is the reality, these are the aspects of the energy, and what I have to ask you, and I want to ask you, is what makes us different from time? Is it the path to the world? We are talking about various things, we are trying to accelerate the world and to us, and we are not in the present. We are not in the present. Because in present, there is a person who is in the present in the real world. And we are not going to do that because there is a gap in the world, and we are not going to do that. We are going to continue to pass on and continue to do the future in our present. So, the solution, this is the idea that we can do this in the real world, and we can do this in the real world. And I think that is the reason why we are trying to accelerate the world in the real world. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Can I please? I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the very outset, I have to say that truth is what it is. We cannot think about it. We cannot conceptualize it. Nor can we change it. It has been, it is, and it will be. We cannot think about it. We cannot conceptualize it. S is se ran. Unfortunately at this human awareness, you cannot feel the Divine. You have to become the Spirit. The truth is, you are not this body, this mind, this ego, these conditionings. But you are the pure Spirit. And unless and until you become the Spirit, you can never be satisfied with yourself. Now whatever I am going to tell you, you have to understand that this is for you is a hypothesis but for me is gravity. In case this hypothesis works out, then you have to accept the reality as honestly. So you have to accept the reality as honestly. And you have to accept the reality as honestly. So you have to keep your mind open as a scientist. Till you discover the science of the Divine, you cannot talk about it. There is another truth that there is an all-pervading power of Divine love which does all giving work. You see all these beautiful flowers here, which we do not understand is a miracle. We take it for granted. Look at your eyes. What a camera it is. But we take it for granted. What about our brain? Which is a computer, a perfect computer, but we also take it for granted. If you ask a doctor who runs your heart, he will say it is an autonomous nervous system. But who is this autonomous? So what we find that even science is not conclusive. You may be able to make your cake fast or you may be able to have a better train. But it is not going to answer the question what is the meaning of your life. So that as your seekers you turn to religion. But you find that the so-called religions also are only money oriented or power oriented. They are not spirit oriented at all. While all those religions were born on the same tree of spirituality. But these people have plucked the flowers and now are fighting with those dead flowers. They are all fundamentalist. Because they think they are the best and they have a right to fight each other. You can see what's happening in the girl, you can see what's happening in Yugoslavia. Also Azerbaijan and other things, so many places they are just fighting and killing people in the name of God. This cannot be. God is love. So that you start thinking what is wrong, why should we not have the Divine within ourselves. The Divine is within you already present. Is present in all of you. In a potential state and it cannot be destroyed. It cannot be destroyed. It cannot be destroyed. Because it is of eternal nature, it cannot be perished. That is within you all the time and now the time has come for you to feel the truth. This is the truth that is within us. Now we have to take the moment that we feel eternal. I am happy that Jose has told you all about this subtle system that is within us. I am happy that Jose has told you all about this subtle system that is within us. Is this hell in Bible also that the tree of life. Also it is said that I will appear before you like tons of flames. Is I what you see are the tons of flames on top, you can see that like a lotus. All He said that I will appear before you like tons of flames. All the others have got flicks like lotus. All the world problems, if you see, are costly because of human beings. And all the human problems are because of their centers in trouble. So if by some means you can put these centers right, then all the problems will be finished. So when this power rises through these centers, then it nourishes these centers, strengthens them and integrates them with each other. And perimeters through your for today in Bona area, actualization, again I say actualization of your baptism. It's not just somebody putting the hand on your head, now you have become a Christian. Or you have become a Hindu or a saint or a Christian. Or you have become a Hindu or a saint. Whatever religion you may come from, whether Christianity, Hinduism, Sikhism, any religion, Buddhism, you can commit any mistakes. You do not become a saint. You have all the weaknesses as others have common to everyone. We have to understand that something has to happen to us. So this is the evolutionary process. Now you have become human beings and if you move on journey from that to the Bona area, you become the Spirit. So Sahaja Yogis, Sahaja Yogis with Jove is born. Born with you is the right to get this union with this all-pervading power. It is a spontaneous happening and you can't pay for it. You cannot pay for this knowledge also. You don't have to go to Himalayas, you don't have to start and fast. Sitting on your chairs you can get your Self-realization. It is as simple as that. Because the time has come. I call it a blossom time. But in the Bible it's called as the last judgment. In the Quran it is said at the time of Qiyamah, resurrection time, your hands can speak and we tell you what's wrong with you. So you yourself will judge yourself. This happening is absolutely available to everyone. Now in short I'll tell you the nature of the Spirit. Firstly I told you that when this Kundalini rises, She solves your physical, mental, emotional and spiritual problems. And this instrument had to be connected to the mains, otherwise it has no meaning. You are fantastic, you are glorious, only your community has to manifest. You have to be fantastic and glorious. Only you have to know that the community has to manifest. Like if you take a small box of television in a village, in a remote village of India, then you think it's just a box. And if you tell them that you can see all kinds of films in it, then somehow can it be just a box. That is also the way we think about ourselves. But once it is connected to the mains, they see it is fantastic. In the same way when we are connected to the mains, we realize how fantastic you are. Now for your information, there are already three doctors in their university who have got their MD for curing incurable diseases. No doubt, we have cured many blood cancer patients and all kinds of mentally upset people. It's not that we do it, but your own power which is within you does it. Also people give up their habits. Overnight I have seen in England people who are drug addicts, overnight they give up their habits. We have, Sir, you are working now fifty-five minutes. We have been working for fifty-five years. Say in Russia, in one small little place, we have twenty-two thousand practicing surgeons. Their government was bad, but the people are like a clean slate, they are not conditioned. But I must say with great regrets that I have been to Spain since long, but Spain is the weakest country as far as the challenges go. When I had come first time, I stayed with our master here, and I met the Queen of Spain. She was telling me that this fourteen-year-old guru who was taking from them Rolls Royces, there were fifty thousand Spanish people following, so that we must have discretion to know what is the reality and what is not. You cannot purchase your guru. This one must understand, and if you understand that this is the grace of God, the love of God that works out, you will understand that you cannot pay for love. This one must understand that this is the grace of God, the love of God, you will understand that you cannot pay for love. So now the Spirit, when your Kundalini comes out of your continental area, She touches the place which we call as the office, you can say, pita, of the Spirit which is on top of the head you have here. But the Spirit resides in the heart, and when your attention becomes enlightened by the Spirit, then your attention becomes active. That means you can feel on your central nervous system the chakras that are yours and the chakras of others. That means you develop a new dimension of your awareness, which we call as collective consciousness. It is not just you certify that I am born again, but you get powers with it. You, if you know how to correct those centers, and if you know how to correct the centers of others, you can solve their problems. But wherever your attention goes, it becomes really innocent. There is no lust and there is no greed. What Christ has said, now shall not have a doctor's eyes. How many Christians have such eyes? When you put your attention onto somebody, this innocence acts and can cure that person, can give peace to that person, can do marvelous things. All the devilish things we are doing, nowadays I hear so much of this child abuse and all that, that the police have abused children, 200 children in America. All this just disappears. I think this is worse than that chamber. For poor children. Now all these things that have crawled into our society, just get cleansed when there are people with such innocence and compassion. With this light of the Spirit shining in you, you become extremely dynamic and extremely compassionate, because you are all the time in connection with this whitely energy. The nature of the Spirit is that it's a universal being. So you forget the limitations of your past, your community, your race, your nationality and you become a universal being. Like the drop across the ocean. And there is no more problem of all these useless things by which we are divided into sects. The greatest thing about the Spirit is that it gives you the absolute truth. See, for example, you all are seeing Me sitting here, there's no argument about it. In the same way you can feel it on your fingertips, all of you the same thing. Somebody says he doesn't believe in God. Let him ask a question, is there God? They will all feel on their fingertips, on their hands, a tremendous breeze blowing in. That is how we have Jews, we have Hindus, Muslims, all worship Christ. Because he was the son of God and this fact is tangible. Everything in Sahaja Yoga is tangible. They have all the proofs. So when you know the absolute truth, how can there be world fights? How can there be wars? Because everybody knows the truth, they are not sitting in the darkness. Thus we realize very clearly that we are now understanding the essence of every religion. Every religion has said that you are to be born again, that you have to be from the Spirit. Every religion has said that. Once you know that, you realize that all these people wanted us to be the Spirit, to understand the unity of all the religions. So we believe in an universal religion which believes in all religions and respects all religions. It respects all the incarnations, all the prophets, all the seers and all the real saints. These saints are evolved souls, they are not just certified by someone. And they have powers to raise your community. They have powers to clone. They have the full knowledge of the subtle system and everything. The nature of the Spirit is so great that it cannot be described in this short time. But you feel extremely energetic. Now I am about seventy years of age and tonight, this morning I came from Barcelona and this night I am going to a far off place. South America I am going now and I am amazed that Spanish and South America are very sensitive to reality. They don't take to artificial reality. They don't believe in people who are Jesus. And I am sure that this time at least, new people are going to get your realization and then you are going to settle down with it. Within one month's time you will become masters and then you start enjoying it, yourself and others. You don't have to pay for anything. But you have to respect your Self Realization and you must make this correction fully established. And if it happens, you will be surprised to know that you will be all the time in the ocean of joy, swelling and frolicking. It's a fact that you become very great and extremely creative. It's not time for me to tell you all about it. But I assure you that you all can get your Realization, the Unite of Fear. I know you have questions in your head because you see the Western mind thinks too much. Also this is a new knowledge to you. But I will say, if you have any questions you can write them down and you can give it to Jose and I'll try to answer them to him. For the last twenty two years I have been answering such questions. I am quite an expert. But it is just a mental feat. It should not be mental, it is beyond mental. So first thing happens to you that you become thoughtlessly aware. You are not in the future or the past but you are in the center, in the present. Then you grow in your spiritual. So first you get your thoughtless awareness. I mean if you want you can think also but if you don't want you just become peaceful and there is thoughtless awareness. So your awareness is there, you are aware, you don't think, you are aware but your thought is. And in the second state you go into doubtless awareness. Because it is tangible, you can get proof of whatever is said to you. It is not blind faith. So then you become doubtless. Then you become very powerful, the power of love. So far we have not used the power of love only in the power of action. But power of love is the most strong, most beautiful thing. It constructs human beings into beautiful flowers like blossoms. Life becomes full of blessings. So I have to tell you that for this realization you take only ten minutes. Not more than ten minutes. But those who do not want to have realization, I cannot force them. You all can get your realization but you have to be absolutely free to accept it. You cannot be compelled on you or forced on you, cannot be. So those who do not want to have their self-realization should please be the one. All of you will get realization. So I assure you that you all can get your self-realization. But you must have full faith in yourself. You should not doubt yourself. There are three conditions which you are fulfilling. You are very simple. The first condition is that you have to have full faith in yourself that you will get your realization. You should doubt yourself. It follows the second condition. The second condition is that you should not condemn yourself, you should not feel guilty at this moment. Because there is this All-Pervading Power which is the ocean of forgiveness. And it is so powerful that it can resolve all the mistakes you have committed. So it is to be understood that if you are going to get your realization then you should not feel guilty at all at this moment. Because when you feel guilty you don't know that you can't on the left hand side of this center, on the left hand side here you can't. And by that you develop diseases like angina. You develop spondylitis and also you develop very lethargic organs on the left side. So to feel guilty is a myth. If you have committed any mistake then you have to just say that, all right I have committed this mistake, face it. But don't put it here. I assure you that whatever mistakes you have committed will be completely fulfilled. But have faith in yourself and respect for yourself because you are a human being. Human beings are at the epitome of their evolution. And they are the ones who are going to get realization. So it is very important to understand that you all can get your realization but don't feel guilty. People will just frighten you saying you are sinners and all that but there is nothing to be frightened about. Now the third condition is even easier. In the third condition you have to forgive everyone. In the second one you have to forgive yourself first. And in the third one you have to forgive everyone. Whether you forgive or don't forgive, logically what will you do? Nothing. But you play into wrong hands when you don't forgive. Those who have troubled you or tortured you are happy people. But you are playing into their hands and torturing yourself. More over does the center adopt a child mark. It is like this, constricted absolutely. And if you do not forgive, it will never open out. If you forgive, then it opens like this nicely. So first you have tortured yourself and now if you do not forgive, you miss your self-realization which is the greatest thing that you have to have. And you should not miss it. So don't even think about those people who you have to forgive because they are ready. Just in general you have to say, I forgive all of them. It's a very easy thing to do if you understand how important it is. Yesterday in Barcelona I found people were not forgiving and I had to work very hard on that. But today I have detached the plane so I won't be able to work it out. So please you, please listen to me and forgive. I am happy you are in a happy world. In short you should be pleasantly placed towards yourself. Why are you all thinking? Because you are not giving up. You are going to enter into the kingdom of God and you should do very happily. All right. So now I get the question, take out your shoes if you have no objection because this Mother Earth helps us a lot. All of you should be seated. There is room here. I told you, you have to be comfortable. Now please put both your feet apart from each other because you can do all the three powers. That Jose is told in that left side and right side there are two powers. Left is the power of design and the right is the power of action. So left is the power of mundane desire but the Kundalini is the power of pure desire. So you have to have just pure desire in the heart that you have to have your realization. But this time I would like to request all of you. I have been to Spain many a times. I have lived crowds also. They get realization and just get lost. I am sorry to say because it is like the parable of Christ that some fell, some seeds fell on the rocks and some on the marshy land and got lost. So please try to understand that it is extremely important for you to become a master of this. These are most important times, the new age that carries me. That is what it is. And if you do not become masters, where will you be? And will you be here responsible? Wherever you are digging a well, you find every water you want digging there. You don't want digging here, digging there, digging there. I am not for guru shopping. I am not market-winning. It is whatever is yours, yours I am giving you. Now you have to put both your hands like this on your lap, very comfortably. Now we will be using our left hand like this symbolizing that you want to have your realization, your desire. And we will be using our right hand towards Me. And we will be using the right hand for nourishing our centers. So first we put our right hand on our heart. Because the Spirit resides in the heart. You don't have to do it again. It's once for all. Just put your right hand on your heart. Now here you have to say, you have to know that the Spirit, if it is awakened, you become your own masters, your own guide. So you put your right hand on the left hand side of your abdomen, even on the left hand side only, which is the center of your mastery. This is created by the great prophets. By awakening of this center, not only that you become master, but you become absolutely righteous, virtuous, automatically. And then you enjoy your own virtues and virtues of others, not boring at all. Then you put your left right hand into the low portion of your abdomen. This is the center of Divine knowledge, of the pure Divine knowledge. I cannot force it on you. Again I respect your freedom. So you will have to ask later on. I will tell you what is to be said. Now raise your hand again on the left hand side of your abdomen, on the upper portion. Now you raise your right hand again on the corner. Now raise your right hand now in the corner of your neck and your shoulder, where you see here, and put your head to your right. This is the center I told you about, when you feel guilty goes out of order. Now raise your right hand on top of your forehead across and put down your head as far as possible. This is the center for forgiving everyone in general, without thinking about them. Now take back your right hand on the back side of your head and push back your head. Now this is the center where without feeling guilty, without committing your mistakes, just for your satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness from this All-Pervading Power. Just for your satisfaction. Now the last center which is important. Stretch your hand. Stretch your palm and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone in. It was the soft bone in your childhood. Now push back your fingers as far as possible so there's a good pressure on your scalp. This is important. Now put down your head and now you have to move your scalp seven times clockwise. Please. This time. Now move it. This time. Seven times. That's all we have to do but now we have to close our eyes. You can take out your glasses and till I tell you please don't open your eyes. Now all of you should close your eyes. Now remember to put your feet apart from each other. Put the left hand towards Me and right hand on the heart. And now please close your eyes. Put your right hand on your heart and here you have to ask a phonetic question about your scalp. Let me give the complete instructions. So now you have to ask a question in your heart three times. You can call me Mother or you can call Me Shri Mataji. Mother, am I the spirit? Ask this question three times. Do you trust Jesus? Or is this clearly the standing and watching? Now if you are the spirit you become your own guide, your own master. So please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Press it. And here you ask another phonetic question about yourself. Mother, am I my own master? I have already told you that I cannot force pure knowledge of the Divine on you. You have to ask for it. So now you have to take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Press it hard. And here you have to say or ask, Mother please give me pure knowledge. You have to say it six times because this center has got six petals. Mother, please give me pure knowledge. Six times you have to say it. As soon as you ask for pure knowledge the kundalini starts rising upward. So we have to open the upper centers with our self-confidence. So now you have to raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen and you have to say with full confidence ten times, Mother I am my own master. You have to open the upper centers. It's self-confidence. You can ask a question, Mother, you are my own master. I have already told you that the fundamental truth about you is that you are not this body, this mind. This condition is this ego, emotions but you are the pure Spirit. Now you have to raise your right hand in the, on top of your heart and you have to say with full confidence ten times, Mother I am the pure Spirit. Mother, it's your soul that's built into it. This All-Pervading Power is the ocean of knowledge, of compassion and bliss. But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness. So whatever mistakes you might have committed this power of forgiveness can dissolve everything. So now raise your right hand on to the left hand side of your corner of the neck and the shoulder and here you turn your head to your right. You have to say sixteen times with full confidence, Mother I am not little. Please turn your head to your right sixteen times. Now I have already told you whether you forgive or you don't. If you don't forgive you don't do it but you play it wrong hand. And at this moment if you don't forgive this Agnya center won't open and the Kundalini won't come up. So you miss the opportunity, such a great opportunity of Self Realization at this moment. So raise your right hand on to your forehead and now bend your head fully downward and here you have to say with full confidence not how many times but from your heart Mother I forgive everyone in general. Now you are going to say something. Mother I forgive everyone in general. You are going to say something. You are going to say something. Mother I forgive everyone in general. So say it from your heart. Now without feeling it, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction you have to ask forgiveness from the Divine power. So you take your right hand on the back side of your head and push back your head as far as possible. Here you have to say with full confidence not how many times but from your heart Oh Divine power please forgive me if I have done anything wrong knowingly or unknowingly. Now you have to ask for your satisfaction by putting your hand on the back side of the head and by holding the head up, you feel the power of your heart. You have to ask for your satisfaction by holding the Divine power if you have done anything wrong for a long time. Say it from your heart. Not how many times. Now the last center which is very important, you have to stretch your palm fully and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area and put down your head. Here again I cannot cross over your freedom. So you have to ask for your Self-realization. So move your scalp seven times slowly saying Mother please give me my Self-realization. Please bend your heads, bend your heads. Please bend your heads, bend your heads and press it hard and move it seven times. Ask seven times Mother give me Self-realization. You spread your fingers. Now please take down your hands. Please open your eyes and put both the hands to the ceiling as you can. Now you have to ask for your satisfaction by holding the head up. Now you have to ask for your satisfaction by holding the head up. Now put both the hands to the ceiling as you can. Now you watch Me without thinking. You can do it. Now put the right hand like this and bend your head and see for yourself if there's a cool or warm or a hot breeze line, breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area, the left hand. Don't put your hand on your head away from it. How do you say? If it is hot that means you are not forgiven. Please forgive. If it is hot that means you are not forgiven. Please forgive. Some people get it close, some people get it forward. Now please take down your left hand like this. Left hand. And now with the right hand you just bend your head and see. Now like this, like this. Not like that. Like this. Left hand. See now. See. Open your eyes and see. Now. Now. Put now right hand again once more. Now see for yourself. Now raise both your hands and push back your head. Here you have to ask one of these three questions. One. Mother, this is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. Second one is Mother, is this the All-Prenaic Power of Divine Love? The third one, Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya? Ask anyone of these questions. Three times. Now take down your eyes please. You feel very relaxed. Now all those who have felt cool, warm or hot breeze on their fingertips or in their hands or out of the fontanel bone area, please raise both your eyes. Those who have felt, please raise both your eyes. So this is Margaret, a great artist, may God bless you. So many of you have been, got your germination, but now you have to look after yourself. You feel very relaxed now. But you have to come, not follow on and later on to a center so that within a month's time you become experts. You can go to the road. Now this is very important. Only you have to work it out for one month and you can master it. I'm sorry I'm a kid for South America, so I beg of you today that I had such a short time. More only got lost on the way. So I hope you will all become like great trees of fragrance of God. And one light which is enlightened can enlighten another. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. You can have another one of them, please. Thank you very much. Thank you.

in the Varanasi University and has been the top grade artist of the All India Radio and Television, and has had, I don't know how many concerts to her credit. And accompanying her on the tabla is a familiar face, Mr. Iyer. I will not now stand between you and the devotion of music. So may I present to you Dr. Rajam Jaishimath. I'm sorry. Behind the great artist is the pillar of strength, Mr. Rajam, who incidentally is also a chartered accountant like me and is also a great devotee of music, I'm sure. Jaishimath. Jaishimath. Jaishimath. Jaishimath. Jaishimath. Jaishimath. Jaishimath. Jaishimath. Jaishimath. Jaishimath. Jaishimath. Jaishimath. Mr. Mathaji wants country leaders to come on the stage. Country leaders to be on the stage. Mr. Mathaji. Mr. Mathaji. Mr. Mathaji. Mr. Mathaji. Mrs. Adam is known to Me, I don't know from how many years, and she is very talented lady and her relations also I have met, they are all very talented and they have dedicated their lives for the worship of Saraswati. She is from South but she has picked up North Indian music so well. It's very amazing how she renders it and she has been playing with Shri Shri Shri Shri Shri Kapur Mukhanach. So in her style with more what you call as Gayatri, means more like a singing song, extremely relaxed and beautiful having the music and you all will be surprised how this western instrument which is a violin we have adapted to our style by sitting down, you see we don't stand up like wrong wheeling, no. It's a very relaxed style and how see how it has been worked out. So this is a melody, it's not the kind of music you have where if you people play something and then play it yourself and but it's a continuous beautiful expression of a melody. So people from Kabela of course know her very well and they overjoyed that she is here. But Indians I think have not seen her many and she is very, very happy to go. She was very, very successful and we had a very violent night that day. It was raining and Vishnu Maya was just feathering us. Everything happened and then she sat down and then the police came to help us and they saw us, we were quite surprised. So it was a beautiful background I should say the atmosphere and after that she was so relaxed and Vishnu. Today she has decided to play to you the music. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Uh oh. Uh oh. Uh oh. Uh oh. Uh oh. Uh oh. Uh oh. Uh oh. Uh oh. Uh oh. Uh oh. Uh oh. Uh oh. Uh after this very, very beautiful concert I find it very difficult to express the beauty that we have enjoyed and the delicacy, all the waves of different hues and colors. It's something I feel like after the realization she has jumped into another realm. Definitely. As if she was pulling every string of My heart all the time. With such dignity and balance and all of you absolutely lost in the waves of that beautiful rapport you had. Our music I know I have told you hundred times comes from the Spirit and as you have now felt your Spirit you can appreciate the joy and when the Spirit manifests its light on these beautiful tunes and melodies then it gets a very special type of a vision for all of you and I'm happy you enjoyed Her thoroughly. She's got a realization and you are all Sahaja Yogis so naturally there was great relationship also. Apart from that I have discovered one thing more today that South Indians when they take to music it's not a profession it's a worship. The purity of rendering the art is so evident not in Her but also with Mr. Balakrishna. Both of them absolutely the purity of it. There's no mixture, there's no cheapness, there's no publicity or sort of a you can say modulated things. It's just pure art, it is the greatest purity and this is something I discovered today. We have to learn from South Indians this point very important that they render. I've seen not here but even in Madras whether they're dancing, they are playing violin or they are playing their mudangam or anything it is for them a worship. Because of that the purity is mentioned. There's no show off, nothing so so deep. And today these two artists who are from South have learnt all North Indian music. The rendering is so pure so pure I mean. I was just thinking of some great artists whom I have heard because I must be the oldest woman here. And those who have been really very much in My view the highest or we can call the epitome of our classical North Indian music have been expressed through them today differently. No show off, nothing it's so beautiful. And this is what we have to learn that art is a worship, it's not a profession. Many people say that those who are pujaris or Saraswati are always in trouble as far as the Lakshmi is concerned. So that's your duty to look after their Lakshmi side. But their duty is to be purely devoted, dedicated to the art as a worship and as audience or you can say as people who are enjoying that music must look after their financial side, their Lakshmi side and also always respect, respect the artist. Artist is to be respected because he is worshipping the goddess Saraswati. I can't understand how people can be disrespectful. And in our country specially I've seen now there's such a big trend towards cheap type of music that they just make fun of art. As Sahaja Yogis you have to really understand that this is the music of the Spirit. Whether it is North or South Indian, I enjoy the same way whether it is South Indian or North Indian music, makes no difference to Me. Both are absolutely supreme in their own style and feeling. I don't know what to say about Mrs. Rajan. I met her because of her mother-in-law actually and then she has developed so much. But today she was very much different I felt, very much closer to Me and closer to all of you. May God bless you, Sahaja Yogis. I hope in our work time to listen to your problem. If you are in Bombay, if it is easier for us to get you where She is in Benares, doesn't matter. We have very small little thing for her. Something for you in the Maharashtra South. You always wear South Indian silence but I hope you'll enjoy this one also. I hope you have height if you fit, I mean. May God bless you, Sahaja Yogis. May God bless you, Sahaja Yogis. May God bless you, Sahaja Yogis. May God bless you, Sahaja Yogis.

Your best friend will be great. Don't worry, your best friend will be great. Okay. Come on. Good man. She is good. Okay. Guys. So, there you go. For most of us, you can wear this. Shh. Okay.

Please don't try to create problems for Me. All My blessings to you. Please move a little bit, very slowly. All of you should move, very slowly. With your right hand please. Number one. Number two. Please, Mr. Malcolm's father, please. Where is the father of Mr. Malcolm? Mr. Malcolm from UK. Hello. Please. The girl has to accept her future husband. It's according to our Sahaj culture. First the girl has to accept. No girl can be forced to marry someone. So the first the girl has to accept and then the boy has to agree. This is first being decided. Now it's all right you can go ahead with the marriage. We call it as Jaya Mal. It's first stage.

So in the first stage, both the brides and the bridegrooms have to accept the Vishwanirmal Dharma. So this acceptance pledge will be read here on behalf of both the brides and the bridegrooms. Then the next stage comes, this is Kanyadana. For the Kanyadana, the bride's mother will drop water in the brides. The meaning of Kanyadana means the father and mother of the girl have to give consent and to give the girl's hand into the hands of the boy with certain promises. Now first you have to accept that you belong to the universal religion of Sahaja. Means Vishwanirmal Dharma. The innate religion within you. That you have to accept otherwise we cannot marry you.

All brides and bridegrooms should take the following pledge. We all accept the Dharma of Sahaja Yoga. That is Vishwanirmal Dharma. We do not accept any other religion. We do not accept the bindings of any other religion except Vishwanirmal Dharma. I renounce all the Dharma's and surrender to Shri Adi Shakti alone. I accept the Vishwanirmal Dharma for achieving the God Realization. The way of life in Vishwanirmal Dharma is Satyam Acharyaata. That is the truth should be followed. Priyam Acharyaata. That which is blissful should be followed. Hitham Acharyaata. That which would promote Hitham, that is well being, should be followed. Benevolence. Which will promote benevolence. Benevolence should be followed. The way of life in Vishwanirmal Dharma is Satyam Acharyaata. The truth should be followed. Priyam Acharyaata. That which is blissful and compassionate should be followed. Hitham Acharyaata. That which would promote Hitham, the benevolence, should be followed.

Now the next stage is the Kanyadana. That is giving away the daughter to her husband. Now in this process, while the, to start with, we will be reading here what bride's father is supposed to be telling to the bridegroom. Thereafter, we will also read out here the acceptance of the bridegroom. That is the bridegroom will accept what is, accept to comply with what is being told to him by the bride's father. Thereafter, we will read the mantra in Sanskrit. At that time, we will have to do the actual Kanyadana. In the Kanyadana, the father of the bride will hold his hand over the hands of the bride. The bride's father has to hold his hand on top of the right hand of the bride, and the mother of the bride has to pour water on top of the bride's father's hand, symbolic that now we have washed off our hands of our daughter. Now, did you follow that? Will you please, now the bride's parents, the father and mother, come forward. Senior Sahaja Yogi should stand in between and guide them. Only the bride's father and mother should come forward. Nowriya chahat. Only the bride's father and mother have to come in the play. Will you please hold the hand, the father of the bride, hold the hand on top of the bride's hand and the mother has to pour the water. When we say, not just now. Others should not do anything. It's only bride's father and mother. Now let's have it.

Now, bride's father says thus to the bridegroom, my daughter is a Sahaj Yogini and she has accepted the Vishwaniramala Dharma. Also I and her mother are followers of Vishwaniramala Dharma. Considering that you are the best Sahaj Yogi, I offer my daughter to you in the auspicious and divine presence of Shri Adi Shakti. So keeping fully in mind the importance of this great function, please give complete respect to it. The bridegroom says, of course I will comply with it. Imaam kanyam susnaat am, yatha shakta lankurtam, patnit vena tubbyam aam sampradade. Bride's father has to say this. Now the bridegroom has to say that I am accepting the bride. Aum swasti. Say now, Aum swasti. Bridegroom haa. Just follow me. Means accept. Now the next stage is you will find in that plate two colored threads. The husband has to tie this one. Bridegroom should tie the thread with the dharbariya daswada on the left hand of the bride. First of all the bridegroom has to tie. In the right hand. Bridegroom. Bride has to tie this on to the right hand of the boy. There is a turmeric piece. Please take it up and let the boy tie it into the left hand of the bride. And the bride has to tie onto the right hand of the bridegroom. I hope it is understood now.

Now, both say the following. It is with the blessings of Sri Adi Shakti that I accept the auspicious bond of this marriage and pray, Sahaja Yoga Vardhatam. May the Sahaja Yoga grow. Atma Sakshatkar Vardhatam. May the Self-realization grow. Pusti Tusti Vardhatam. May the satisfaction grow. May we always have, by blessings of Adi Shakti, the sensitivity of Chaitanya, the life without ego, the joy of Sahaja ethics, the energy and enthusiasm to do the Sahaja Yoga work. Both the bride and the bridegroom have to say this in Sanskrit, repeat it when he says it. Alright, listen to it. Careful, it's not very difficult Sanskrit for you. Just follow me.

Now you have to tie the sign of marriage in the neck of the bride. The bridegroom has to do that. You just garland them, you need not tie up, just put them. Good. Please do it. Now the bridegroom should say, I am tying the Mangal Sutra, that is the thread of auspiciousness, as that which is the form of chaitanya, that which is pure, chaste and auspicious, that which is verily the thread of the chaitanya and auspiciousness and hence it is called the Mangal Sutra. Now you say it in Sanskrit, the bridegroom. So the bridegroom should repeat. In English, please follow Me saying, I am tying the Mangal Sutra, that is the thread of auspiciousness, as that which is the form of chaitanya, that which is pure, chaste and auspicious, that which is verily the thread of chaitanya and auspiciousness and hence it is called the Mangal Sutra.

Now the last is, well it's not absolutely last but in between a little bit, that you have to make the fire element as the witness, called as Lajahom. The brother of the bride has to come forward. Even the uncle will do. Mama is the mother's brother will do also. The best one of the bridegroom should come forward. You have to ignite the fire while I am reading this. This is a prayer to Sri Ganesha. Then you start igniting the fire. Om gananaam tvam ganapatim bhavaamahy kavim kavinaam bhupasthiravastamam jeshtarajam brahmanam brahmanaspata ana shindvam nathibi jala ye na jala ye om bhakrathun damahakaya surya kotisam apramah nirvignam kurume teva sarva karyeshu sarvada.

Now you can see the rice krispies. The best one has to put it in the hand of the boy. Alright. First of all the brother has to put it, a brother or a best man has to put it in the hand of the bridegroom. Right hand. Now you have to put it, the bridegroom has to put this into the fire. It's suggestive to the brother that I will look after the chastity and the purity of your sister. I'll protect her from any attack on her chastity or purity. So now the boy puts a little bit of that rice krispies into the hands of the boy on the bridegroom. I mean the best one. Now when you have put it then you put it in the fire. The mantras will be said once. When you are putting it in the fire after that the bridegroom has to put some ghee on top of that with the spoon. While doing all these the bride has to touch the right hand of the bridegroom near his elbow. Bride has to touch with the right hand at the elbow of the bridegroom. When I say saha, please put it in the fire. While the sacred fire is witnessed, we invoke our own kundalini's and pray that all our faults, negativity and conditioning be burned into the ashes in the light of the kundalini. Once more. While the sacred fire is witnessed, we promise that we shall not support or take the side of those people who are not following the Sahaj Dharma. We also promise that we shall pay great regards to all sahaj yogis as they would be befitting to saints and sadhus and extend all hospitality to them. Fifth time. This is the last and the fifth time again please. The brother has to do it. While the sacred fire is witnessed, we resolve to lead the life with all humility within the mariada of limits of sahaja yoga. Like the fire which limits itself inside the firewood because the kundalini is the cool power of the divine Agni within us.

Now you have to walk seven steps with your bride. First you have to follow your wife. Three steps will be followed with your wife and then the four steps by the husband. There are seven mounds of rice. If you see, be careful where you go round the fire with your saris and clothes. Left to right. Now listen to Me. You have to go round the fire. The girl will lead first. First round when you take a vow and when you come back the girl will move with her right nabi. That is your right big toe. You just disturb that, remove that. That means one is over. It will be for three times for the bride and then four times for the man when the man will lead the bride. Now let's do. First time let's go round. All others should move out. Be careful with their saris. Move from left to right like the clockwise. Now go forward.

For the first round the bridegroom says to the bride, I remember Sri Adi Shakti Mataji in my heart and tell you that you must keep the chastity that would be necessary for good mooladhara. Our well being and auspiciousness lies in completely accepting and keeping full respect of innocence and forsaking cunningness. Alright. Now come along.

Second round. These are all the seven chakras we are talking about. Be careful. I remember Sri Adi Shakti Mataji in my heart. Now remove the second mound of rice by the girl with the big toe. And tell you that the divine aesthetics of married life should be seen in our daily life. Our home should be aesthetically decorated like planets and stars that are revolving within the limits of their orbits at specific distances. We should do all our work within and strictly abiding by the dharma. I shall extend all hospitality to Sahaja Yogis and fully associate with you in performing the duties towards dharma. May we both achieve the blessings of enjoying the joy of collectivity.

Now the third round. Slowly, slowly. I remember Sri Adi Shakti Mataji in my heart and tell you that I will hand over all the money that I earn to you fully realizing that it has come to me as the reward of your punya. You should spend that money carefully and only after consulting me. Keeping in mind that all the wealth belongs to God, we should spend our wealth whatever possible with the feeling that we are receiving God's blessings. There should be no hankering of material objects and becoming completely detached. We should nourish our mahakali principle. Mahalakshmi principle. Now the boy comes forward, the bridegroom comes forward and the bride follows. I hope you are listening to what we are saying on your behalf.

Fourth round now. Slowly, slowly. I remember Sri Adi Shakti Mataji in my heart and tell you that I will never hurt your feelings and shall forget all the mistakes made by both of us in our past lives. My love for you would be limitless and so should be yours. Please do not suppress your feelings and never hesitate to tell me if for some reasons your mind is at anguish or someone troubles you. I shall always stand by you, protect you and shall never listen to any false complaints against you. Now rub it off. This is the fourth one the boy has to rub it off.

Now fifth one again the boy in the bridegroom is to be in front and the bride has to follow him. Now the bride tells to the bridegroom, I remember Sri Adi Shakti Mataji in my heart and tell you that I shall bring the divine sweetness in your life. I shall cook delicious food that can be enjoyed by you. We should eat only the food cooked by Sahaja Yogis. Please do not force me to meet or be in the company of those who are not good Sahaja Yogis. We should never use between ourselves, abyshew or bad language and should never shout at each other. You should quietly listen to me and I shall also quietly listen to you.

Now the sixth round. I remember Sri Adi Shakti Mataji in my heart and tell you that we both should regularly meditate and teach our children and also our friends how to meditate. Our life should be that of penance but we should not complain or unnecessarily tell others about it and should be happy in all circumstances. Your eyes should be pure and free from lust for women and without greed for anything.

Now the seventh round. I remember Sri Adi Shakti Mataji in my heart and tell you that we should truly understand that Her Holiness Sri Mataji Nirmala Devi has conferred her great blessings on us and so we should completely surrender and dedicate our hearts to her. This dedication should be through complete integration of body, mind and intellect. We should be aware how tremendous and unprecedented work is with the self-realization and rest anything in our life is unimportant and of no consequence. It is my condition that we should day and night unceasingly enjoy Her ever flowing grace, devote and dedicate ourselves to Her, regularly offer the puja to Her photo with all the protocols and be extremely humble in Her presence. Please correct me if you find me failing in this. Now both of you have to say together this.

Now bride and bridegroom should say together, I shall open the path of moksha which I have got with the blessings and the grace of Her Holiness Sri Mataji also to others and shall achieve in the company of such great and realized persons the well-being of whole universe. This is in Sanskrit you have to say.

Now the last you please be seated. Now this is the completion of havana. You have to put, the bridegroom has to put the ghee on the fire and the bride has to touch the hand of the bridegroom with the right hand. There are three mantras that will be said and it is to be put three times. I hope you have understood it. All right. Now with the first mantra Om Aganaye Swaha. Put on, not the second time. Third time. Three times, that's all. That's enough. Om Tat Sat. Put it again. Yes, three times Om Tat Sat. Now the last one. Om Purnamada Purnamidam Purnat Purnamolachat Purnasya Purnamada Purnameva Vasishchate. This is four times. Now the last. Om Shanti Om Shanti Om Shanti.

Hello. The copper vessels which have been given to you for haven are yours. They belong to you. Now you can take them with you. All the copper vessels and also the Ganesha should be taken by the bride and bridegroom to their places. Moreover the presents will be given to you. Be seated. Lightly. These Southwestern leaders come along. Hello. Please come. All the Western leaders immediately. Come along. One each. Please give one each. One each to one couple. And both the bride and bridegroom should take it. Step to climb up. All of you go away from the bride and the bridegroom just now for one minute. I'm everything gets fixed. All the women are there. Those who haven't got the present please inform this side. If there is a surplus present please bring this side. Hello. If there is a surplus present bring it here. Anybody who has surplus present come here. Will all the other people relations keep away for five minutes? Hello please be seated. Right down each side. Please. Sandeep. What is it with me? Hey. You all have to drink together.

The mechanical thing. Meant to say what I enjoy. You have to say the couplet. She said the couplet. Are they not coming here? So what you have to do is to make one morsel. First the bridegroom. All right. Who is ready with the couplet? Why not I know? You are ready? Great. I must say. Come along. No, you sit there only. Right way. It will take some more time like that. But if you do it fast, one after another, then you can have your food faster. You have to make a couplet before you make a man of your own food. So make a little bit of a cut. And then when you are ready, you have to use the microphone. So we have one ready here. OK. Roger. By the grace of Shri Mataji I have become a Sahaja Yogi with Shravani. I have become the Grosti Deva. Italian if you like. Good. Thank you Shravanicha for this big present and for this joy that you put your heart and every right. Thank you.

My name is Edgar and the name of my bride is Santosh. I don't know Marathi and Hindi yet but I will try something in English. Santosh, if this garland I offer my life to adorn your beauty and to tell the truth and to please Shri Mataji, Santosh Ji, I say that I love you very much. Yeshe Mataji, thank you for this present. My wife is a bride and now you have taken names. Take a morsel and put it in the mouth of the lady. Then the girl has to do it, come along. The poetry is, you can take care of my vishuddhi because you can provide me the ghee and the horn like a bee. Come along, start it. Just give her. The girls can give a big one. She is frightened. She will come in. Thank you.

We are Russell and Shamila. Shamila Yogini from Roma, she make me feel at home. By cooking me lots of pasta, she make me ascend much faster. Can you say very quick I must say. Who else coming forward? What about Shamila? My name is Shamila. Thank you, Shri Mataji, for filling my heart of joy. What about your husband's name? His name? Oh, thank you. What is your name? My name is Narasimha. You can start now. The bride must first take a very big morsel, this size and stuff it into the bridegroom’s mouth so he stops talking thereafter. And the bridegroom may try to reciprocate, but I don't know whether he'll succeed. First the bride will pick up a big laddu or something and stuff it into the mouth of the bridegroom. Go on.

Namaste Shri Mataji. My wife's name is Aarti. And by Your grace, may our world life be a permanent Aarti to Your glory. Shri Mataji, You have given me Subhash and I'll give my life to You. Shri Mataji, my wife's name is Manju. If it doesn't rhyme, it will be all. Shri Mataji, three bottles and one glass. Jhumpa is first class. Jai Shri Mataji. My name is Sunita. I meet a wonderful girl called Sunita. No one else could be sweeter. Jai Shri Mataji. Now, the gifts of this local girl who has been born in Gnanpant Chai are granted me Shri Mataji. We have to have a program offered by this village. There is a special one done when the marriage is over. What does Naman means? Jai Shri Mataji. My name is Christian and the name of my wife is Kiran. The poetry is like this. Now she has given me a daily sunrise. Mr. Bhakas Patil is here. I'm not married. Hashanah will give you the first one.

Can you dance like them? With such light feet? She is Ganesha's Kripa. I was really enamored the way they were doing this dance because they have no way of learning this art or anything but the rhythm with which they were working out. It's not possible. I wish those who want to dance in Sahaja Yoga should learn some steps from them. Would be a better idea. So rhythmic. And also the drama you couldn't understand I have also understood little bit. But what it showed was the complete faith in God, complete faith in Shri Ganesha, complete faith in Shri Krishna. And with another style of music we call it as Gavana means the gopis who used to worship Shri Krishna and how they would dance and how they would get dissolved or should say get completely engrossed in Islam. In their own way, I mean in a village way, there's a poetry is there, there's music, they are dancing. I mean there is no way of penetrating these far off places where one could see such thing but what I said look at them how they are absolutely innocent people. And their rhythm of their feet, all of them is very much matching with the sea, you know the sea goes on like that. That's how they were rhythmically moving. And I was surprised behind them all the village people who are in shirt, pants, anything whatever is there also singing with them. Such a unique and such an understanding.

I wish I could sit more but I have some work to be done. That's why I have to leave but I hope you will enjoy this and now see how they are. Try if you can lift your legs that fast. We have only Hamid but Hamid also can't do this. So beautiful. So this is something one has to see in a sense how people can work it out. I know you must be expecting some sort of another music but there is lot in this and the way the rhythm is played and the way it is sung and the way these boys, they are after all boys but the way they are doing their footsteps are really remarkable. So now I leave it to you with all this entertainment and I hope your marriages will be very successful and lots of saints want to be born to you and will have really a great family system of a new generation. I bless you all with my heart. And I wish you to have complete faith in yourself and by no means you should fall from your state.

Asere! Please be seated. It was really such a unique day and such a performance. Words really are not sufficient to describe our joy but as you were singing today about Anand Vihari I saw all of you becoming Anand Viharis, absolutely. Now we have before us such a great artist. His name is, you know, Ustad Amzad Ali Khansad. But have you seen the word Ali there? Perhaps you do not know that we worship Ali and Fatimabi in a puja. There's a regular puja for them because to us they are Brahma Deva itself and that's why you'll find among these Shia people who have got such a talent of expression. In the Koran I'm sorry to say that Mohammed Sahib was tortured so much and also later on as you know Hassan and Hussein were killed in Karbala. They had no time to talk about the universal nature but such a great book is this Koran. We have written now some sort of a commentary on that and it's obvious that he was the incarnation of the Primordial Master. Though he was so humble, he was so much worried that he should not be called as Divine because people will again start doing all kinds of ritualism. But now you can see, specially in on Tabla, left side of a Musalman is always very strong, Mani U Thathiri. This is the blessing of that great incarnation of Ali. Brahma Deva incarnate only twice. One was Ali who was not understood even by the followers Mohammed Sahib. It's always so. But we know who he is and we worship him. And by taking his name we have cured many diabetic patients. But before that we have to be connected with that Divine power. Now I see two great saints sitting next to Amzad Ali Sahib. They are really saints. Born realized you can see that. Otherwise at this young age they cannot be so deft. They cannot be. Such understanding, rapport and deftness from last life might be, they might have been with Tanse or someone, I don't know, but really they are prodigies. And such prodigies are now born to great artists is also the blessing of the Divine I think. You choose your parents no doubt. But they should be born to such great artists. Itself he shows their own choice. And they are saints. I am happy they have come to Maharashtra because you know Marashtrians are absolutely drowned into music. We had saints and saints and musicians saints, all kinds of things. But we had no saints yet who were playing sarod. So such beautiful things you see nowadays happening in this world that these great people are taking birth in the families of great artists because they know the value of this art, of this great classical music art. You also now realize, I know because now you are realized souls and you understand it and you don't like cheap type music. But see their dignity, their style and everything. Of course I always felt Amzad Ali was like my son, always. He is Khansab, he is a big man I know. But I always felt that kind of a feeling for him because he has that humility. With all that art, with all that creativity he is so humble. He is not at all conscious of his own achievements, at all. I give really a great credit to him and to his two children also. You know how difficult it is for Me to be your mother and your guru. It is very difficult situation. In the same way a father being your guru is very difficult, specially for such a music which requires complete tapashchariya, complete dedication and complete respect of your guru. When he is your father it's very difficult. I don't know how things are being managed by these children and how they have imbibed these things and such respect for their father. Because they see what art he has. I feel a great vision is before Me of this great music. And through music you have seen the chaitanya, the vibrations are carried everywhere. So how far can you think of the dimensions in which all this beautiful divine music will spread? I invite also Ustad Amzad Ali Khaza to My house in Kabela. I am not such a rich person. I won't be able to really give you, support you the way I would like to support all the artists, by all the audience I always say that I have got the blessings of the Saraswati but you must look after their Lakshmi side. But I am not so well off I should say. Whatever is possible I would try to look after, specially you. With what meditative mood he was singing, just think, and he put you into meditation. Of course Yaman Raga is a very simple beautiful raga. The way he played and his children, I must say this is, I have never heard such Yaman Raga before, never heard, I must confess. I must, I am an oldest woman here, I have heard all kinds of people all My life. But never such good Yaman Raga I have heard, with such a, you see, Trigoon, because it was not Jugal Bandhi but three persons, Trigoon, Aat Pika was playing. With such poise, such dignity, such beauty. We all have enjoyed, I don't know how to thank Amzad Ali Sahib for coming himself and bringing his children to give us this joy. Also the Raghdhar Bary Kannada, which you all appreciate very much and enjoy, but I think you really got lost with him completely. It was very meditative, very, very meditative and I think all your thoughts had stopped completely. You had reached the state of Nirvichara. I also was in another world of music. Then the Kamach and the Bhajan, which was the favorite song of Mahatma Gandhi. Unfortunately Mahatma Gandhi never knew how to play any sarod, nor he knew how to sing. You know I have been with him as a child for years together, but such an interesting person he was that he could immediately make out if somebody was making any mistakes in the thala or in the sahara, surprisingly. He never knew Indian music but he had that spirit within him. Unfortunately he used to say, this is wrong and he respected music very much. Very much he respected music and in his music he, you know that very well that his bhajanavali was selected by Me quite a lot and specially the first prayers of his. He used to ask Me. Though he was a realized soul he used people who were of very mundane type, very ordinary materialistic people for the freedom of this country. I don't know, he was like some sort of a Paris putter as they say who just touches something becomes gold. He was that kind of a leader who gave us such a great idea of sarva dharma, samaan atua. But more than that is in sahaja yoga. We do not feel that all dharmas are equal but we worship all of them. All of them because they were all great people born on the tree of life, has beautiful flowers. Now you pluck them and the dead flowers you fight but they worked only for divinity and spirituality and nothing else. How could they work for anything else? But we have as human beings always try to make a mess of everything. But sahaja yoga, all the sahaja yogis worship them and this is the difference. Just feeling the same way about say Hindu Muslims and all that is different from to worship Mohammed Sahib as well as Shri Rama, partially Krishna. It's much deeper because we know they are all one. They said the same thing. They never wanted to create problems like this and in the music you find, you forget all your differences, your so-called brands, your countries, nations. Now you won't believe there are fifty-five nations sitting before you. Fifty-five nations. We have Muslims from Iran, from Algeria, from Tunisia, also there are so many of them who are now absolutely achieved the state of Sufi. We respect and worship all the great saints. In India also we had a very big movement I should say of the great saints as the Amudin Khasa. You know that the Amudin was another realized soul, Chishti where they sing in the kawalis. Never how could Mohammed Sahib say that you should not have music. How is it possible? How can it be? It's absolutely wrong, impossible. There's not much of a difference between Vaishnavajana and the Sufis, they are just the same. How could he say such a thing? And how could Christ say that you can have wine? All this is some sort of a manipulation item. Is impossible. Music is divine. Of course, cheap type music could be prohibited. But without music how are you going to worship God? How are you going to feel Him? Only at the time of meditation you can be silent. But this music that you have heard today has shown you how we were all tied in one sutra, into one beautiful feeling of oneness. So many countries are here, they have never learnt any classical music. They don't know any ragas, they don't know any talas, nothing. But the way they appreciate, you'll be surprised, is only because now they have become the Spirit. You want to say something now? Shri Mataji, it's very difficult to use words after music and it's very difficult to use words after you have spoken. We had many performances of great musicians but as soon as these great artists came in, we felt that we would be in your durba at home with someone who would play with the strings of our heart and that's what happened. We were, I don't know where Shri Mataji, certainly in joy, we were feeling the closeness. We were proud of him as if we were his children or his family. This is strange to have such a feeling for someone one has never met. We all so very much enjoyed the joyful and buoyant performance of the tala player who was sending notes of merriness and joy. And we were very impressed by the children of the great artists. Shri Mataji, on behalf of all the sahaja yogis of all the world, I would like also to thank Rajesh Shah who has provided us the opportunity to see you so pleased, Shri Mataji, because this is what we have enjoyed. In so many words, thank you very much for an exceptional evening. Thank you. There's something small from you all to them. I would like to say two words. On behalf of Mataji, when Pragya Srivastava rang us up, she wrote a formal letter and since I deal with Khan Sahab's correspondence, I just said in a normal way, I started writing since Mataji said about Lakshmi and Saraswati, I have to mention this to you. I wrote the Lakshmi part of it. And she wrote saying, Mataji is going to be here and this is your santra. I said, you asked me, that's why I wrote. I didn't say you have to do anything for us. We just need your blessings. And I humbly requested to Pragya Ji and told her, I'll be very happy, we both will be really honoured and blessed if Mataji bless the children. So this is the first time we plan to bring mainly because of you, Mataji, the children. And 14 years ago, when I was with Khan Sahab, marrying a handsome man and marrying an artist who is loved by all was a very difficult job for me to face the world. And I did not know, marrying a musician is where I ended. And I was very disturbed when I went to Mataji and I literally started crying. She took me to a room. I sat with her. She blessed me. Ever since then, I don't think I have ever looked back with her blessings. And she has cool dances there. Art and culture, I think without the love of people, the listeners and of course the blessings of people like Mataji and God, it cannot be music. So I think with all your blessings and all your blessings, Mataji, may it flourish more and more. May God bless you! May God bless you! May God bless you! May God bless you! May God bless you! May God bless you! This is what happened when Christ vibrated the water. It became, tasted like the grape juice. But they said it was wine. This is the word used in Hebrew, wine, for a grape juice. How can you make wine in one minute, instantaneously? It has to ferment, it has to rot, it has to become absolutely rotten. Otherwise it's not wine. So this is such a misunderstanding. That's why Mohammed Sahib had to say again and again. You must explain to them. So now he is in our family.

On behalf of all the Sahaja Yogis of the world, now there are fifty-five nations sitting here. On their behalf I would like to thank specially Rajesh Shah and Sukit. The Bhukun company has been always very kind and hospitable to us and we always look forward to this program. Sahaja Yogis are saying this is the best finale of the whole tour that they have and they really carry such beautiful memories of this place. I am very happy to see that so much of art is being looked after in this company because normally in a steel company to expect such art development is beyond the concept of any entrepreneur but thanks to Rajesh Shah and Sukit and all the managers and all those people they feel that their children should get into art which is a balance for all the mental activity they have to do otherwise. But the way Bhukun has shown her talent I am really amazed, I mean it's very high class, very high standard and I wish one day we could be able to call her and her troop to Bela and then we can organize their program abroad. They are leading. You see to learn Bharatanatyam in Bombay is not an easy thing because you have to have accompaniments all the time and you have to pay very heavily for a guru to come and do all the background music and everything otherwise they use just tape record and it's not so good. But here you have the guru as well as the students and I hope you get more students to learn this classical dancing of Bharatanatyam. In our school we have started teaching them Kuchipudi and the children from abroad are doing very well. Our country is full of art and you know there are so many styles of dancing. Not only that but specially this Tylana has been taken by Shivaji's brother and he started this also Bharatanatyam quite a lot. He started there near Nagapattinam to begin with. There's a big library he has made out of it. It's very surprising how Tylana has come from the word Tarana and on Tarana they play these intricate patterns of footwork. There is such a near relationship I should say with Maharashtra and with this specially in the temples they mostly in the south they use Tylana as one of the mantras for the deity to be awakened and it has given such a high place there. I myself have been to Nagapattinam and I have seen all these things and the Meenakshi temple specially this dance is performed with such devotion. It's a worship. Then I have been also to Punjab. I have studied there as you know and I also enjoyed the homely type of dancing and music as they sing because we had friends who were doctors there and who were also married when we went to their marriages. We saw all these things happening. It's very small, small things of the family life being discussed very sweetly. On a very loving manner the whole thing is describing the village family life. Once you have seen that you really are reminded of those days when we were students we used to go and listen to these songs and enjoy them very much. It's very rhythmic. So the whole country vibrates rhythm and everywhere you go it's a different style. Depends on the different cultures that they have and in the way they want to express themselves. It is a remarkable thing that in Bombay so many types of art are prospering. This Bombay which is actually placed by Mumbai, Mumbai Devi is really something to do with the art because I find all kinds of artists from all over the world come here but specially in India. So many artists who are performing all kinds of dance come here. As I said it is because of cinema but it's not so. So many schools have started and I'm sure one day this art will give some balance to this Bombay which is so industrialized and people are so busy running a ratress. This is very good for your children, for you and all of you to admire all these beautiful manifestations of Saraswati. With Lakshmi if you do not combine Saraswati you will never have balance and that's why I'm very happy that Mukul company has started this kind of a venture and all other companies will start this kind of venture. One more thing if they can start would be a good idea to form a group of people who could go in the surrounding places and find out what's the problem with them would be a good idea so some reward is established with the neighboring people who are here, what are their problems you see. And once you start establishing relationships with them it will be very helpful to your company and these people whom you are helping in your own sweet ways. Only thing is you have to just find out, make a survey, find out what's the problem is like. There are people who would like to do charitable but the problem is that when you want to do charity you don't find any institutions where you could really donate some money. For example we wanted to donate some money to some charitable institution but none of them proved to be all right and I was so shocked that in India you cannot do any charity to any place because you don't know what sort of these charitable institutions are. So if such a charitable institution is formed with the help of other companies also and keep a good honest working out administration I'm sure there will be many who would like to donate and help these people who are here and you can also do a lot for them and this will be a very unique thing that you will do because I don't think any company has tried that. Of course I know of companies who have taken a village as a kind of a thing that they look after it but nothing has been done. I've been to those villages, nothing has been done it's just they said this company has taken over, that company has taken over. So this will be a very great help to all of you because also you'll have satisfaction that you are part and parcel of this country and of the whole world. So on behalf of all the people who are here and also on behalf of all the Sahaja Yogis who are here I would like to thank the administration of Bocoon. They have been so kind, they looked after them so well, so well organized. We are really organized in the most disorganized way Sahaja Yogis are. But they don't mind because they are saints. I mean we are now going to new places, we don't know how it's going to work out but they don't mind, they can sleep anywhere, they can eat anything. But the way you organized everything is remarkable and I wish you could teach something to Sahaja Yogis who are organizing these disorganized tours. Such a pressure on them, I think it's too much of pressure on them but they don't mind also and they have done it with such joy and with such enthusiasm that it's really I don't know what to say and this is out of the blue, nobody can believe any company looking after these Sahaja Yogis in such a manner. Of course Sahaja Yoga is spreading very fast, it's spreading through many countries and all that and with the name of all these Sahaja Yogis also the name of Bocoon is spreading. It's something surprising that how Sahaja Yogis have fallen in love with your company and how they admire the way you have looked after them. If there has been any short comings on behalf of Sahaja Yogis, please forgive them. Also I didn't know today the program was starting earlier so I was resting and thinking that now they'll call me but it was just communication gap but nobody minded it, I'm so very happy. Thank you. Rajesh says that if they could sing some Indian song, they could sing some Indian song. If it is so, you give your approval first of all by clapping. We are not so equipped just now because half of them have disappeared I think because of their planes and things but whatever we have here I hope they'll be able to render some good music for you.

63344 Talk 2

So now we are at the end of our tune and you all already believing. I don't know, I'm not supposed to thank you. But I must say this time the way you took up the responsibility shows that now you can take up responsibility and need not travel all the way everywhere and you can manage it. It's a very good thing. And also for people who are on the East side, their reaction is to fix me up. If I feel all right I'll definitely come but I would like to tell you I have not been able to get the visas for your country, except for Japan. So that should be done. Somehow those visas must be managed and maybe I might be able to do this trip of the Eastern people this time and also of Japan. Now the good news is today is that the wisest man of Sahaja Yoga is Stephen.

Please come. Sit down. Please be seated. Yes. Little things. So you are a community of seekers. Good God. Shri Mataji, I think Maggie should translate for you because most of them are speaking German. Maggie, are you there? Where is she? Are you there? Yeah, I speak German. Here we go. No, yes. It's all love for me, that's all I can say. But the first thing you must have is your realization. That is very important. Now this child is a born realized. And you can feel the vibrations of the child. He's a born realized. And how will you know he's born realized or not? So once you get your realization, then you can say that who's realized, who are everything because you become the Absolute One. Now this, you've been doing some pranayama in sex. Pranayama. Pranayama moksha. Pranayama moksha. Pranayama is so important. It's very important. It's very important. Prana is so important. And prana. You do get your realization but it has to be pranava. Prana when it gets enlightened then it becomes prana. Prana when it gets enlightened. Prana is the right set power, is prana. Is created by our five elements within us. But it is the right side of me. It is the vital side for our physical and mental being. And the channel that works it out is Pingala Nadi. That is only one side. If you go too much on right side then you neglect your left side which is the side we call as Iranite. So Iranite is the emotional side. As they call it manasa. So in pranayama also they talk that you have to resolve. You have to resolve. You have to resolve. You have to resolve. They talk that you have to resolve. Prana into manasa. But the problem is before realization it is not advisable to follow any one of these patterns. Because first you should know what is our prakrti, what is our nature. Every individual has a different nature. Say for example people in the west are right side. Means they are overactive, they are futuristic, they plan a lot, they are physically and mentally equipped. So the right side which is the Surya Nadi was practiced in India long time back as you must be knowing through the Vedas also they talk about it. Now the thing is in the west if you are the right sided person then to give yourself a balance you have to be a left sided. You have to practice left sided things. And if you are left sided then you must practice right sided. So the balance is established. So in olden days you see when we were trying to seek the truth, the saints, the saints were the saints. The sages. They found that the people are mostly, mostly are left sided conditioned. So they started the system of exalting the right side. So in the Vedas you find the five elements are very important and Prajapati means the Brahma Devada creator. Of these five elements or Hiranyagar they call him when he is who got realization? But Janaka really took his lots of tests. He said, you won't give him realization. It is all described how he took his tests and then he gave him realization. We are in the test and we are standing in the center of the room. Now among you there may be some people who are right sided and maybe some people who are left sided. And you do not only belong to this life. You have had many lives of seeking. So firstly we have to see a balance to be given and then we have to see we have to see how your chakras work out, come into balance and then you get your realization. Thus you see you will come into a complete balance and then the Kundalini will rise. But it takes hardly any time to make your Kundalini rise. So tell them, I'll give you some. Now, when the Kundalini rises sheep establishes a balance, without the balance, like left and right in your spinal cord can cut out the centers. Like this, might go to the right or to the left. It cuts out the center, left and the right. Like that they make. Now when the Kundalini rises she establishes the balance, otherwise she can't rise. But afterwards you have to establish it yourself, cooperating with it. Then once you have got realization then we should see if you have to do pranayama or you have to do some vyayama or what, yamaniyama. That has to be seen after you have got realization. See, how they enjoy Me. See, how sweet you are now. They are very sweet. There are so many children, born everywhere who are realized souls. Now for example this child is more on the right side. This is the children's position here, on the right side. And the people who are on the right side become overactive. And the people who are on the right side become overactive. Not only that, but they develop all the problems on the right side. I don't know if they have any problems on the right side. So you see, you have to first of all, like a car has to move. The car has to move. You see whether it requires the breath or the acceleration. Moreover, when the car goes to a different gate then it will know what is to be done, how to open the gate. But before the car has started moving, how can we decide it beforehand? This is common sense. This is healthful one. That is why anything that you do, you must do it first of all, with attainment of the absolute point. So that relatively you have discretion what is to be done. So that all your activities get related to the Spirit. Now Realization has been very difficult, I know that. And there has been books and books about it. But time has to come where the seekers have decided. Realization is their right to help. That time has come. And this time the Spirit. So according to time, as they call in Sanskrit, Samyacha, they practiced various types. How the human beings were, depending on the krakruti, the nature of human beings. And the modern Sahaja Yoga is nothing but a simple method which I felt that first give them the Realization. See now, this lamp is dirty, so we go on cleaning it, cleaning it through pranayama, other things, cleaning it. Another thing could be, you first put the light on. And then clean it. You can see it better. And you can do it easily. I won't have to tell you, don't do this, don't do that. You yourself will know. Like human nature is very funny otherwise. Now, they are carrying a snake in their hand and you see the snake and you say, throw away the snake. They will not throw. As long as they don't see the snake themselves, they will never throw it. They will argue with you. Till the snake bites them, they will be carrying it. And what's the use of throwing the snake when it has bitten? Because they are ignorance and darkness. So now put on the light and tell them, see what you have got in your hand. So automatically they will throw it away. They will not stick on to it anymore. That is why in this our Sahaja Yoga we first give realization. Then on vibrations you judge yourself. You better be your own guru. So there is no blame on me. This is the method which we call as Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja has too many. Sahaja means spontaneous because it's a living process. Kundalini awakening is a living process of a living force. And also it means, Sahaj means easy. Somebody asked a great saint in the 16th century called Ram Dasa, how much time it takes. He said, that is the moment. But he put a condition that the disciple and the guru should be equipped. The one who does that should be equipped as well as the disciple. But here disciple no conditioning. The disciple and the master both should be equipped. That was the condition he put. Then it was all touched. That's it. But here in Sahaja Yoga in Sahaja Yoga there is nothing like such a condition. As long as you desire to be realized you'll get it. When you see no function, you start to make a difference with Kriyayoga. Then you see self-Kriyayoga. I think, yeah, if you take him out, he'll be all right. It's very such a condition for the children, poor things, you know. Who's the matter? Are you all right now? I'm a bit tired. I think so. If you take him out for a while, he'll be all right. Just remove the oxygen. So now, with this you ask Me no questions. Yes, I'm afraid we didn't explain ourselves very well. The breathing we practice is not pranayama. It is, as a matter of fact, I don't think it is the Indian system at all. It is concerned more or less. There's a certain amount of mindfulness to start the breathing in the circle. And after that the circle takes over it spontaneously, moves to the left, to the right, up and down. So actually we're neither concerned about upward, upward or about the circle. And then the circle does whatever it has. And I think the way thing happens spontaneously. It cannot take. It cannot. But... Continuously it cannot take. The reason I tell you why, because the person, which is, it has brought a little also bad luck to us, because this is a compulsion in any yoga, in any union, that a person who is a realized soul only can be awakened. And that he should be quite, quite an expert to do the job. Otherwise awakening cannot be replaced. You may be cleansed out, but awakening can only take place in a person who is enlightened and of a very perfect condition. Now this has brought us bad luck also, because everybody you see is talking big, this thing, that thing, you know from India, you know how many thugs have come here. But also it's a fact, because one large, which is enlightened, can only enlighten another light. But that doesn't mean you are obliged, that doesn't mean you are in any way dominated, nothing in the country. But he's a catalyst. And that is a guru, which enlightens one life for another. But in Sahaja Yoga we have no guru also. Because the enlightenment takes place, you become your own guru. There is nothing like a single guru, but once you have reached a certain state, what we call as Nirvikalpa Savadhi, where it is doubtless awareness, is a state, is the state of your awareness, of your consciousness. When you reach that state, then you yourself can give realization to others, you yourself can do everything, you can cure people, you know everything about it. You're very knowledgeable people, that's it, because the knowledge is all within. But the door has to be opened. And it is such a system in which the enlightened soul can be opened. Sub-guru is the one who is an enlightened soul can open. Why Radha Janaka had to do for Nachiketa? Nachiketa could not do it himself. But that doesn't mean a guru takes money from everyone, he dominates everyone, tortures, it's not, that's the middle line, not at all. A guru is a compassionate personality. But here I'm not a guru, I'm your Mother. And Mother, you know, is always a guru, but she is a compassionate. Not only that, but what is the desire of her Mother, is always that her children should get all her powers and they should shine, more than us. That's what she wants. What does she want? Yes. She will do it. She will give you the transition, the mention, the guru, that you are not in the right place. It is very important that when a person wants to be a guru, that he can make himself a guru. A guru is a person. And that is the other part. And she has to say, in Sahaja Yoga she is always a guru, she has to say that she is always a mother. And a mother is always a guru for her children. It has a very big snag in it, no doubt, because as I told you yesterday, that about only a hundred years back it happened, that people started describing a funny method, a new method as Shaktipata. It is a very big problem. It is a very big problem, but as for the people who are suffering from this new method, they are called Shaktipata. It is nowhere mentioned in the whole of Mejna, anywhere, this word Shaktipata. This is the word that is used in the whole of Mejna. In the whole of Patanjali, it's not mentioned. Traditionally nobody knows about Mejna. Only about this word I came to know from people who were suffering from troubles from their gurus. And they told Me this word. I said, where is this word? So this is some new style of thing people have started, which is actually a tantric stuff, is a stuff by which you get possessed, is a misfortunes. The gentleman who wrote a book for, his name was Vishnu Theodh, who was I think must have died about sixty, seventy years back. And this fellow was really absolutely on the wrong lines, because he's just started a new sort of a thing and a new thing appeals to the right-sided people. You see, whatever you're seeking is based on tradition. We have come from Amoeba to this stage. Like this electricity has developed through tradition of search on electricity. So it has no relevance whatsoever. It's a movement which just attracts the subconscious to play its part. Or the supraconscious, that is the right side, to play its part. We can say that certain people use the left side, some people use the right side. So that's a possession thing. And this, with this possession, you are physical, mental, emotional being is hurt. It is, if it is the left-sided, if it is the left side, if it is the left side, movement of that is. But if it is the right side, then a person himself doesn't suffer, but he aggresses others. He becomes very ambitious. He thinks turned off himself and he goes on destroying others. Like a marathon sail of cancer. So this is what it is that we must understand. That the whole thing has a science behind it, which has nothing to do with only Indian philosophy. All the great prophets and incarnations have talked about the Kundalini. Like Mohammed Zabna, who calls Kundalini as Asas. And he said that in the resurrection time, your hands will speak. That is exactly what happens in Sahaja Yoga, that your hands start speaking through your chakras. Lao Tze has talked about it. Confucius, Socrates, that you are to be born again, has been said very clearly by Christ. Now in the Bible what we hear about Holy Ghost is the one is the Kundalini. Now in Sahaja Yoga we can prove, we can prove actually the existence of our centers, the existence of all these incarnations in us. It can be proved to you. It is no movement with the darkness or arbitrary behavior. How we prove it now, I tell you, supposing I say that Christ is on the Agnya chakra. When the Kundalini rises, if She stops at Agnya, you have to take His name. Now if the Kundalini stops at a particular center, then you have to take the name of the deity on that particular center. This is the knowledge one has to have. That's all. Now supposing, now supposing this finger is burning. Now this represents the Nabhi chakra. If you see the back of the person, you will be surprised that at the Nabhi center the vertebrae will be out, out of place. The vertebrae will be out of place. The person who is suffering from liver, for example, if you see the back side of such a person, you will be amazed that the spinal cord will be uneven and will be jetting out. Now if you know how to give it a proper help, then you can improve that center and the Kundalini rise. So it is a process which proves all the incarnations, all the scriptures and all that so far has been said about our evolution. And about this is written in a book called The Bible, The Bible is the Bible. It is written in the Bible. And about this is written in a book called Nadi Granth by Prabhu Muni, who lived thousands of years back, who was the pioneer of astrology. That such a thing will happen, that the Kundalini will rise, Sahaj, spontaneously and people will get their realization. It's a great description, it's a complete book. But that is what is happening. If you happen to read the book, if you can get it, I don't think it is translated in English, you will see that all that is said there is happening. So the Sahaj also means effortless. For example, there is a seed and you want to sprout. Now the Mother Earth has a capacity to sprout. And to sprout is the nature of the seed. Now when you put the seed in the Mother Earth, you don't do anything. It just sprouts like so. You are all equipped? So why do any efforts you have done, radha and last lives quite a lot? There's no need for it to go away. You are not seekers of today. You are seekers of ages. If you can eat this way, why go round and round? As simple as that. As a mother I say, I have done the cooking. You better eat, if you are hungry you will have. If you are not hungry, then you will ask Me how I cooked it, how I bought it and all that. Now this line is here. If you want to have it on, you just switch on there. And it's on because it is built in that way. But supposing you say, first describe to us how electricity has come and how then what is the history of electricity, it would be boring. It's already there, just have it. Why bother? I have done the job for you. Now you don't have to bother. I have done all pranayama, everything for you, finish. There is no need because you are all ready for it. It is so neat. Now let's have it. Let's see how many are you feeling, the fullness. Let's put the hands like this. This is the chaitanya, this is the pranava, not the prana. Pranava is the one when the prana is enlightened. Pranava is the one when the prana is enlightened. What I want to say is that the prana is the one who is enlightened. You don't feel it, you must have. It is you who has to judge yourself. Nobody has. Just see on top of your head. Shri Mataji, little higher, little higher. Slowly, it's very subtle. Look. Now put your right hand and we see with the left hand. Left hand. You just feel better with the left. Because right is heavy, I feel. Now ask a question in your heart. Is this pranava? Is it the Brahma Shakti? Is this the All Pervading Power of God? Is that the Alice de St. Is it that the Holy Ghost? Is that the Harlequin? You can keep your eyes open, it's all right. You are in thoughtless awareness. You are in in which are some of the already. Now done. See now, let's start. After realization you have to do practice. Not before. Now just practice. With understanding, with discrimination, with knowledge. Not happens. Not happens. Most of you have right side problem. Put left like this. Left is going to the sky, the right. Better? Little body. It's all right. Now don't be worried. You have to be pleasantly pleased about it. You are entering into the realm of the Divine. You should say one thing. The mantra, because the center is catching on Earth. But you see, there is anotherone. Everybody everywhere, Somewhat from where, But somewhere right in the center. You hear or hear the word? because this center is catching. Here it is. Mother, I'm not guilty. Put it in your heart of hearts. Not to feel guilty at all. You are a saint. Just forgive yourself. Catch him still. What do you say? Forgive everyone. Forgive, forgive, forgive. The science you need a man. Silence. Silence. You have to forgive, madam. Forgive everyone. Most forgive. From your heart. Just forgive them. I know because you are saints. Nobody can understand you. But you are not so badly off. Imagine the saints of the past. How much they suffer? The science you need a man. Forgive them. I know it was hard. So now I have to go to the program. Can you just see Her vibrations? Yes, it's all right. Little upset. You see, she's on top. Why is now rich? She has. She's on top. Left to the right. Just put her. Not the bounces at all. She doesn't have any She doesn't have any. Once more, tie it down. Now see. Are you feeling it now better? See, that's fine. That's fine. All right? So it's the science of the divine. Which you can master. All of you. Everyone can become a great master. So we have here, I don't know if you have books in now. This thing or something. And they have follow on program here. Yes, this is come. Why not? Today I'm going to talk about the Spirit. Better come. Come to the program now. Come to the program, Shri Mataji.

It's a real, a real first of the actions. It's a real. But the talent is discovered earlier in age. He doesn't know that you have a talent. The amount of attention that you feel in the reading are still minutes. So you can pick up, but I don't know it. Now at this age, they have to start story early. But our children are thinking of giving the violence in the school there. And then you can appoint a very good violent teacher. So all these young children, they will come out. I'm thinking of giving them violence. That would be tremendous. I can give you very good teachers, young boys or young girls. They are all my own students, so they will give proper guidance to small children. Small or big? Boys and girls are grown up. They are in the university. They are taking training from me. But in Japan, they have tried very small children between 8 to 12 years of age. They played very well. In fact, I started at the age of 3. She started at the age of 3 and a half. So that was the age. I need not... She must have an attitude. But all these Sahaja Children, they will definitely have an attitude. That would be wonderful. You know yesterday, that little boy of Jeremy, he was never like Jeremy. He went and pushed his arms around my neck and said, Mataji, did you say that Ganesha's mother told you never to say no and never to ask why? Did you say so? I said, I must have said, no. No, in the video I never heard. But my mother says so, but I never heard. Oh! So where does she hear this? Jeremy needs to be... He has the courage to come and ask you, huh? He needs to be directly to you. I said, but you should not ask your mother too many questions and also you should not say no to her. It's alright. It's not on the video. It's not on the video. Ah ha! He knew he was insisting. If I see on the video, that's the last thing. End of it. For me, I don't know how they have such tremendous respect, these children. One word from me, they say, will tell this to Mataji, they are finished. That's the greatest punishment. Realized souls, they are born with it. Even yesterday, they were all making noise. Somebody came and Mataji is speaking over the telephone. She is finding it's very difficult. All of you have to keep quiet. Everybody became quiet. All small souls in this world. Here they are very small. This is preschool. This is the first school. We don't manage them. There we have a regular from six years. Here we have below. Also the condition of the children in these western countries is very bad. Very bad. So they wanted to have some place in India where they could educate. Luckily we got this kind of shala. We are just working it out. And we are into Puchipuli dancing is there. She came all the way from Madras. Do you know of any guru in Madras whose name is Bujanda? Bujanda? Teaching what damn? Guru Bujanda. Nay, I have not come. In Austria somebody has sent me that letter. I don't know who is in the letter. Philip. I have brought it. Yes, Shri Mataji. I saw that. I never heard his name. I don't know who he is. I think it is some self made man. I have the feeling. Guru Bujanda. I have never heard. I know about one. Bujanda. Who was the one who sort of translated Guru Bali's book? On Nandigram. What is it? Nandigram. When they have predicted? Nandigram. Nandigram. So that's another one. But he is dead now. So I just don't understand who is this new one. They are sending us invitation. Pukul Purnima. I mean they have already their own. But whatever it is, I wanted to know because he is from Madras. What surprised me is that in the paper they say that the Holy Spirit is the Kundalini. And you are the only one who ever said that. So I really think they must have picked it from you. Because. There is one fellow, that Bangalore fellow. I don't know what he has written in his book. Who has written a book about Sahaja Yoga? Which is sold everywhere in another state. But I told him that without Realization he should write first so that it is a third person. Now he has got his Realization. His name is Radhesh. Something. I met him. You met him? So the same fellow must have mentioned this. So they must have taken it from there. Because he says that Holy Ghost, the Kundalini can be called as Radhesh. He also said that. So why do you think, you see they take words from these books and maybe that was written. This book we are rather exposed. Because it's selling everywhere. But the difference between a western mind and this thing I saw. Because Gopi Krishna's disciple came there once. And he wanted to know about Sahaja Yoga and all that. So Robert told me and when I come around Gopi Krishna. And another is Rosatka and Swami. You see it's all absurd to believe that the sex power can become Kundalini. I mean absurd. I mean it has to be dharmic. Isn't it? How can we earn a dharmic sky? But they believe it. They just want to believe in it. So I told him that I'm sorry I can't do it. Because this chakra he'll be wrong. But still he was insisting. Then he went away and he met this Radhesh. He told that if you want to have realization it's only Mother who can give you realization. And don't be in all nonsensical things otherwise she will not like it. Then he came next time. He got his realization. So this is what they want to sort of propagate. Which is absolutely wrong and also can give problems of any dimension. It's very wrong to bring people in the realm of God. It's wrong. But what is the problem of Buddhism? And there are two shakayas I would say. Two basic you can say problems. One is that one talks of Buddha's bhakti, this that and all that. And another one which is intellectual. The intellectual ones have gone into the head of the Western people. And if they are going to go this way already they are doomed. And they are going to be now finished if they go on like this. It has to be holy. Bhavitra is very important. If you don't have bhavitra how can you talk of Kundalini? I can't understand. So then he said but this one has written that one. I said see authenticity you should get from saints. What about Adi Shankaracharya? What about Markimaya? What about Nanaka? What about Ganeswara? They are the people who are real authority. Who are these? But after Buddha I think they all went helpless getter. They pulled them. They were not that real. But I don't know why the Westerner liked all these stupid ideas. He suits them I think or works on their weaknesses. So he's, I said what research I'm doing with Satyanand. Satyanand is the saints right? Then he woke up. He is a character of Karchamajaya Guru Granth. He is Satyanand fellow for Mughin. Horrible piece. And he said this is how Kundalini is going to be awakened. Rajamishtai. But Indians don't believe in it normally. But there are these Germans now using the way. Germans and Japanese. Now that's the last bit. For Rajanisht. But Shri Mataji what I feel is that both male and female or man and woman have constructive and destructive power. And I feel now that the destructive power of woman has been released. Because as long as a woman has chastity she is constructive. But if their chastity is broken in a woman she can completely finish man off. Because they have this power. And what I see of the society is that this destruction is now going on through the woman. This is what's happening. That's it. The women are much more active in it. Absolutely. In America especially the women are absolutely. They have lost all sense of justice. Not only in America anywhere I mean. I would say in Germany. Holland. Most of them have done it. But drugs are legally allowed. Legally allowed? Legally allowed. It's a hell. How I have my questions you know. But they are something different. But otherwise it's hell. Drug allowed them offers. They have all out legally. And they have to be. World court is there. What a justice it is. They are going to be foreigners for you? Foreigners. I hope. John Eilers. From the window? Yes. For Samhita who will some music later? Then, backing shall be pleased. This says Territory is up against Skill?? F Let's say that theath seminar at the most. it little gap So now we have found a proper channel and also combined together all such people who were in that area, that they were having Nati Sandeet or Nati Sangeet Kesarthi Nata. Don't go subjang yam to mind it or we'll create an atmosphere for that. In the same way, we have to create a place for our children. Don't go subjang yam to mind it or we'll create an atmosphere for that. In the same way for classical music also. So we are going to do that in Marathi later on in Delhi area and all that. Sabna Awad's for one of these are these program. I said I'm very tired. I've heard her so many times but that I was very tired. So I said I won't be able to go. So she was telling me that what a difference it was. There were only 150 people somehow sitting and in between they would get up, walk out, smoke and ultimately only 25 were left. And she said they had no understanding. I don't know why they were there. They were not enjoying it like that. It's very surprising. And she said compared to what I saw in your programs, they are so rich, tremendous difference and that's how they feel encouraged also. If nobody understands you, they are just singing before stones. It's a question of creativity. In Delhi, there was a law and order situation. How did you feel? I felt very good. I was very happy. I remember once they had my program. So they said we put us, this is not today, this is about 3 years back. Amzad would like to play. So I said I put his name also in there. So more people might come. So when my program was over, everything was done, he said now Amzad are living, playing. Half of them got a cut, cut, cut, cut and went. They won't stay for a program. 50% absolutely left and 25% left. Only Sahaja Yogis were sitting. This gave the high meanings. The high meanings are superficial. Superficial it is said. But now you will all spread out because Haryana is there, then we went up to the era room, Lucknow maybe, Mahal Sir Logan. Lucknow is a place where we used to have so much music. It's also finished there. But now with Sahaja Yoga I'm sure this will spread there. Mother asked Me, Mother asked Me very, Mother asked Me, very... They don't aspire for ascent. Why any? Let should come in. After all, in My lecture of course there will be lots. But afterwards they don't follow Sahaja Yoga. You have to become. Sahaja Yoga is the becoming. that you are a Sahaja Yogi. This is coming. I tell you in India the people are very amazed when we went to these shops to buy all the classical tapes. All the ragas, series of all the ragas we were buying, we were buying so many Sahaja Yogi, all the classical tapes were finished now. And then the Indian used to come and buy all these rocks and pumps. See, in India it happened that our Sahaja Yogis had gone to buy some classical tapes. And then they were buying, the Gujarati's were buying all that kind of things. So the Indian said, what do you enjoy in this thing? You have so much in your own music. Why, what do you want to do? He said, this is nonsense. You know they had an argument. I said, once it was my childhood I had issues to feel that this music of our spirit must break out over and spreading out very fast. This is not a song which is written in the Indian language. This is a song which is written in the Indian language. This is not a song which is written in the Indian language. I saw the little girl who had come. Then I saw her. She was the first woman to come to India. She was the first woman to come to India. I was the first woman to come to India. She was the first woman to come to India. So when she came to India, she had to apply for some kind of competition or something. He came into the finals round. I am sure you will be able to do that. I am sure you will be able to do that. You have to do it. No. You have to do it. You are talented. You are a great singer. What is the difference between South India and India? You have to do it. You have to do it. You have to do it. So they are from South India. And the way she played the day Paffi Dada was just in penavas style. I was amazed because they say after all it's a very different style. But nothing is there. They say, Of course that South Indian music is also very very nice. No doubt about it. I enjoy both of them. But in the purity of it, really I am amazed. I said Chinti Babu also has played before me that he gave up his Sharab. He gave up completely. His Sharab he gave up. Even the Amzad Ali kapowat apne wahis a jamata that finished. He told on, I don't know, publicly he said that. That we had a wife. Remember Amzad Ali. Openly, who is the wife that I am. The mother will have good children and all that. She was also a dancer as well. When it comes to art, they don't care. When it comes to art, they compromise. I know him since long when he was nobody. I helped him a lot at that time. About the same time when I met him, he had come to me. So he remembered me and all that. He is like a Sufi now. So he told me that whenever you have a program, I must come and sing. So he came and he was there last day. In that program. But why pair went Shunab, I say before. Or Safka pair Shue. Or Piruske Bhandi, who Bajan Bighai. Who is Bajan? Ramas. One Ramas Bajan. Two, three songs he is. I have this guy. I have this guy. I have seen all these issues. Milk. Milk at your feet, all right. I have this guy, Nihapad Nishaat Khan. They are able to say. Allara kapirat kane. Oh, Safka pair Shue. They allow me pair Shue. So I was like, I don't want to be a bad person. They all touch my feet. Normally Muslims are not allowed to touch my feet. But when it comes to music, then they touch my feet and sing bajans. Bismillah karash nahi hai. Bismillah karash nahi hai. Bismillah karash nahi hai. Baju hai, mein uso sab. Baju hai. Bih kar nahi kumai, hai kapai sab karash banadi. Pure money. Tumane kar bhi nam to banadi hai. Tumane kar bhi nam to banadi hai. Tumane kar bhi nam to banadi hai. Tumane kar bhi nam to banadi hai. Tumane kar bhi nam to banadi hai. He was going to come for this program. Tumane kar bhi nam to banadi hai. Don't put down. But his debut was still good. Kahane dili hanya hai lete? Nahi kamar guy, hi hai kik. Where was his program? In Paris. In Paris. In Paris. In Paris. Ahchau, he didn't come. He came all the way from. He was performing in Jigra. He came all the way to Paris. He came for my birthday in Kumbh Kaur. But he came to Paris from Switzerland. Samap le lek hai kar kar hai. Tuk tu baht. Ist hai mein kar ungaat ke hai. You see they told me the police that you don't have any program there. Lots of Muslims are staying. They might put a bomb on you. I said what sort of Muslims are staying? They said mein zaam udni nawli ya. I said that's our, they are our people. I said really? I said it's in 19, ah, I think it was, 48 or 49. I was the first to put a charter on that. Nobody was bothered with just lying like that. Now it has grown up so much. Ah, so I told these people that you go to his mother and put the charter. When they put the charter and all that, you see, they came in the program officially. But chief pleased I have every day chatur de kya hai. He said you must come at the time of Rosa to be, Rosa chur kana. So about 4 o'clock he called, please come. When I went there, they asked me to vibrate all their food and also to eat a little bit of that. And again he gave me a chatur and I mean no woman is allowed, you see, but she do things like this. It's too much you see. That's right. Your divine diplomacy. Ah. Your divine diplomacy. And then the whole thing was about the Muslims was over. They all came to our program and it was all. Then there is also dam dam sab sati mein. That is a fattishar or another saint, Shoo Shoo. He was a Sikh gentleman. So many Sikhs came from there. They got realization. So they said, you know, come landar ke landam. America to me and landar ka. Such friendship, such love. This is a middle-line, they run. Ninte jalan mein chakta. Maat mushki. Das sufi ho da hai.

Sorry I had to little bit help him with his hand. So as you have heard these young artists, you could see in their innocence how creative they were and attention so concentrated. It's true, I am telling them, I know you have to sometimes get hurt and you get pain also doesn't matter because it's only Indian people who can really sing or play this music. I mean Indian artists you can call them, they may be from Bangladesh or from Pakistan, they are really basically Indians as far as the art is concerned. So you shouldn't mind if you are hurt or anything because you are the only people you can do this. It's difficult for Western people to take to this kind of music and to become masters, very difficult. So we have seen of course one or two people who have tried but it's very difficult. Like this Yawdi Mehanin, supposed to be a great artist and all that, I have seen him with Ravi Shankar. Poor Ravi Shankar was trying to play with him like a baby, you know. Absolutely, just couldn't play with him. It was just so, he didn't know how to play, he felt that way. So it's a great thing that these young people have taken to classical Indian music. Normally nowadays you are all enjoying this music while young people in India, in the city specially, like to have your pop music. So this art can be only kept alive by these young people who understand the value of this classical music. Unless and until they really adhere to it, I once felt that we are going to lose completely our heritage. But some or other it has worked out that I see now even younger generation is doing it. And also I have seen very young, very, very young, two years to ten years as I told you, children being born who know this music just spontaneously. So this great music must be saved. And there should be people who can play it, who can sing it, who can elaborate it. And of course there should be listeners like you. Because they are all saying that because you are so good at listening it that they felt absolutely at home and they enjoyed your company and such a audience they have never seen such a great, great, silent and good one which was understanding and was absorbing everything. So they are very much thankful to you for that. So it should not be any compulsion on you but gradually you will realize that it's a very intricate, difficult and melodious Divine music and we should develop our ears to enjoy it. The only trouble in Kabela I find that nothing starts before ten o'clock. Whatever one may try. I was ready since eight o'clock. So they said now they have gone for their food. Then all right. I said, now is it all right, now is it all right. So there is no timing for it. You see somehow I have seen but you enjoy everything, it's all right. What does it matter if it is late or earlier? For tomorrow they are going to have a heaven. Maybe here they will try, I don't know where their idea is. They can do it here also, it's a good idea. And in the afternoon, in the evening time we'll have our pujas. That would be better I thought. I hope you are not hungry or you are enjoying your food and everything is all right. May God bless you all.

She is saying that she is very happy that she has since one year inside yoga. She already has an emotion. She is very not sure. Not sure. She feels. You have to forgive. If you forgive, then what can I do? You don't have a problem. No problem. No, because I can't forgive for you. I can't forgive for you. I can't forgive for you. I can't forgive for you. Because I can't forgive for you. He says he hasn't got problems of forgiveness. Yes. Now feel it. So you go on forgiving everyone. You can't forgive. So what is it? Is it a burden? Yes. It's so good. It's very good. Better give realization to others now. It's very good. Ask her to give realization to others. It's very good. It's very good. It's very good. Mother, I feel very good. Is he going to die? He died. His father died. His father is still recalling his death. Oh! Why do you want to torture his life? He is going to die. He is going to die. He is going to die. It's very good. Don't leave him alone. Tell him that you should take your birth again. I'm all right. Please tell him. I would like to ask people who already know that he has to let the child go through his first birth. Go on telling your father. Every time. So he will feel rested. Since very few days he is coming. He is not sure of feeling properly the vibrations. It's very old. He has been to some other guru world. Some other guru world. He has not been to a family. Maybe yes, but he actually sold only for little time. He is even a mile. He is a master of the ministry. Say it ten times. Ah! Are you feeling now? It's empty. Feeling or not? He is saying yes. This is your guru's problem a little bit. They are telling what is to be done. So? You felt the cool breeze? You felt the cool breeze? Now? He is in a little bit. He is in a little bit. He is still can. He has the impression of feeling hot. He didn't know if it was right. But now? What else? What else is there? Feel! Ah! The feel. All right? He is in a little bit. He is in a little bit. All right. He is in a little bit. I will give it to you. She always feels hot. And the traditions. What is the meaning of the word? He had some guru or something? He had some guru. He had some nice. He was doing sport. Sport. Sport. Nothing. He is over-thinking, you know? What sport should he play? He is a little bit. Little bit. Let's give up. It's only. What is your protector now? What is his protector? You need control very nicely. On your heart and back like this. On your heart and back like this. This is the heart. Better not do that. It's better now. See? Don't do these things. We got this. I'm following the program but I won't do meditation. She comes to the program so she doesn't meditate. Yes, that's it. Why not? See, without meditation you'll not grow. You have to little bit start some putting on some music. And you'll feel better. And it's only a very short time in meditation. But without that you won't grow in spirituality, you won't enjoy life and you should. So just tell yourself that it is little time for My Self also. Right? Feel welcome. That's too good. All right. Only about ten minutes in the night if you can do it. She's very happy to be here with you, very very happy with your feelings. Since little time in Sahaja Yoga only one month. She's doing well. Very good. You're all right. You're all right. Thank you very much. You had a sound and you are more. Often we have a simple feeling that we don't remember. Thank you. Thank you for doing well in this world. We are very happy to be here. Thank you very much. You are very welcome. Thank you very much. Better forgive. Little bit. What do you do? I do a little bit. He's studying at the university. Engineering. As an engineer. Very nice. Listen liver problem. You come and see them all right? They'll tell you what is to be done. Yeah, little liver is there. All right? I'm happy you're here. Sometimes I feel the cold breeze. Other times as tonight I felt hot. Here it's hot. It's all right. Maybe you can see liver. I think I'll see you later. Thank you. You're all right. Thank you. You're very welcome. You are very welcome. You also come and see them. You do have a little liver problem. Thank you very much. I have a problem with the liver.

All right. We only wanted to thank you. One question. Yes, yes. Jesus Christ, is that on the cross or on some sort of a stick? He died on the cross but he was resurrected. After resurrection he went to India. And then he died there. He's got the problems in his eyes. What is the problem? He's a painter. He's an artist. That's why. All right. He's child. He's a painter. He's a painter. He's a painter. All right. You come and see them. I'll tell them what is to be done. He's happy to have met you. He didn't feel the cool breeze, actually. No, he didn't. He had been to some guru or somebody of course. Was it a welcome guru? No. Are you married? Not yet. You'll marry, isn't it? No, no, no. Once you say, I will marry, it's all right. She's been there for years. He's been there for years. I'd like to tell her there was a disselaide with all the people. He's walking the garden. Are you going to give him the confidence? I was going to ask that. Yeah, he'll like you in the door. We're all kinds of people. Everyone. No? Sure? Let's see. On his head, just sit. There is some kid, but not that one. Now forgive, forgive everyone. It's going on. It's a little bit more. I feel a bit chaste. It's a bit better. It's impossible. It's not yet. Did you smoke? No. I think it's more important to have a good marriage. I have a lot of friends who are very happy. You must see it by the fact that you mentioned marriage. It's a special thing. You see, marriage also is very important. It is very important. And to lead a good married life. It's important to have a positive marriage. All right? Now he's got it. All right? How are you? After a long time? Hi. How are you keeping? How about you? I feel depressed. This is Sonia, the new wife. She's a new fiancé. Her new wife. He wants your blessing. Give you the benedict. She's coming from Brazil. Really? In Brazil we have lots of Sahaja Yogis. Where do you live? In Rio? All right. So give them the I-Brasil. I think she has already. You have already that? Give My love to them. He's happy to meet you. Yes, he's got it. Very well. Now you have to give. It's like one light enlightens another. And that light has to enlighten others. So you must learn technique. Very simple. All right. Feel the cool breeze? Good. You see the Italian? Yes. He got me. Where are you? He's at Facebook. He didn't feel much. What does he do? Cosify. He worked for theatre. Theatre? The theatre. Better? Thank you. Thanks too much. See you. Don't think. Better now? Feeling it? Come to the ashram. All right, and master it. All right, so I'll remove all. One lady journalist here, one of the main newspapers. Is it Yogi or? It's a Yogi. This gentleman over there. He's all right. You felt the cool breeze? You felt the cool breeze? What has happened in his brain? What's your name? Minneh Joma. When will you get it? It's kind of a cancer. So you should come and see me. We need a gentleman. All right, please come. All right? It's all right. I'm sorry. Mr. Basim. She wanted to ask you three questions. Einstein was saying that the true value of a man can be measured on the fact that he can overcome his ego, the I-ness. What does it mean for Sahaja Yogi? It's wonderful. Thank you. What happens that after realization you have got problems in your ego or in your conditionings. You can make them out on your fingertips. How does this work? Einstein was a realist. He said that he can overcome ego and condition. What does it mean? How to overcome this? Now, you see, on your fingertips, if you feel on the right hand side here, this is the finger for the ego. This is the ego, this is the ego. And the ego is between the optic chiasma, you see. There is a center called agnya, optic chiasma inside the brain, agnya, which is a optic chiasma, you see, where these eyes, the nerves of the eyes cross each other. He's a doctor? May I say? Yes, that's what I'm saying. You see, this, what happens that on that center is besides Christ. This center is called Christ. Christ is the center of the body. He is a ghost, a non-human being. He is a very beautiful, very beautiful, very beautiful. For a beer we Him, the That is a very beautiful, a very beautiful, a very beautiful. Yeah, yeah, it's true, true, correct, correct. She's asking how Sahaja Yoga can do that. Ah, I see. Now, you see, what we do without realization, you see, we do it through our ego only. Shri Mataji, shri Mataji, tuto go logenu efachamo prima del esperienzo della religione lo fachamo sotto tanto coni nostro ego. Now, where do you get your realization? Then this pouch of ego is sucked in. Quando si rechevelo a religione, questo paulone del lego, viene comeri sukiato. All right. Now, then again it comes back. Le que su ciue? Oi, pero a cadaire e gi returna, que si, si rigonfia. Now, what we have to do at that time, we have to just say, I forgive everyone, I forgive everyone. Quando ci accorjamo di questo ego, prendo su prevento, quero vido bemo dire e o perdono tupti. So that, you see, this is the mantra of Christ. Quisto e mantra del Christo. But after realization. Quisto, broccio fatto vo la religione, dovo o experiences a del religione. Also I can turn it, you see, that thing, I can turn it with My finger like that. Come forward this way. De posto fattave della copiao di odoppo cosine odo. This way, turn it. Just come forward, please. You see, when ego is not there, you don't feel. E quando lego non ci esta... You become thoughtlessly aware. ...de ventiamo sensa benciare. E queso e semangrado di esta recunzape o relucibi ma sensa benciare, no ci disturba. It's good, both your hands. She thinks too much. E lei ben sadro. Veramin te sto, fessando il avuro, me fessando il adre. She's saying, she's working, I can't, how can't she think? After realization she'll get inspiration. E doppo la religione, seri ci uno de lei spirazione. And if you want to think, you'll think, otherwise you'll not think. E se buliamo benciare, penciamo, penciamo. Attrimenti in penciamo, semo libe. Now, do you watch Me without thinking? Can you do, can you watch Me without thinking? E sio be darei, svete gi sensa benciare. E queso o muito, no. No, just try, you haven't tried. Just try. E sei, she has the mountains of thinking. This is the mountains here that she is living in. That's the problem. This has to go down. Now, is she feeling the whole breeze? She's feeling the whole breeze. Is she feeling the whole breeze? Se te la brezza tresque. It's coming, yes? It's hot, it's coming hot. Very hot. Now, alright, one simple thing, you just say, Mother, I forgive everyone. You say it from your heart. I forgive everyone. In your heart you say that. Just say that. Se pit, valeke mocha kunche sh creations et prunche annually Yes, but not at all. All right, it will work out. Now, don't give up. Shhh. I'm trying to give you a balance, that's all. You are more intellectual, restless, emotional. How better? What do you say? It's coming hot, yes, but it's better. Coming hot? Yes, it's coming out. We can solve this problem of tension of many, but it will go to psychologists, not to us, because we don't take any money. Yes, but we can solve this problem of tension of many people, but it will go to psychologists, not to us, because we don't take any money. The ego takes attention, everything. The cause of the ego takes attention to the stress. No, but it's better. It's better after, so I don't believe a man does. May she make some questions? In this experience of Sahaja Yoga, there were some very important persons of the public and political. There are persons who did Sahaja Yoga and they improved, they changed their way of doing. Some of them did. Politicians don't take to spirituality. Normally politicians don't take to spirituality. Normally. Bureaucrates? Yes, because they are the industrial companies, because they are the industrial companies. What can you say? She wants to know the name of the important people who are doing Sahaja Yoga, who have changed their lives. Our Commander in Chief in India. The Commander in Chief in India. Commander in Chief? The Commander in Chief. But you don't write it in the newspaper. I get your right. Then don't write. Why not? Because, you see, I don't want to count all the people whom I have given Realization, it's not graceful. I'm doing it out of grace, you see, it's not. Supposing you invite somebody to give love, you don't write it to you. I know somebody, please. What's the use? You write your own experience. You should never, because it's love. There's a big grace about it. I never give any names. I never give. You see. Now, there are... ...people who are not practicing this Yoga. All Buddhism. What is it that is there that is beyond? And put in the way of influencing their own positive and positive lives. And I know that you don't know anything about it. What's he saying? He's asking whether there are people who have been influencing the political facts of the world because of Sahaja Yoga. You say that. Because, you see, Sahaja Yoga has nothing to do in the influencing and all that. It is something inner. You see, and it has to be an experience. It has to be an honest experience. It cannot be just because somebody is big, so we get an advertisement. We don't deal in that. It is an inner experience. It is not a thing of the climate, of the public, because it is so important. But it is an inner experience. It is an experience that can be lived, or can be sensitive. This experience is transmitted to the world. It is transmitted to the world. As it is an inner process, it has to show outside. No, but it is a matter of time. If you want to show, you have to show it by bringing them along. See, it's open to everyone. Now, we can say in Russia, there are thousands who come and very big scientists and doctors have come. But they have sensitivity. They have seekers. They have seekers and they have sensitivity. You see, you have to have sensitivity. Let's see how. Out of chimpanzees, supposedly human beings are made of this. I understand your anxiety. I understand your anxiety that you want any people to know about. But the main problem is that how many want their realization. How many politicians you think are seeking the truth? You just tell me. In Italy? In Italy. In Italy. It's making a difference between politicians and those who are practicing politics in a sense. Politician, maybe there is someone, but the other kind is... My own brother is a politician. He is a cabinet minister. He doesn't want to do Sahaja Yoga. He says you cannot mix politics and science. He got it before he came in. She is saying that if this commander in chief is still leading an organization, he is going to be a leader. He is going to be a leader. He is going to be a leader. He is saying that if this commander in chief is still leading an army, there is a contradiction. No, no, no, no, no, contradiction. You can go and see him if you like. No question. But you see, he got his realization long time back. That's why. Now he has become commander. They have to come and see me if they want. If they have to come, they will come. And I don't want to use their name, just for publicity to those who have to come, then come. You can't change the negative or positive through your system. You exist or you don't exist. But I think it is important that we are not diverse. We don't want to say names. She wants to know the names of the important people who got here. I will not say names. Why should I? Why should you ask for names from there? I think it is important that we are not educated. I can't understand. We are not educated. But we came. I will not. You see, it is all done in complete understanding. It is not done like a publicity stunt, you know. Me they are not important. Me they are not important in doing everything. Me they are not just the same. Makes no difference to Me. It is for them to say, not Me to say. But I agree. She is dropping from Her angle. You see, I can understand what She is saying is from Her angle that if I can say that all those people who got position by that, many people will come to Sahaja Yoga. There is no need to give temptation to anyone. I never eat. It amounts to this. That I am saying that I gave realization to all these people so they have become politically very important that they should come. I am sorry but... See now, just tell her this one you got. You tell her... No, no, listen, listen. It is interesting. Now what it is that you are trying to tell Me that I should tell you how many people got into a political ascent, political powers because of Sahaja Yoga. Which I don't say because I never say that that Sahaja Yoga will give you political powers, no question. It gives you spiritual powers. No, it doesn't matter. No, no, no. To her political is very important. To me they are not. See, half of your politicians are in the jail. What's the use of giving them realization? I am concerned about the politics. Same in our country. But not for the people who are in jail. They are in jail. I am concerned about the people who are in jail. I understand, but I don't understand. I understand what you are saying. I understand. I don't understand. I am not concerned. I am not concerned. I am not concerned about the people who are in jail. I can understand. Thank you, sir. My husband was a top postman in the US and he wants that I should give realization to some great human people. I invited to the film the Alkune World, the Alaric Program, the International Unity. We have a lot of artificial and neural unity. We have to do it in the organization, but this is not important. For me, artificial and neural unity is not as important as a real reality of the spiritual world. We can do it. We can do it. Yes, we can do it. By giving realization, they are in pain. You see, not for them. Not there. You see, there he may not speak through the image of Sahaja Yoga. This point. There he may not know this. We are Sahaja Yogis and we are all Sahaja Yogis. I cannot put it more. That is good. And could you use the pain system, please? It is the hang of theextras of Allah. Look here in the screen. Now it's mine! If not then what better experience could be offered? We have Keep A and the perception of the world. This is a description of the world's tradition and if you have a point of view of mythology, of the story of religion and one of anthropology, and the possibility of work and deterrence in all world civilizations. This is a description of the world's tradition and the possibility of work and deterrence in all world civilizations. The possibility of experiencing self-realization is to meet someone who can lead the process. Now I would like just to introduce Shri Mataji because she has proven this capacity. I do not want to be too long because Shri Mataji is going to speak herself in a few minutes. Actually if she saw wishes and if you saw desire, she could also at the end of this program lead a meditation in which that experience would be felt by many of you. Shri Mataji is a mother, a grandmother, she is a wife, she knows all the dimensions of our life as householders. She also had a very active diplomatic life because her husband was, as you heard, the secretary general of the maritime organization of the UN and he was knighted by the Queen of England in acknowledgement of his very distinguished services. She has a very active diplomatic life because she is very much a secretary of the UN agency of the UN and she is very much a member of the UN agency of the UN. But what she is really interested in is not all this. What Shri Mataji is interested in is in manifesting the reason for which she has come on this earth and this is to give to those who saw desire access to their own spirit, access to their own self-realization. She has started Sahaja Yoga in about 20 years back, and now Sahaja Yoga is flourishing in something like 56 countries. The benefits of Sahaja Yoga are manifesting themselves in physical health, in psychic balance and overall in a much greater capacity to lead one's life in a dynamic, relaxed and joyful manner. And I would like to say that Sahaja Yoga, based on this physical health, in a much greater physical health, in an oblique, but also in the growing capacity of the human being, gives a very consistent, pure, joyful and deliberate life. To me, somebody who opens such a door is not a normal human being. For me, who is afraid of this, cannot be considered a normal human being. That is why, in the same way that we have to appreciate a tree to its fruit, our very great respect to Shri Mataji is an acknowledgement of the incredible spiritual powers that she has been exhibiting on her whole these last years. It is always difficult to perceive an historical event when it is happening. When the Berlin Wall fell, everybody knew it was history in the making. But when you see 20,000 people getting their realization in the sports stadium of Leningrad, which I saw with Shri Mataji, this is also history in the making. When the Berlin Wall fell, everybody knew it was history in the making. But when you see 20,000 people getting their realization in the football stadium of Leningrad, in a program that Shri Mataji has, it is also history in the making. Because the story of the game is about a level, more than anything. Because technology has more than the source of our brain, but when we see the world, we don't see it as a part of it. This is the area where we see everything. And when we see the world, we don't have the capacity to see this brain, or the body, as the modern technology. And this is the yoga, the yoga of the brain, the yoga of the body, the skin, the brain. And a top of evolution that we have not yet seen in the past, is Shri Mataji, in our experience, the person who can be spiritual and initial to this top of evolution. Shri Mataji, I'm sorry, I think everybody is kind of confused with me jumping from one language to another. And I will now request you to, perhaps, I will ask Andrea to take it from there. Can you just say that I apologize for shifting from a language to another, but I don't want to take too much of that time either. Thank you. IVE Mr. Manet, I rememberiosyn in my time and foregoing and I can say I share the same A true Right Yes Yes We all know just the Leader of all Please ballisticize. Thank you. It's a really very true that so many are in the market because you have the special times. I call them blossom times when there are so many seekers and who want to seek the truth. The seekers don't know what to seek and how to seek. So, you have to be very careful and you have to be very careful. First of all you must know that it is a living process. It is a living thing that is happening. It is an evolutionary process. You have to have your last breath. Now we must understand that you cannot pay for it. You cannot put in any effort. It's your right to have it. So, once they have come to know that there are so many seekers and fruits, they will be able to see that there are so many seekers and fruits. So, a market has started of these gurus. About which I said in 1970 very clearly that there are such people who are really devils and they have come as gurus. There are two best at least you must put. The first one you must find out the disciples. If they have achieved anything, what is their lifestyle? What is the lifestyle of the guru? And the second one is that doesn't take money for his work. And the third one also can be applied to many of them who try to exploit their weaknesses and encourage them. They do not talk of holiness or of purity. Also they do not talk of self-realization. Because they don't know how to do it. So, it is for you to understand that if you are seekers of growth, you must seek for yourself that you don't pay for it. And that those who are disciples or those who are paying to this guru business, what have they achieved? Have they also got some powers? Do they know any modus operandi as to how they work out? Have they also got some powers? Do they know any modus operandi as to how they work out? For example Sahaja Yogis know everything about what is this procedure is. They can cure people, they can give them self-realization and they know everything about it. Within one month you can become an expert. But you don't have to pay for it. Little time you have to give to yourself, that's all. But always we have known that we must pay for God. So we think that we must pay. And that's how we don't even try to doubt these gurus. But we cannot pay for workers. He doesn't understand money, he doesn't understand banking, he doesn't understand. Can you read the question? Can you read the question? Just now I don't think it's the time for me to speak on this subject. Best is that you first get to a circle and see for yourself. Also you should not believe Me, blindfolded. But as scientist you must keep your minds open. And whatever I am saying should be taken on hypothesis. And if it is true, then of course as honest people you have Brexit. Once you get to your Self-realization you will know that all these religions were born on the same tree of spirituality. All these great incarnations and prophets came on this earth to establish spirituality. According to time they put forward the truth. But then people plucked the flowers and then started fighting with the dead flowers saying this is mine, this is mine, they are dead flowers. When this happens to you, you will be amazed that you become automatically religious. I don't have to say don't and don't and don't. You become so powerful and you see everything so clearly that you give up everything that is wrong and destroyed. These outside religions have become like the dead flowers. And we are shocked how those people who profess this religion, who are in charge of these religions are doing such horrible things. But once you get your Self-realization the religion is born within you, become innate religious. You will be surprised to know that overnight people gave up drugs, alcoholism, all kinds of bad habits. Also they gave up fundamentalism because they realized that all religions say the same thing. So in Sahaja Yoga we worship Christ, we worship Krishna, as well as Mohammed Sahib. We worship, we just don't say that they are the same, we worship them the same way. No, no, no, I said just now you may get the realization. But the sprouting of the seed takes place when it has to go into a tree. That's what I said for a month. At the most. You see what I have to say first? There are com Kobe love or human beings have been exploiting them up. Like these false gurus from India are exploiting the western people also. So the, as you said it, I am very happy that you are anxious to have your Self Realization and you will get it today. I am very happy that you are anxious to have your Self Realization and you will get it today. That shows you are a real seeker of truth. Ah, there is one that I know that some people have been cured from serious diseases in sahaja yoga, is it true? It is, it is true, it is. I feel that there are many people in the whole state who have been cured from serious diseases in sahaja yoga. I see that. What is practically to do to get Self Realization? There is someone here who is injured from, he has a very severe avatar and he is very, very serious. We have here a senior who has had an attack on her vehicle that is so serious, and he has been continuously worried about her presentation. I am not sure about the people. Because they are so energy, they can't do it. We are practical. This is the practical thing. Yes. You should see for yourself, you see, don't believe everything. They are asking what are we practically to do to get Self Realization? You have to only unleash the desire to get Self Realization, that's all. I still used to say that man can be evolved. I understand the Shiva. Yes. He is not evaluated. He was. No, he said he can be evaluated by the way, how much he has in a way, he compels his ego, his own ego. So what is the meaning? Like to say, they are. So a man can be evaluated by the way, how much he has. Ego and compassion. Yes, you can evaluate everything. After Realization, your center sympathetic centers, you have seven, and on this side seven of them become enlightened. And they tell you what is wrong with you or what is wrong with others. The gentleman is asking that if you could Jesus said, Mohammed and Krishna in the same I mean in the same category, then why they different in totally different in some parts. Firstly according to time one has to work out everything according to time. Secondly all these books that Jesus about Jesus Bible to Mohammed also all these were written much later than they lived. And that is how they have tried to spoils the essence of their teachings. Now about fifty years back they discovered some papers in Egypt written by Thomas. One is very going to India, he lived them under a rock. The other thing is that many of the descriptions that were written by these prophets that were written by the Lord, they are studied and they are very much and the Lord is the most important one in the world. So they are not really in the way of manipulation. Last fifty years you see, they have been able to decode it now, library of Mohamadhi, you see, at Mohamadhi. And now it shows that what Bible, there are so many things that are missing in Bible and something that just not the truth. He has talked of experience of Self Realization and very much is Sahaja Yoga. Even Koran was written forty years after the death of Mohamad Sahib. He wrote in his ever new writing or in his ever new reading. So his revelation he told to his friends. After forty years they discovered that they were getting old. So they asked their children to learn reading and writing and then this Koran was written by these children. All these things we have explained about reincarnation, original sin, everything very clearly in Sahaja Yoga. Once you get to it you will be surprised that all this will be straightened out. All these things are being explained in Sahaja Yoga. The children will be able to see the same in Sahaja Yoga. How can one eradicate the spiritual sufferings which takes to self destruction? This idea of spiritual suffering is absolutely wrong. Why should you suffer? Christ has already suffered for us. We have to just awaken Him and He sucks in. If you see here these two things, one is on the right and one is on the left. One is the ego, another is the conditioning or super ego. So it is the ego in human beings, things that he has done right, wrong, he has done some karmas. These both are certain at this point, this crossing point if you see there, that's the place where Christ resides. And when this power which is in the triangular bone rises, passes through that center, Christ is awakened and He sucks Him. So that's your all karmas are sucked in. How much can we suffer? Can we suffer more than Christ? Is I can't understand. Once I say that Christ suffered for us and on the other side we start suffering or people start saying you must suffer for Christ's wife. You don't have to suffer. After all your Father, the God Almighty is the Father of all the fathers. Which father would like his son to suffer? I mean you make God unhappy when you suffer. It's logical. We don't have to suffer and I just can't understand. The insistent chapel you see Christ standing there and having the last judgment. And Michelangelo saw Him as he was and joined the Greek personality. He carried the cross. He could not be some miserable person. But on the table they put Christ like a some TB patient or I don't know what he looks like. I don't understand the psychology. Like when the beggars want to beg something they look very miserable in the same way they want to make Christ look miserable. How could he be miserable? So no scriptures are written. The difference is spiritual. Now the thing is I have had no gurus. I was born like this. But in the Vedanta is described. Specially Adi Shankaracharya has described very clearly about Kundalini. So many great poets from India have talked about Kundalini. They are absolutely supportive of Sahaja Yoga. But I think I could learn from them. I was born with this knowledge. I was born with this knowledge. I was born with this knowledge. This is all this Prana therapy and all these things. Prana is only on right side and that therapy never helps. So far I have not known anybody who got realization from all this. It is simple thing like this. See now this one instrument has got this chord. As simple as that. Now this instrument has to be connected to the mains. Unless and until it is connected it has no meaning. In the same way unless and until you are connected to this all-pervading power you have no meaning. And this connection is done by Kundalini. So there is no way out. Except for raising the Kundalini. And taking the fontanel bone area. So the Kundalini connects you to the all-pervading power. There is no therapy. There is no physical or mental or in any way there is no also people think that you should go on remembering something. It's not needed. For example now if you have a seed you put it in the Mother Earth. Now seed has the capacity to sprout. And the Mother Earth has got capacity to make it sprout. If you try to play about with the seed or if you try to say mantras, if you try to stand on your heads it's not going to sprout. It sprouts right so spontaneously such that it will be done. Now Anirudh said about developing of the Self. He said how can you speak about developing of the Self? The Self being a transcendent category it is eternal of course. But only thing is that once you get your Realization your awareness has to come. For example this belief remains the same. But say I am blind and I am opening my eyes. Then gradually I start seeing it, this place, all of you, then I go in another room, I see everything so I expand my awareness. It expands by itself also. But you have to become thoughtlessly aware through your meditation. For example we live in the future or the past. We cannot live in the present. So the thought from the past comes then from the future also comes and pass out. But in the center there is a little space, a pause. That is where is the present. So when Kundalini rises she elongates those thoughts and the space in between increases. So your attention now is in the present. So there is no thought. Present is reality. Thus you grow in reality. So very simple meditation you have to do. Every day about ten minutes and it works out. You have done everything in your last life. You have been seeking and seeking. Now this life you better have your Self-realization. You are asking for the life of the entire. This life is better than the Self-realization. He is asking for the nice question. Can we get our Self-realization tonight of course? We can get our Self-realization tonight of course. Very simple. That's it. I must say the questions were very very good and very truthful. But after getting realization you may feel really on top of the world. But it is not an individual happening. It is a collective happening. Say for example if my one nail is cut then it doesn't grow. One nail is cut then it doesn't grow. In the same way you have to be in the collective. Once week maybe at the most or once a month you all have to meet. You don't have to again pay for it. For all the knowledge you don't have to pay. No pogary. Can you believe that in My own other than we also say pogary for payment. All right. So one has to be just prepared in a very happy mood. Receive their Self-realization. This is the realization of the Self. Now only thing I would request you to take out your shoes and touch the Mother Earth and touch the ground. How? Put both feet away from it. So this is your own power, this is your own right. And once you get it, you will know how great you are. They might have already felt different washes. Now I have told you that the truth is that you are not this body, this mind. These emotions, intelligence but above all you are the Spirit. And another truth is that there is all pervading Divine Love, the power, as called as permachaitanya. And this power does all the living work. It organizes, it nourishes, it creates, it is the power of the Self. It organizes, it nourishes, it creates, it takes. But above all it loves. So now you have to put both your hands towards Me like this. Put both the feet away from each other and reach no further. If you don't bend too much or bend forward, just take. Now this all-pervading power you can feel as the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. Because Kundalini is the Holy Ghost reflected. So now please put your left hand towards Me. And put your right hand on your heart. This we have to do, just I want to tell you because later on you might be able to use this. Now here you close your eyes. You can take out your spectacles, please don't open your eyes till I tell you. Now here you ask a very fundamental question about yourself. You can ask Me, you can call Me Mother, Mother am I your Spirit? This is a question to be asked three times. If you become the Spirit you become your own master, your own guru. So now please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. We are working on the left hand side. Here you ask again a question, Mother am I my own master, am I my own guru? Ask this question three times. Now I cannot force pure knowledge on you, you have to ask first. So now please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. I am pressing. Here you have to say or ask six times because this center has got six pegs. So now please say six times, Mother please give me pure knowledge. As soon as you ask for pure knowledge the Kundalini starts rising. You won't feel anything but it is rising so we have to open the higher centers with our full confidence, self-confidence. Now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Now here you have to say ten times with full confidence in yourself, Mother I am my own master. Now raise your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. I have already told you that the truth is that you are the Spirit. You are not this body, this mind, these emotions but you are the pure Spirit. So now please raise your hand on your heart. I need full confidence. You have to say, Mother I am the pure heart. We say twelve times. I am the pure Spirit. There is one thing as I told you that you don't have to suffer. In the same way you don't have to feel guilty for anything. By feeling guilty you actually spoil your very important center which you call as left Vishuddhi. After all you are a human being, you are not God and if you have done mistakes it's alright. Because God is the ocean of compassion, of grace and of blessings. But above all He is the ocean of forgiveness. So please forgive yourself and don't feel guilty at all. Otherwise Kundalini will get stuck. So now please take your right hand in the left side of your shoulder, in the angle of your shoulder and your neck. I press it hard. Now here you have to say sixteen times with full confidence, Mother I am not guilty at all. Now next we'll have to forgive everyone. Some may say that it is very difficult to forgive. But if you forgive or don't forgive what do you do? You don't do anything. But when you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands. Those who have troubled you are happy and you are making yourself miserable. So you just forgive all of them and forget them and don't even think about them. Now please raise your right hand on your forehead across. Here you have to say from your heart not how many times, Mother I forgive everyone. Now please take your right hand on the back of your head and where you have to say. Without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes you have to say with full confidence. Just for your satisfaction. Oh Divine Power, if I have done anything wrong please forgive me. Say it from your heart, not how many times but say it from your heart. Now again I cannot force self-realization on you, you have to ask for it. So you have to put your right hand on top of your head on the fontanel bone area. Now you have to move your scalp slowly clockwise. Here again I cannot force self-realization on you. So please bend your head and move your scalp clockwise slowly saying several times, Mother please give me self-realization. Bend your head please. Now please take down your hand, open your eyes. Now put the left hand slowly towards me like this and put down your head. I see with the right hand if there's a cool breeze coming in. Maybe it might be hot but it will become cooler. Don't put your hand on top but away from it, somebody will get it far away. Now please put your right hand towards me. Now please bend your head and see for yourself if there's a cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. Now please put the left hand towards me and please put down your head. I see with the right hand if there's a cool breeze coming out of your head, maybe hot. Please bend your heads. Now please put both your hands across the sky like this, push back your head. Push back. I've asked a question, Mother is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? Or you can ask, Mother is this the All-Pervading Power of Divine Love? Or you can say, Mother is this the Param Chaitanya? Ask any one of these questions three times. Now please put down your hands. Now watch Me without thinking. Just watch Me without thinking. Put your hands towards Me. You'll feel something moving in your hands also. Also you'll feel there's no thought. Some will get, some may not, some very few will not get. All those who have felt cool or hot breeze in their hands or out of their heads, please raise both your hands. All of you practically except for one or two, may God bless you all. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Hello, this is a very wonderful song I think because it describes actually the breaking of the Sahastrara. Anahata means the heart, you know, anahat chakra is heart chakra. And on the head here is also the heart chakra. So it says that, you have broken My heart, chakra. How clearly this is? I don't know how these people know, I mean, because I got a little bit. It's a fact. This is anahata chakra hai, ani thi thi thi chakra, that's a peat hith hai. Anahata chakra is a peat hith hai. Kavdi kasab borob burmat le le. And then there is a sound that comes up, you know, it's throbbing. So he said that that throbbing I heard. So clear cut is this, I just don't know. These Maharashtrians know about it very well, I think. Deshpande kone? He kana tum hai, ai thi hai, nahi the hai nahi le le. Te shivadas swami manohunge le. Kona? Shivadas. Ah, te spi wat. There is one gentleman called shivadas swami. He must be a realized soul, so he is. Oh, the devise bhakta. The exact one. Aicha bhakta vadhi dho. Anahata man jai, anahata rudha hai chakra laa, anahata matthaa. Ani ithe peat hai, anahata. Chhaya. Tati borob burmat le le, kya bhi moti lokota aple marashta. Great. Kootle te? Te yala aple mahur lau te. Mahur. Mahur che hai, achha. Where the Mahaswara Shri's temple is there called Renuka Devi, he was there. So see how clearly he said it. Bhi matla achkaal modern lo ka na kupna kalda hai. Nahi, nahi. Bhad bhi freya hai. Par matla gam aa, nahi aati hushte hai. Anath chakrat sah. Ura vyad. Vahavaya. Vahavaya. Vahavaya.

We have here a very great, honorable, prestigious guest. His name is Varnav Yury Alexanderovich. He's the President of the Academy of Arts in Diningrad and a very enlightened soul. He has been very kind to Sahaja Yoga and to Me. He's such a learned man in art and still so humble. I understand Divine art but not the human art so much. I understand the Divine art but not the human art so much. I understand the Divine art but not the human art so much. Now I must correct Myself because I thought He must be of the art but He is of the science. I, misunderstanding comes from the sensitivity which He has, which normally scientists don't have. And as it is I was telling you that I understand the Divine science but human science is very bifurcated, bifurcated, is very much. It is really very gratifying for all of us to know that in the area of science there are people of His quality who can become so subtle to understand Sahaja Yoga. I wish Him a very long life and all the blessings of the world. I am told He... Vidheem is also his colleague from the same academy. You must now be all very happy that we have such a great personality. I am told that there is a great personality in Sahaja Yoga who will look after your interests, who will protect you and your peace. I feel extremely satisfied and overjoyed. On behalf of all the Sahaja Yogis of the world I would like to assure you, sir, that you will be always supported and will be regarded as the father of these children so that you can look after them. We hope you will be coming to our seminars in Italy in Kabela whenever we request you. Also we would very be happy to have your colleague with you. I am sure after seeing him all your insecurities have dissolved, insecurities have been dissolved. He is a very wise gentleman and I am sure he will always guide you in proper lines. Dear our citizens, dear foreigners, foreign guests, and great Shri Mataji, it is not only a significance for us here but for both our great countries. This document was concurred with by all the Presidium of the Petrovsk Academy of Sciences and Arts. It is my honor to present to you the President of the United States of America, the President of the United States of America, the President of the United States of America, the President of the United States of America, the President of the United States of America, the President of the United States of America, the President of the United States of America, the President of the United States of America, the President of the United States of America, the President of the United States of America, the President of the United States of America, the President of the United States of America, the President of the United States of America, the President of the United States of America, this is Nirmala Shrivastava, who understands and rules with the basic questions of religion, philosophy and science. Tirelessly she's doing noble work directed towards the goodness and friendship of nations, of the nations of India and Russia and all the world, who has seen in our country the center of the world of world spirituality and morality. The center of bringing together East and West, the center of the revival of high moral principles, which lights Russia's face, lights the faces of the many countries included in Russia. Under the leadership of the Russian people, being the founder of this moral teachings of Sahaja Yoga, Mrs. Nirmala Shrivastava really fundamentally joins the psychophysiological processes, the physical and psychological health of people and their style of living and morality. The Presidium of the Petrovskie Akademie of Arts and Sciences recognizes their pleasant duty to hear with, let you know, to let the leading daughter of the great Indian people and her... and they have voted you to be an honorary member of the Akademie. I'm really very much thankful to you, sir, for considering Me for this kind of great award. Luckily we have many enlightened scientists in Sahaja Yoga and also great artists who have been able to expose many things about the metascience and they have scientifically proved it. So you are the first person of this level who has recognized that there is a science beyond the science. Also there is art beyond art. And there is religion beyond religions. Now the science beyond the science gives you the secrets which are not yet discovered by science, which I will discuss with you later. I'll tell you what things have happened. And nothing is a mystery. Same with medical science. Now how do you know that this art is good and relevant and another is not? Whatever is constructive and whatever is destructive. When you reach the state of selfhood, of enlightenment, then you can feel the absolute truth on your fingertips as vibrations. So when you look at any art piece or artistic creation, it emits vibrations. Because it is made by a great realized soul. Like in your Armitage, you have twenty-six beautiful paintings of Ramarans. In the Armitage, in Dendelion, in Gita's birth, there are twenty-six beautiful paintings of Ramarans. I came specially to see them, long time back. They all have vibrations. And he has used very few colors, very few colors. But tremendous vibrations. So you can make out which is real art, which is not. Because now it is becoming sort of a commercial commodity. Art has become a commercial commodity. But not joy-giving. So in all these three areas of human endeavor, we find with enlightenment you get to the point where everything that is destructive just is negated. Wherever there is purity, there is joy. Also there is emancipation. You only enjoy that science, that art, and also that religion. The same with music that suits you, makes you peaceful and compassionate. This is the universal happening. Now see these people, nobody knows Indian languages, but how they enjoyed Indian music. Because Indian music actually comes from Divine. In the same way, many of your classical music, like Mozart, also come from the Divine. So now we reach a state of a new awareness where we understand whatever is righteous, whatever is beautiful, whatever is pure, and we enjoy those virtues. Thank you very much. I would also request the colleagues from the same academy to say a few words to us. Thank you. Thank you very much. Russia. We are very proud of the people who have supported us. We are very proud of our country and we are very proud of our country. I would like to say that Russia is not a place of justice. It is a place of love and love. I am very proud of the people who have supported us. I would like to say that Russia is not a place of justice. Russia is not a place of justice. I would like to say that Russia is a place of love and love. And it is an important and important effort to make such a donation good, toaring with the corruption of the Russian agents and the Russian academy, state of the State ofKor combinations. It is very difficult translate in English. So thank you very much for this honor bestowed upon me. Also, there's another area of art which combines all these three, is the drama. And today the French have decided to give a beautiful display of a drama which was actually written in New Zealand. It is little sensitive area where we touch, I hope you wouldn't mind. It's about how our Lord Jesus Christ was absolutely misrepresented by Paul, because Paul was a bureaucrat. This is not against Catholicism, but is against, not against explaining why certain things were put there by Paul. First of all, he was a bureaucrat and he thought this was a nice chance to jump on the stage to take over. And he found out the weakest disciple of Christ was Peter. Christ has said, as Satan will follow you. Christ has said that to Peter that a Satan will get you. Now this Paul, when I was quite young, I asked my father, because I was born in a Christian family, who is this Paul? So he said he's a squatter, squatter. Also then he killed many real Christians who were Gnostics, who were knowledgeable like you are. He killed them and he also killed one disciple of Christ called Stephen. Stephen, Stephen. He was the hater of women. Even the Mother of Christ, he called her as a woman in the Bible, as a woman. She was not a woman. She was Mahalakshmi. Now, he missed the point completely that he was doing such a harm by hating women that way. As a result, women were not respected in all the Christian relations. Jews respected the Primordial Mother, Greeks respected Athena, India they respected Adi Shakti. Even in Koran, Mohammed Sahib has said, nobody should say a word against the chastity of the Holy Mother of Christ. This is the reason women became very insecure in the Christian nations, extremely insecure. Up till now there was a quarrel going on in England, supposed to be a developed country, whether a woman should be a priest or not. While in India, woman is a shakti, is the power. So spiritually, I think, it's very primitive idea, it's a very primitive idea. That's why I think in the West, women don't care so much for their chastity. All the time they have to be attractive to men and to be pampering their ego. Because woman as a mother is not respected. Whatever one may try, it's an innate feeling, so they call Christ's Mother as Madonna. It is not in the Bible. It is people out of their love for the Mother. That is how, you see, a great harm has been done. There is a saying in Sanskrit that, yatra narya pujante, yatra ramante devata, meaning where the women are respectable and respected, there where the gods reside. So this is the power of love of Mother. And there are so many other things which He introduced in the Bible. He edited the Bible. He fought with Matthews on immaculate conception and Thomas ran away to India. John also didn't want to write anything. His friend wrote for him. John didn't want to write. His friend wrote for him. John, say it again. So the, still the truth is there, such a lot in the Bible that they could not erase it out, thanks to the power of Christ. So this drama is about how Paul tried to capture the platform. I hope you all enjoy it. Thank you. Thank you. The name of the drama is The Saints and Mr. Paul. Please stand up. He is an Australian but now living in New Zealand. He is a well known writer. He is a great writer. He is a great writer. He is a great writer. He is a great writer. He is a great writer. He is a great writer. He is a great writer. He is a great writer. He is a great writer. He is a great writer. He is a great writer. He is a great writer. He is a great writer. He is a great writer. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. This is a story about the Apostle Paul, the great apostle of the Holy Ghost of Christ, and the great mystery of Paul. He learns that Paul has arrived in Jerusalem. This worries him. But his counselor explains that Paul helped in the death of Saint Stephen. He is an ally. He is also a good administrator. He should be encouraged. Later, Saint Peter reveals to Saint John that Paul makes him nervous. He reveals him not to worry. Paul arrives full of anger. Paul reminds Peter that they have a contract. Peter, John, and James take charge of things in Jerusalem, while he, Paul, converts the rest of the world. Paul accuses Peter of breaking this contract by sending people to Antioch to turn the local Christians into Jews. Martha and Mary Magdalena arrive with James. They tell Paul of the many beautiful things that have happened to them over the years, especially being twice born at the Pentecost. Paul has a fit. In the last scene, Paul tempts Peter by naming him the rock on which he says Christ will build his church. Slowly and cleverly, Paul wins Peter over. John, however, realizes how desperate the situation is. Here we are in Jerusalem, 50 years after the birth on earth of the son of the Adishakti, Lord Jesus Christ. Having the land of the Jews under his control, the governor and his counselor are getting bored in their marble palace. Your Excellency, Your Excellency, Your Excellency, a dangerous man has arrived in Jerusalem. Really? Paul, the madman, the one who says we have to seek suffering and punish the flesh till it surrenders. He is dangerous. He fell from his horse on the road to Damascus and now he thinks he is a prophet. True. But he helped us. He was responsible for the death of Stephen who was spreading the law of Jesus Christ everywhere. But also, people, many listen to his speeches. They are fascinated by him. Do not worry. He dominates them, makes slaves out of them. What should we fear out of slaves? You are right. John and James threaten our world with their love. What we need is not love. It is Roman discipline and administration. Paul also is creating an administration and he may one day reinforce us. True. True. Soldier, you understand? Nobody should touch him. Let him be free to do his work. Our work. Peter is waiting for Paul to come. He is worried as he doesn't have much faith in himself. Could we have light, please? I have to stay calm. I have to keep cool. It will be no use if I lose my temper. But I will be careful if he tries any of his tricks. Good evening, Peter. So is he here? No. Oh. He will be very soon. John. Yes. If I will argue with Paul, you will help me, won't you? Oh, Peter. You are the one with the brain. I'd sooner talk to a Roman legend. At least with the enemy, you know where you are. He's at the corner. He's coming. Is he alone? He works very fast. Can I go to the kitchen? He won't bite you. He's not a snake. Maybe still. I'd rather stay in the kitchen. God, our Father, we venerate you. Holy Spirit, our Mother, we know you. Jesus, the Son, we adore you. Please grant us the cool wind. Give us the love that blows cool. God, gracious, oh, God, Lord, Lord. Ah. Ah. Paul, we wish you peace and joy. I don't know too much about joy. It's not peace I want. It's bloody war. You don't change, do you? So, that's where you meet. Yes. People will come tonight for the prayers and the songs. Who does the plans for these meetings? Plans? We don't have too much planning. People just bring up what they want. Like? Oh, distribution of food to those who need help. How many successes we have had. How many baptisms last week, marriage, birth. You don't keep lists? Only in our heads. I have lists from every town I've been to. Andrew says too much organizing gets in the way. Of what? The divine will. Who will come tonight to the meeting? Most of us, the master chose, are in town. His brother James, of course. Rebecca, Thomas, Matthew, Joseph, Andrew, Martha, and Maria Magdalena. You have women at these meetings? All the best ideas come from women. But you don't let them vote. Anyone can vote if they want to. Why did you break our contract? Contract? We shook hands on it. You would stay here in Jerusalem and preach to the Jews. I would go elsewhere and preach to the others. I haven't broken any contract. You have? I have not. You have so? No. That's three times you've denied it. Cucurico! Who did you know about that? It was 20 years ago. Eighteen. Don't you feel any guilt? Remorse. Here come James, Martha, and Mary Magdalene, who are loving, pure in heart, and who are dearly loved by Jesus Christ. Don't you feel any guilt? I suppose I did at the time, but not anymore. Next day was his death. That was what changed you, wasn't it? Admitted Peter, the crucifixion was a big turning point. Not at all. The world collapsed. We are all empty inside. We could feel better than ever our longing for God. But when the resurrection came... Ah, and the great Pentecost. That was different matter. Nothing has been the same since then. Nothing. Pentecost! What did Pentecost have to do with it? Surely you know about it. You've been teaching, you've been converting people to the teachings of our Lord for five years now, and you don't know about being twice born? Twice born? What is that nonsense? Do you know what he's talking about? It was our beginning of being. Our big turning point. The enlightening of the light. Ah, yes. The night our Lord was arrested, he told us to wait in Jerusalem. He said the Spirit will blossom within us. We have no idea what he said, but we waited, like he said. And it happened. At Pentecost we were at Mary's place. Suddenly these cool winds swept through the house. In fact, it swept through each one of us. There was an incredible peace. No worries, no thoughts, nothing. Just joy. We went outside. Hundreds of people were standing there, watching us. We had this flame, this clear flame coming out of the top of our heads. Ah, yes. We were laughing, singing. Philippe and Bartolomeu were dancing. The crowd thought we were drunk at nine o'clock in the morning. The night our Lord was arrested, he told us to wait in Jerusalem. He said the Spirit will blossom within us. Ah, yes. Ah, yes. Oh, my, I was in your field of the night. I was in your field of the night. I was in your field of the night. I was in your field of the night. Oh, my, I was in your field of the night. I was in your field of the night. I was in your field of the night.

I heard about something like that a long time ago but this is not the point. The turning point is not getting yourself born all over again. It's Christ's death. Nothing in the world is more important than Christ's death. Even his life wasn't that important. But his death for our sins. It was the eternal sacrifice for all mankind. But wouldn't you say new life is just as important? Even more important than death? Even his death? No, I would not. But back to the point who Peter said he didn't break the contract. Then who sent Nicholas to Antioch? Martha is a wise woman, always very active. She is not afraid of Paul. No individual did. What's this? Nonsense! Our Lord Jesus washed our feet. He told us we should do the same. So explain. Sending Nicholas to Antioch caused Shaios and Antioch in a city of immoral lunatics. But I talked to them about the Christ and many were baptized. They called themselves Christians. Christians? Christians? Yes, sir, I organized the Christians. Christ was very pleased he told me. He told you? Yes. But Nicholas frightened them away talking about the law of Moses and about Israel. Listen Paul, in this book we have written down every word we can remember Jesus saying. Do not take the road to any non-Jewish land. Go only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. You are all against me. You're jealous of my success. The Greeks and the Romans you converted against the command of God. So we must teach them the virtues we apply that Moses taught to all the Jews. That is why we sent Nicholas to Antioch. And Martha will teach these Christians in Cyprus. And John will teach the Christians in Ephesus. You can try but you won't succeed. It's not the cool wind that will work it out. It's miracles. In Cyprus a Jew was mocking me while I was talking about Christ's death. I felt the anger rise in me. I raised my hand toward him. Next minute he was blind. Many Romans asked for their baptism after that. You blind the Jew, one of your brothers. Blinding people is not miracles. It's witchcraft. Remember you baptized the Roman soldier Cornelius and his family. Why not baptize other pagans? Cornelius was seeking God. He had studied the Lord of Moses and had purified himself. He was truly ready. But all of humanity has to be crucified with our Lord. They have to go to the tomb with him and share his resurrection. Our Lord told us the Jews must lead the way. We must establish first those who are ready for second birth. So you say Jesus did not tell me that. People need simple clear-cut instructions so they can follow Christ and his organisation. It's more than words and organisation Paul, much more. More what? It's what happens inside. It's peace. It's joy. It's oneness with the Spirit. It's adoration over the Lord. It's the holy breeze. Have you ever felt a kind of coolness inside you? Not long after the great Pentecost I was at the market. There was a huge crowd. I was hot, feverish, angry, full of duds. Then I went to Mary's place. Did you meet his mother before she left? Well, no. She is the mother of all mothers. Generous, loving and yet powerful. Well, when I arrived at her place, the anger left me. She told me to put my hand over my head and I felt this coolness coming out. First a flame, now a cool wind. And who cares about Mary, that woman, anyway? I see Christ every day. You see Jesus? Yes, standing there. Sad, short and incredibly thin. Jesus, sad and thin. Short? He was bigger and stronger than me. Every day I see Christ. He tells me words of truth. Those who enjoy life must learn there is nothing to laugh about. It is better for an unmarried man to stay unmarried. Christians must confess their sins to a priest. Since only a priest can forgive, every Christian must suffer. These words could never come from our Lord. He told us to enjoy life. He blessed marriage. Every man, he said, should have a wife, for she is the source of man's strength. Forgive, he said, not confess. My God, what was it you saw on the road to Damascus? A sad little demon telling you to stop persecuting the devotees and join them? Why? So, you could do even more damage to the collective from the inside. Yes, Lord. I listen. I must go. Yes, proclaim your words everywhere. I understand, but they don't understand the great plan. Of course. Peter, I shall, my Lord. I shall, my Lord. Okay. Paul lost consciousness for three hours. The doctor came. He said it was epilepsy, but that he would recover. Wait, wait, stay. I always have a bad taste in my mouth when I wake up. People say I always look very sick. Come on, sit down. It's him. Yes, there. That's the problem. I used to have a headaches too, but since that twin blew through us, I haven't had it run. Andrew had a big pain in the back. Here, but not after Pentecost. You know, my dear Peter, people like your openness and enthusiasm. And it's not me who tells, and it's not just me who says so. Just a few hours back, Jesus talked to me. He said, Peter is the rock on which I shall build my church. He says that? Really? Yes, he wants us together, you and I. So, here we are. The new team. The new team. Spreading light into every dark corner of the globe. The new team. Paul, laying the foundations on Peter the rock, spreading light into every dark corner of the globe. You are serious about him calling me his rock? Oh yes. Imagine what it would be like if the whole Roman Empire was to be Christian. From Britain to Egypt, from Spaniards to Persians, from Caesar to slaves. He doesn't want Rome. You and I together, if we put our minds to it, we could give Rome Christ and Christ Rome. Romans? They murdered our master. I hated them even before they murdered Jesus. Did I? He doesn't want Rome. Did he say so specifically? Do not take the road to any non-Jewish land. Romans are superb administrators. Just think, Rome and Christ ruled by one single administrative spiritual force. Romans? They murdered our master. I hated them even before they murdered Jesus. No. You are wrong. The Jews killed him. The Jews? What are you talking about? To Jews, Christ was a real danger. He was a problem for rich businessmen. Even he whipped the shopkeepers in the temple. So the Jews wanted to get rid of him. So they called the Romans. Finally the Romans, under pressure, reluctantly, honestly, carefully, sentenced him to death. But it was the Jews. I saw it. I was here when he was arrested. By the Romans. I was at his trial. By the Romans. He was crucified. By the Romans. If Jews had wanted him dead, they could have killed him easily. Paul, what nonsense are you talking about? Well, well, well, well. You know, the Romans won't come into our organization if we tell them they killed Christ. So that's it. You want to change the story to build a big empire in the name of Christ. He didn't talk about converting Rome. The only empire he would talk about was the empire of God chosen. It wasn't power, authority, and force he talked about. It was wisdom, forgiveness, and gentleness. Sapietiam leporum veniamque. Don't stop. Your words in the universal language will last forever. It wasn't revenge that he told us. It was... Refere. Refere non doque. It was forgiveness and full-heartedness. Sei dignos rei et alias amare. He said we should be detached from everything. Families. Familias excuteri. Materialism. Co poris compendum excuteri. Power. Protestatum excuteri. Until only the spirits remence. Dum spiritus solus maniat. With its compassion and dedication. Com misericodia sua. And its peace. Et cum pache sua. You see, we make a good team. You will be the leader. I am an organiser. Christ tells me what to do. I arrange everything. But thousands of them will come to listen to you. Every word they say, every word you say, they take for granted. Even if they don't understand a single word, they still have confidence in you. Romans are ready for Christ. They feel responsible for massacres, ashamed, guilty. They are ripe for picking, waiting for us. We only have to baptise a few important people in Rome and the Christianity will be the law. Peter! Peter! Don't listen to him! What's this? Our Lord spent his lifetime freeing us from our past. And this horrible man is going to bind us again with new chains. I see what you're up to. You want a big organisation which can be challenged by anyone? Exactly. A priest in every town. Everybody will have to listen to what the voice is telling me. I pity the poor soul who tries to approach our dear Lord in his own way. Unity is essential. Those who preach a gospel that is not mine, yes, should be condemned to hell. Religions failed in the past because they had no roots, no structure, no system, no order. That will not happen to Christianity. It must be structured, organised, strong with the power to forgive sins, with the power to excommunicate the power of heaven and hell for us. O Comforter! O Consellor! O Teacher of all things! God, our Mother! Adored One, we bow to you. Please, come back from India.

And I went to his program and immediately recognized Me. Better translate to that. Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. And he came forward, bowed before Me and he said, Mother, please come and sit before Me. I want to sing in your praise. He is a Sufi who believe in all the religions and our Sahaja Yogis. And we have had very great Sufis in our India who has written lots of kawalis of this kind in praise of God and also they have sung songs to Shri Rama and Shri Krishna. Last time when My birthday was celebrated, it was very near the Madhava is the grave, the holy grave of Rizamuddin Khazam. He, Hazrat Rizamuddin, he was a great Sufi in India. He was a great Sufi in India. He was a great Sufi in India. And I told Sahaja Yogis that I was the first to put a garland of, or a sheet of flowers on his grave long time back. So all the Sahaja Yogis went down to put the chadar, to put the chadar is the flower sheet. So the head of that organization came to our program, who garlanded Me and gave Me a beautiful shawl. And he bowed to Me. Also in Turkey. The Sufis came down, they got their realization and they bowed to Me. They are all Muslims. Also in France, the head of the Shia community is called as Ayatollah Ruhani. Ayatollah Ruhani. He is one of the four Ayatollahs now living. One of the four Ayatollahs who are living. And he very humbly came to our ashram and to our program and he was extremely happy that he got his realization. And he said, this is My resurrection, kiyama. And in the Koran is written that twelfth Mahadi will give resurrection. So he asked Me a question, Mother, are you the twelfth Mahadi? I didn't say anything to him, but I think he knows. I didn't answer him. So there are people in every country who are seeking their resurrection. Another mistake Paul has committed in the Bible, that those who are in the grave will come out of the graves. And then they will be resurrected. Now imagine in the graves what is there left is nothing but few bones. But according to Sahaj, many people will be born in this special time of judgment and they will get their resurrection. Their souls will be reborn. That's why we have population problem also. It's a special, very special time described even in Indian scriptures. Long time back, thousands of years back. So you are the people who are those great souls who were seeking God in your last lives and now you have found the truth. We have had no music from Polish people so they want to give some music program and after that also Romanians and Bulgarians want to give song. I must say it's remarkable how they can sing Indian songs so well. It's a miracle because you see the western people or you people never knew even to pronounce one word of Sanskrit or of Indian language. And now I find they not only sing but they understand and know everything. It's very remarkable. Tonight is the day when we keep awake in Diwali. So you shouldn't mind if there is time. It's the night to be kept awake. Today is the day when we keep awake in the slavas. It's very important because we are not going to be able to speak in the slavas of the Indian language or Sanskrit. Did you say tonight is one has to keep awake? Yes, the night when we keep awake. Give a big Shri Mataji. This is Polish. To Him you can translate. Translate. Translate. Before singing. This is the day when we keep awake in the slavas of the Indian language or in the slavas of the Indian language. It's very important. It's very important.

The song which was sung just now was dealing with the love of Shrimata ji, the indiscriminating love of Shrimata ji, where she has not discriminated between even Ram and Ravana. She would have loved both of them equally. Ram and Ravana. According to the poet her love is even superior to the conquering of Ravana or even the teachings of Christ where he has said that hate the sinner and not the sinner. So I have gone on to say that because of love you can transform the sinner to be a holy man. The song that is to follow is a duet which is describing about the qualities of the eyes of Shrimata ji. It is such a difficult subject but the poet has made an effort and has admitted that her eyes are beyond comparison. This is a very difficult subject but the poet's words are very clear and clear. I have seen that in the past and in the past I have seen that in the past I have seen that I have seen nothing. The eyes which are so serene, which are so deep, which are so benevolent, which are so kind and which have all the qualities. So we should surrender to these qualities of the eyes if we want to have our ascent. It will be a duet sung by Anil and Sureka. A little louder on number eight. There are two white horses. Recently they have enlarged the eyes of Shrimata ji and on the pupil of the eye there were two horses. But according to the poet, what about horses? The whole universe is drowned in her eyes. The white horse is symbolizing the Kalaki of Thar. The Kalaki of the white horse symbolizes the Kalaki of Thar. There is a mention about these white horses in the Bible also. I will ask you to clap a little later. This is a very serene song dealing with very deep subjects of the eyes of Shrimata ji. So we will listen quietly. A little louder on number eight, please. And don't disturb. So so so so so so definitely clap on this number eight please and do not disturb once you have fixed let it remain number eight a little louder little louder hello ah is I See Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Oh Me Oh Oh Oh Oh The second Shri Mataji with your permission absolutely brand-new song which even Guido has not heard before Can you come can you come here and translate These are the random jottings Shri Mataji as you inspired me to write First I will recite in Hindi Koi in Samile hawa jap chale vibrations Koi in Samile in Samile hawa jap chale Kona apna hai tabhata to chili Shaher ho gaho ya ghar ho apna Shaher ho gaho ya ghar ho apna apna pange hate to a gay chili Koi in Samile Ham hai banjari is sehirami Ham hai banjari is sehirami Suni Koi pyaar ki Sadatoham chili Last a sub se kulke milo o belo sahib Sub se kulke milo o belo sahib ap kya chis hai ye pata to chele Now in English It's the first answer is if you meet a Human being or a person or a seeker when the vibrations are flowing then you would know To which side he is you would know whether he's a person who is genuinely seeking or not because he would be hit by the vibrations Kya rahe la chila yaka ishi shiva yavale a it's a vohchi varshney muznati gyo nakhu it's an aca question Yeah, yes, you know you some of the lee shit is Jim Second standard is Shaher ho gaho ya ghar ho apna Apna ye apna apna pange hate to a gay chili. There is a lot of attachment Like we say it is our country it is our Town it is our village. It is our house. These are our various attachments and these attachments abstract your growth Nasty is to achieve logo previous mistakes. We're next way. We don't Procreate which the way sim here 80 previous must see the middle of Nash roast so when you remove these Obstructions of attachment then only you can grow that is the conclusion drawn By the mostly talk a list of the beauty it is prepared to be taught at the nation You know the washing wash roast no, it's a new year Then I have compared ourselves the Sahaja Yogis with the nomadic because we have Got out of all our attachments and we have a beyond the attachment. So we are called the banjara that the nomadic and We are in this this world, which is like a desert which offers nothing else but illusion with a Miriam in a hood in second Pustina Katara of lights and a shame in him cacto Caliph illusion and Because we are nomadic a a Shout or a cry or a little voice of Beckoning you for love you would be motivated and you would move to help them like I was Shri Mataji always says that the Germans were motivated to come and help the Russians when they wanted to start Sahaja Yoga activity in Russia Yes, ma'am.

Today we are a little tired. Therefore, now we are going on to Bhairavi. We are going to perform a song called, Kavali. We will play it. The song is, Rendering is a favorite of Shri Mataji. The song deals with the body and the soul, relationship of the body with the soul. The soul is described as the husband and the body is described as the wife. The body is left without the soul as though the wife has been left without the soul. And the body is left without the soul as though the wife has been left by her husband. And the wife is complaining that without any cause or reason the husband has left. And the husband had so many ways of escaping. I do not know how he has escaped. The song has been written by the daughter of Kabir, Kamali. In the end she says, it is much better to live as a maiden than to be married and be deserted like this.

We have to be thankful to these musicians who have come all the way from India. They have just come to celebrate the Diwali with you all and you have seen with what enthusiasm they have been entertaining you. Now the last song was little bit not correctly translated. It's a Kabira song and very symbolic, which he says that, Sanya is the life. Kabira being the Saint Michael by Ramanatha has always sung the songs of death. How he has overcome the death? He just shows that death is nothing. Can you tell them? Have you got it? That's better. That's better. He is saying that Sanya is life and when life went away, when he died, means he died, he says, I didn't fight with death. People fight with death, I reconcile. You see, this is very symbolic. Many people misunderstand him because he is very deep and symbolic. Then the second thing he is saying that you ask my friend. This is Kabira's daughter Kamal who is singing. You ask my friend what I did. What I did. So she says that I was lying on the bed covered with a sheet. I was lying on the bed covered with a sheet, like a dead body. So he is telling how when the death comes, how a realized soul acts. Then he says there are ten doors to this body which is enjoying everything, Ranga Mahal, where the body enjoys everything. There are ten doors. For normal human beings there are only nine doors, but for realized souls there are ten doors. One more in the Sahastrara. So she says that I don't know which window was opened through which my lover, that is the life, went away. So, his description about life is that he is like a Beloved, but he went away. I didn't fight as normally women would fight if some husband leaves her or any Beloved. Then at the end she says, she is the daughter of Kabira. Kamal is the daughter of Kabira. So she said, this life which came to Me and went away. So I was actually became married to this life is better that I should have remained a virgin without having life would have been much better. That is the description. So it is not that she left her husband or anything, but her husband or her Beloved was life. So this is how he has made it into such a beautiful romantic poem, I think out of death. That's typical of Kabira. He is such a great poet on death. How to look at death, how to witness death and how it works out is done by Kabira. He is, if you see from this angle you will understand all his poetry which appears to be very sometimes superficial and also sometimes not so spiritual. But it is extremely symbolic because he was also a great, great incarnation. So, may God bless you. For tomorrow we have a program about, there is a custom in India where we put a kind of a turmeric powder mixed with some scented things to the faces of the brides and the bridegroom. Unfortunately men don't understand anything in India about all these things. So they brought this turmeric powder from the machine. Indian men are absolutely ignorant about all these things. So I don't know, it might little bit burn your skin. Actually not burn but might get a burning sensation. It is meant to make you look more brighter and fairer. You are all very fair but still. So this ceremony can start at four o'clock. Once it will be applied to the ladies, to the brides and then to the bridegroom. And it is actually played just like holy that they have. We apply in joy. But be careful. I don't want you to have burning feelings. All right. After that you all, the bride and bridegroom, everybody has to have a bath or clean yourselves and be ready for the wedding. We could have about six o'clock. I'll have to see the girls first and then the boys. And that's how the wedding will take place. They all know about it. But one thing is not yet done which is very important to find out for the bride, a father and a mother. Also for the bridesmaid and one brother. And the brother for the bride. And for the boy also for the bridegroom, you have to find out a father and a mother. And a uncle, mama. So now you have to dominate tomorrow, the bride and the bridegroom have to dominate both would be their relations for the marriage. I wanted to have a western style marriage but they said they want to have Indian style. It's quite complicated. Or cement. But then it will burn. Try first and see. I think you have to put some glass and then some sand. Now there are so many marriages. There are about now I think about ninety marriages. And all the Eastern Bloc and Russian girls have to come in their national dresses and also the same for the bridegrooms. So the brides and bridegrooms have to come, national dresses. But I think all the Europeans and Americans have bought saris. There are some more left I think, those who want to buy. And the four, you have settled just now the wages. All right, there are only four left so if there are some new brides they should buy from the West. I think it will all work out. The whole thing takes hardly one hour. But you have to be very careful because we have to use fire and there are carpets here. It will be nice if you all can bring one glass sheet or something like a stone. So I hope you'll all enjoy a new style of weddings. Some of you know of them and it will all work out. And after that we'll have dinner. First the bride, bridegroom will have dinner in a particular way and after that you all have your dinner. And then we settle down for very good classical music. Thank you. So now you give a hand to all these musicians who have come from India.

Can I take a picture with this light? Can I take a picture with this light? This is a series of photographs that will begin to show you some of the things that we've discussed tonight. These beginning pictures are just informal pictures that you should be able to do. As I mentioned to you earlier, this is a series of photographs that we've discussed tonight. This is a series of photographs that we've discussed tonight. This is a series of photographs that we've discussed tonight. This is a series of photographs that we've discussed tonight. This is a series of photographs that we've discussed tonight. This is a series of photographs that we've discussed tonight. In this picture you can see the light spreading a lot more prominently. In this photograph, in a program, light surrounds Shrimadaji. These are these vibrations, the Param Chaitanya, in Sanskrit, that flow through everything that can be admitted by a person who has their Self-realization. In Shrimadaji, this power is very well established, and therefore you see it expressing itself. We were having a Christmas celebrations and then these photographers took a thought shift there that photograph is very clear and suddenly, the white presence appeared in the middle now in this form on the left hand side. It's clear, it's not clear. So I have asked them to make a proper film out of it. There, all these ladies appear at different pudas, whenever we have. We have a photograph here. I'm trying to get that to work. That's a short video. So I think that we may want to put it back. Shrimadaji is giving not only programs in large cities like Seattle, but it's traveling through villages in developing countries as this photograph in India, to programs where seven, eight, ten thousand people attend and all give this experience that we're describing to you tonight. And suddenly, they will do this on the side. This is the photograph of Shrimadaji in a program where the camera recorded almost slowly these vibrations. Same on the left, on the top, and this is on the side. Also on the card. In this photograph, you can see light emitting from Shrimadaji's Agnya Chakra. It's not a reflection because her arm is out of the window, the window is down, and these vibrations are expressing themselves. The camera was able to capture that. This photograph is described as the many hands of Yavishakti, the Goddess. In this photograph, Shrimadaji is a program in India, her left hand is on her lap and open, the right hand is being held up to the audience like this, and from that hand is being emitted these vibrations that we spoke of in a tremendously concentrated form. It just becomes light. In this photograph, you see that emanating from Shrimadaji's head, the top of the head, just creating light which the camera was able to record. This photograph is the same, the whole photograph is these vibrations. This part of the Chaitanya you can just barely, pardon? I have the Saffiya, I have the Vyaya. Only the crown is remaining at the top of the head. The rest is just light. Again, this is vibrations all around Shrimadaji's entire body. Only the right hand is remaining in the photograph. You can see it being held up, and everything else is just light in vibrations. Vibrations here are completely filling the photograph, so the image of Shrimadaji herself is obscured by the energy. In this photograph, this is very dynamic. One of the things that as we progress in Sahaja Yoga, we begin to establish is that each of these centers within us correspond, have a corresponding deity or aspect of the Divine that helped to establish them. At the lowest center, the corresponding aspect is called Shriganesha, who is a deity from the Hindu religion. He is described as a very innocent and wise boy that has the head of an elephant. You can see in the photograph that appearing before Shrimadaji is this image of two eyes at the top of the photograph, and a very subtle outline on the trunk appearing before or during the function. This is Shriganesha. In this series of pictures, which were taken over a fair period of time, you will see light coming down from the sky, and rays shining upon Shrimadaji on a relatively cloudy day. This is taken from different angles at different times of the day, so that these rays couldn't be created by just a chance. A very small village in India. And they are appearing in the entire series. This is a program, I believe it's in India, from one angle where thousands of people have come to get the experience of Self-realization, and they're all holding up their hands to acknowledge that they have in fact felt that energy. This is from another angle on your hands. See the light. The light of the Kundalini, which I described earlier, is expressing itself in this photograph over the heads of people that have gotten this experience. So this is not only something that Shrimadaji has, but you yourself have within you that can manifest. And you can see the other on the same series. These are all people just like yourselves that have practiced Sahaja Yoga and established it. The first one I guess, coming up, and there are two lights for Sahaja Yoga, some lights up here and some lights and some eye-opening things to remind you that everything is there. This energy that you see starts coming out in rays at the top of the photograph and becoming more and more pronounced as you go through this series of pictures. See these lights, there were no lights. I'm also these lights now. This is the last of that series where everything has just become moving light. Emanating from where Shrimadaji is sitting. This photograph was taken on a boat in a small town in the city of Nair. In this picture, you can see everything looks quite normal, but as the photographs progress, you can see the tail area of the brain of all the people that are sitting around Shrimadaji, as well as from her satsang. There is the light flowing out from the head's bone. Over to the left is the light. There it's just all like, just flowing outwards. Just like rays of the sun almost. All of this was just taken by one of the sahaja yogis that were on the boat. They just appear on the photographs after they were developed. No one knew that this was going on. No one had any inkling until the photographs were developed. That's the case with all of these. This is just something that the camera recorded that when the film was developed, revealed itself. Then it is, next to this was a rainbow and My face in the sky. But then there were two of them, I don't know why, which is after this. There were a series of photographs that were taken of cloud forming shadows. I was looking at the rainbow. My face was also the same color as the rainbow in the sky. These are some of the children that have been born with this awakening. If you are able to achieve this tonight, which all of you should be, children that are born of parents that have this experience are very often born with this experience of Self Realization. These children are very special. They are very intuitive and they express love very freely. These are some of those kids. This is similar to the diagram that we have here. It is the map of the inner instrument that is contained within us. With the moon channel on the left hand side, as I mentioned earlier, and the blue, I think the slide was reversed, and the sun channel on the right hand side. It is showing the balloon of the ego, which is the byproduct of the use of the right side. When we think, when we plan and act, a byproduct is formed at the top of the head as a balloon called the ego. The same token, the use of the left hand side creates a byproduct and a balloon, subtle balloon, at the top of the head called the super ego. This is the culmination of all of our conditionings. The byproduct is the same. The byproduct is the same. I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the very outset we have to know that truth is what it is. We cannot change it. We cannot read about it. We cannot conceptualize it. Unfortunately at this human awareness we cannot know it. Something has to happen to us that our awareness has to achieve another state, a state of selfhood, a state of Spirit. Whatever I'm going to tell you today, you should not blindfold and believe Me. You have done that quite a lot. But keep an open mind of a scientist and if it works, then as honest people we must accept. Because it is for your benevolence, for the benevolence of your country, for the benevolence of the whole world. In this modern times there have been people who are of a special category, who are seekers of truth. We have made the center that there will be men of God who will come on this earth. They will see and they will find their divinity and they will get powers to make others divine. This is the time that has come for all of you to manifest your divinity which is within your sight. I have to tell you that you all have your divinity absolutely intact within yourself. It's all there. Nothing is destroyed, nothing is caught. It's all there. Because it is eternal in nature. Anything eternal cannot be. Maybe it is covered with clouds because of your, maybe some mistakes, doesn't matter. But it is all there absolutely intact. And this is the reason that some of you are feeling that there has to be something beyond and that we should find out what is that because you don't feel satisfied with whatever life you have. So this is a special time. They call it in the Quran as Daya Maar, meaning the resurrection time. This is the resurrection time where Mohammed Sahab has described that your hands will speak. This is actually, this is what happens to you when you get naturalization of this experience that your finger tips, your thumb, this is the first center, this is the last center, all of them get enlightened and you can feel the centers of others as well as your own centers. So first you get the self-knowledge and then you get the knowledge about life. Also in the Bible they call it the last judgment. There have been all kinds of interpretations that when we die then we'll come back and we'll be just. When we die what we are, bones are going to come out or how are you going to be judged? It should be logical. You are going to be judged in this life with this body of yours and you are going to judge it. So when this Kundalini rises, She passes through these six centers nourishing and also emitting light. When this happens to you then you realize also what is your problem, what centers are there and what is the problem. If you see all world problems are mostly due to lot of problems. We must have real problems. So if somehow we could find out what are these problems coming from human beings, we'll be able to locate the source and the source are these centers within us. Even there is a problem with these centers we have problems. In that case if we can somehow cure those centers, we can cure ourselves, we can cure the whole world. These centers that are within us are also represented outside medically in the physical sense we can say into processes. But medical science you know is such a specialization and medical science is separate then your psychology is different. If you have to go to a doctor you'll find there's one doctor for one eye and another doctor for another eye. Here we are dealing with the totality of a personality because if you try to cure one side maybe another gets affected. So we have to see into the totality of personality which is his physical, mental, emotional, spiritual being. All of that have to be alright and in balance. Just if your physical being is alright and mental being is not alright you can never be enjoying your life. All this totality can be easily brought in integration if this Kundalini passes through these centers which like a thread in a necklace connects all of them together. So first when this Kundalini rises and rises through your fontanel bone area then you get your integration of yourself. For example you want to do something mentally so your heart doesn't help. If your heart like this then your attention doesn't work it out. So first thing that happens to you that you get completely integrated. Secondly this Kundalini is the vital force within you. This vital force gives energy, nourishment to your centers but the greatest thing about you is, the greatest truth is that you are not this body, this mind, this conditionings, egos, emotions and all but you are the pure Spirit. When you achieve that state of pure Spirit then you realize that there is a All-Pervading power of Divine Love, a very subtle. You see these beautiful flowers here, we take them for granted. Isn't it a native miracle that these flowers have come out of small seeds from this Mother Earth spontaneously? Look at our eyes, such a camera, we take it for granted. This brain what a computer, we take it for granted. We do not even think how we have become human beings with God but of course some people have this inquiry, why are we on this earth? All this miraculous, living one, who does it? Suppose if you ask the doctor who runs our heart, he says, it's an autonomous nervous system but who is the auto? If it's an automobile there has to be some driver sitting there, then who bites up? Who is the auto? When we start asking questions, a search, seeking starts and this I call as the people who are the seekers. In Sanskrit they are called as sadhakas. So the second truth is that there is an All-Pervading power of Divine Love which does all these miraculous things. But we have never felt it before, don't we? Not sure you can see it's a miraculous thing but you have never felt that. So when you become the Spirit, then for the first time you feel this All-Pervading power of Divine Love on your fingertips as cool breeze. For example in the Bible we have God Almighty and we have His Sahaja. He has no mother, that's a dove, the third one is a dove. It's very interesting that you have a father, you have a son and no mother. The reason is Paul, the one who edited our Bible, hated women and he didn't want to have any mention of the Mother. Though Christ on the cross did say, behold the Mother. And also if you read the Gospel of Thomas who went to India via Egypt and where he left all his treaties in a jar because he was so angry with Paul. All of them were angry. And he put all these treaties in that jar, was found about 50 years ago and later on was excavated 50 years back and then recorded the whole thing. Now a small part of it is out where he talks about nothing but spontaneous experience of the Spirit. And he has written very clearly that Christ has said many times about the Divine Mother but he said, this Mother has conceived me but I have another way to Mother. M is bigger and when this Mother and the Father are together I am bigger. So this primordial Mother which is described even by being such Athena, Athar, Athar, in Sanskrit Athar means primordial and also in Greek language it means primordial. There are in every literature they have described this primordial Mother and in Indian scriptures she is called as Anishina. So this Holy Ghost is this primordial Mother and when you feel this cool breeze it is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. So the Kundalini is the reflection of that Holy Ghost within us which is the Shakti, which is the power, which is the desire power of God. God Almighty is the spectator and the Shakti does all her work, please put. That's how we have this Kundalini placed in the triangular bone which is second. Greeks knew that it's a second bone, should be called a second bone. This triangular bone contains this power which when awakened like a primule in the seed it rises ascends and pierces through your fontanel bone area. As a result of that you get connected to this All-Pervading power so the union, the actual union, we can call the spiritual union, it is the yoga. Standing on your head is not yoga. It is a Patakya Yoga also if you read it. It's a, he has kashtanas, means eight, eight forms yoga has described in which Yama Dhyama is one of them, out of which one sixteenth part is the exercise meant for people who have problems, physical problems on their body. But then he, you see, has become such a lot of yogamis these days can be anything. A simple thing is the union with this All-Pervading power. This is the spiritual yoga which all of you are capable of getting, not only that but you have a right sahaja yoga, sahaja means with, jaja is born, with you is born this right to get this yoga, to get this union with the yoga. But you must have faith in yourself when I'm saying that. Now as it is, it's a living process and you can't pay for it, first of all you can't pay. How much are you going to pay? Say, how much are you going to pay to this Mother Earth for these flowers? So how much are you going to pay for something that is living work within us of evolution? We have not paid for any evolution, why should we pay now? But unfortunately I must say, when I came first in, in, in America, that was in 1972 and they said, we can't accept anything for which you don't have to pay. Even the BBC interviewer said to Me in that letter that a agro-sex and brain cannot understand anything that for which you don't have to pay. I said, who has made this agro-sex and brain? Is it made by God or somebody else that it is so different? So I gave up all hopes that I'm a nine years old and I can become. The first thing you must understand, you cannot pay for it, you cannot purchase it. Christ has said that meek in heart will inherit the heart. We have to be meek about it. If you think we can purchase our Guru, we can purchase God, it's not true, it cannot. It is first and fundamental thing which I would like you to understand and you can't pay for it. And it has to be effortless. Now another theory is very common that you must give up all that you have, of course money wise and the things that's, apart from that you must suffer. There's one theory that you go to Gobi Desert, walk to Mycenaean Thiruvannam, in any case you die, I mean it's because of the moral value. So make people suffer. You must suffer, you must pass, give money to Me. When I say this really, so many people have paid so much money to this nonsensical kind of people who have just had no fear of God that in the name of God they have reached simple, innocent people. All kinds of facts, all kinds of things started and as our freedom has given us choices, you see. They were telling Me how many types of serious you have here, of course, I would go back. So this choices started even in your city. So like a guru shopping started, you see, oh this guru, that guru, then that guru. The other day I met one, he had schizophrenia after the worst time he came to Me. He said, Mother, can you hear Me? I said, yes but what about your guru shopping? I could see him, all the gurus sitting down here and there. So he said, Mother, the latest one should I tell you? I said, you don't tell Me, I know all of them sitting here. And he is now schizophrenic. Schizophrenic temperament or we can call a patient is very common in America. In India we don't know what is schizophrenia, we have either mad or sad. Nothing in India. There are solid people in India, if anybody comes like this, they'll get lost. So they came here nicely to you because you didn't know what it was like to get you. I've met so many people. I don't mind making money but they have spoiled your chakras by that. Sometimes it's difficult to raise the Kundalini because of the obstruction. But does not matter. I've told you, your divinity is intact. But this guru shopping business has to be stopped. If you find here your realization, go deep into it. Right? When you dig the well and you find what is somebody wanting in there, you don't want making steel holes everywhere. So now, we come to another point, what is the Spirit and when you get the Self, what happens to you? Of course you think, Mother, it's all very fantastic. But you are fantastic. Suppose I take a small little box and tell some remote village in India that this is called television and you can see all kinds of beautiful films in this. They'll say, what this box is? It's just a box. We all think we are boxes. We don't know how fantastic it is. So when you put it to the mains, you can see. In the same way we are built in that way. Nothing has to be done. It's all there. Like you see all the lights around here. Just have to put on one switch and they are on because they are already built in. In the same way within you is all built in this special instrument which works it out beautifully, your Self-realization. So the first thing that happens that you feel is cool breeze of the Holy Ghost on your fingertips. Second thing that happens to you that you become thoughtlessly aware which is described also in Patalini yoga is Nivi Chahal Samadhi where your thoughts which are coming from the past and from the future and we are jumping on the cusp of that, suddenly relax and there is a space in between you, created by this Kundalini which is the present and in the present you don't think. When you are in the present you don't think. Now if you want to think, you think but if you don't want to think, you will not think. So all this stress and all these modern diseases that have come are just because most of them are because we think too much. Then the peace that we talk of everywhere. I have more people who have got noble prize in this, I mean know them very well because my another life with my husband is related with all such people. They have no peace in their heart, nothing. They are extremely hot-nippered people. You want to talk to them, take a barge pole and they have got these prizes, peace, noble prize. What to do, whom to tell? It's something so artesian but in reality the peace is within yourself like a wheel which is moving on the periphery but in the center is the axis and if you can jump onto your axis then you are absolutely peaceful and you see all your periphery like a trap, you become a witness, just witness of a trap. To give another example we'll say that supposing you are in the water and there are lots of waves, you are frightened of getting trapped but somehow if you can get into your boat, you see the same waves and enjoy them but if you know how to swim, you can jump into those waves, enjoy them and can save many people. This is exactly what happens to you. So the peace that is within you starts manifesting and you become an extremely peaceful person. You actually emit this. When the Spirit starts manifesting in your attention, your attention is, you feel through your central nervous system. Then first thing is happens to you that your attention becomes pure and stable. Christ has said, thou shall not have adulterous eyes, means your eyes should not have lust and guilt. Very hard if you say, Mother how to do that? Many have told Me, Mother our eyes go like this, like this all the time, like mad men but once this Kundalini comes up and you get into this union with this Divine power, your eyes become pure, absolutely pure and such eyes are so innocent and so powerful that even a glass of these eyes can change and transform other people. This is what happens to people once this Kundalini fixes you up with that vital power of divinity. Above all the same attention becomes effective, becomes feel on your finger-tips your own centers and centers of others. Thus you become collectively conscious. A new dimension comes into you that you become collectively conscious. Who is the other then? The microcosm becomes the microcosm. Who is the other? You start feeling the other with all your finger-tips. If you know how to correct them, you can correct that person. Sitting down here you can feel the centers of anyone you want to be, dead, alive or far away. You take about ten children who are realized also, tie their eyes and put somebody in front of them and ask them, what's wrong with this person? Supposing they email this, this finger, they all raise one finger because they know absolute truth. You ask a gentleman, are you suffering from heart failure? Yes, of course, but how do you know? This finger denotes the heart. So you know the absolute truth. So far we do not know absolute truth. A person says something, B person says something, C person says something, then that is all. Now, this very nice I'm happy that Mr. Freud has been informed to be HOBAS folks. Very good idea. But when I said in twenty-two years back, they didn't like Me. And that this psycho-analysis is all HOBAS focus is also now set by many people and even the two books come out of very great spots. He ruined people by his own ideas and by ruining us, people were so much identified with him that they didn't like to hear anything against him. And today you see the result. He is exposed. After his exposure you know that he was wrong. But on your finger tips you can feel what was wrong with him. He was empty, he had died of cancer, he had bad relations with his mother and that's what he wants to apply to everyone, internalizing. It is unbelievable these theories were so deep in his absolute important. Recently one gentleman asked me, what did Mr. Freud say? I just told you in one sentence that he said that there's some sort of a relationship between child and the mother and so on. And he said, he said, I've got a gift come to the other end, you've got chopped in little bones and thrown away. In taller women you say such things about them. It's an abuse in India and you'll know if somebody says something like this, you can be arrested and put in jail. You can't say anything like this. It's an abuse. While it was accepted in America for God. These yarns that came out, perhaps maybe the Catholic religion which started another yarn of original sin. So to counter-balance that they must have surrendered to this only both are not. How can Christ attend a wedding if it is, if it's an original sin? It's a very practical thing, it's a natural thing that we should get married, have children, have families. All these nonsense of original sin must have come from suffering sin. So many things like that logically you must have. And this is what made, must have made people to jump on to that and complete ruination of their childless. Somebody comes up with some items, they think it's new so we should take it. Is it necessary to take to everything that is new? Like one day I was sitting with the ambassador of Mexico, he's a white man. He said, I know you don't like Freud, of course I said I don't but you know he gave us something new. I said, see, you're excellency, you have eaten all this food before but you have never eaten the table which is new, better try it. He was really undimocratic on my part. So everything new is not great. We must have our own understanding, our own personality, what to accept and what not to accept. That is also possible only when you have your self-realization. As I told you, you know the absolute. Anybody comes out of Indian jails straight away, goes and wears those dresses, funny dresses, all kinds of things and puts some odds, comes here and becomes a great master. Nobody wants to see what sort of a man he is, what are his tendencies, what is his private life, what he preaches and what he practices. After realization if such a person you face, immediately you'll know he's a real cheat because your fingers will stand firm. Not only that but you might get a pistol from some of them. This is all described in the Bible such people will be my people. So you know the absolute but it has a very wider implication because if you know the absolute truth, all of you know the same truth and I'm sitting here, you all see Me and you all know that I'm sitting here, there's no quarrel about it. In the same way, when all of you know the same truth, why will you quarrel, why will there be fights, why will there be discussions of people and why will there be wars, no point. Now in India we have a seminar every year about three thousand people come from fifty five countries. I've never seen them quarrelling, fighting, never. Of course they bully each other slightly because they have lot of fun. They have fun. Life is a fun, it is not something serious. It's a fun but you have to reach that state when you know what is real one and what is not. These problems are because everybody has his own ideas and he thinks that's just the truth. But there's no substance in it. The reality is very different, the reality is unique, it's absolute. And once you know this absolute, there's no quarrel, no fight. So you know the absolute because this Spirit is the source of truth, the source of love, compassion, pure love but also it is the source of truth. Suppose if you really love somebody, then you know everything about that person. But this is much more than that, that you really know the absolute truth about everything, about every man, about every man. And all of you know the same thing. Also the Spirit is the universal being because it's the reflection of God Almighty and reflection has to be the same. Once it starts manifesting, we become a universal personality. That way we are logically also. See, you've got the skill little bit, you find the same way in every one, the same mode, the same art is everything the same. We laugh the same, we cry the same way, the feelings are the same. Only difference comes in the faces. It is in the, has to be otherwise you would have been so boring you know to see everybody in the same face, with the same color, the same eyes. It's a variety that creates the beauty and interest in life and that is what God has done but I mean I don't know, everything He has done is of, is of, goes into fiasco. I don't know how human beings have a speciality to make everything beautiful into something nice and small. We are all made the same being but the Spirit being, the universal being, we all just forget the superficial differences and we just feel that we are all human beings. This is the first time you start enjoying each other. I think compassion is so great. When I went to Russia, first time not, because Russians I must say, are really very sensitive to spirituality. They have no, not so many secrets. They have not so many choices. They have no choices. Whatever is in the market is there, you better have it or don't have it. There is no way of going shopping or things like that. So their attention is just there, there's not freedom of it but they are so sensitive, I'll tell you, I'll tell you, they have never heard My name, they have never told Me who I was and just they were there seeing My face. Apart from that they were so many there that I was amazed that inside went three thousand sitting and three thousand still absent. They said, what about us? I said, alright, let me see. When I came to the realization to women, they were all sitting outside, sitting waiting for Me when I came out. They said, Mother, what about us? All of them sitting down there. I said, alright, tomorrow you all come along, we'll have the program outside, not in the hall. All those who were sitting outside and all those who were inside, all of them were in the kitchen. Once they get realization they are there, you'll be amazed how deep they are. The day may come it might be the most powerful country, apart from India I don't know. India's also makes us a little different, I'm very vulnerable but between the two I can't say. But when I went to Russia first, twenty-five Sahaja Yogis from Germany came, these Germans, you know, they are boys and ladies. I asked them, how are you here? Don't you think Mother, it's our responsibility? I said, your responsibility? Yes, one out of four fathers. You have to do it, it kills in their eyes. You'll be amazed, they stop all people that you have seen and the gentlest people you could ever find, extremely gentle. After Sahaja Yoga, I don't know what has happened to them or their genetics have changed a lot, they are so gentle. You won't believe that they are the same Germans about who we are person. Such a change, except for these Germans still I don't know, they are the people who have been always very angry with everyone but otherwise. It is very surprising how this compassion bends away the heart and you feel so compelled that you have to have this. Now we have no organization, you'll be surprised, I have no secretary. We have nothing that I could say, this is my off-wheel service, nothing but everything is working out because everybody is bicycling away, everybody is trying to do it. They are not paid for money, they get no money, I get no money but they feel from their heart that what they have got it should be into. We have to do this and the enjoyment that they get out of it is so great that this thousand times more than getting any money out of it. Because you get after realization the power to raise the Kundalini, give realization to others, cure others, you get all the subtle knowledge about your being with Indians for which you don't have to pay again. Of course you might have to pay for this for all. Formerly I used to pay for all the whores but nowadays these people have started paying for their whores. That's different but for your realization and for your work you don't pay. There is no compulsion on them, no payment, nothing. You are free, government-wise. There are some who have left Sahaja Yoga, we are very happy they have left because they were not the people who were preaching the same as their practice. In Sahaja Yoga it becomes the fullness as we call it, the innate which has been asked, the righteousness so innately built in and manifesting that whatever you say you do, now somebody who has been Christian, Hindu, Muslim, Indian can commit a sin, can kill anybody what would they like, there's no proportion, not in Sahaja Yoga. Overnight I've seen people have given up their sin, overnight. I don't say, don't say anything against them. I do not say against or for, don't do this, don't do this. These ten commandments I never say but automatically you do it because you get the life. For example, if you are holding a snake and I tell you, you have a snake in your hand, you will say, no, it's not snake, it's a rope because it's sharp, yes, you can't see. Till that snake bites you, you will be alright. But supposing you see the life even a little bit of it, you immediately throw it away, like that, you throw away all your habits which are destructive, which you have just accepted without any standards. Also your diseases disappear. I must tell you, we have seen many blood cancer patients being cured in this country. So many diseases have been cured that I tell you, I cannot tell you. All kinds of diseases are cured through your own good beginning, through your own path. Diagnosis is just all difficulties, you don't have to go anywhere. Even I mean the hospital, they kill you with diagnosis only. But here the diagnosis is simple because I said, believe me, you are all fantastic. So you can diagnose yourself, you can diagnose other people and you know how to cure them by very, very simple, simple things that happen, how to correct the chakras and once you do that, you are alright. We have now three doctors here in India, three doctors in India who have got their MD, after their MBBS in sahaja yoga, in curing, in development, like asthma, they will have seen what they have done. But many have been cured. Now the best part of it that we never write it down, who has cured too much, it's a, it's a not very horrible. Suppose you give food to somebody, you don't find out how to give food to somebody. In the same way, somebody is cured, they don't find out what you do, they are cured. Now the other day I've seen, like we are on the television, they have some lady talking about she has been cured of this and cured of that and they have all seen it. Absolutely not! With heat if you have cured, these are simply not. If somebody shakes before you go in there, you are cured, it's absolutely not. In some sort of a that we call the Pretha Vidya is the, what is that there, uh.. black magic or some sort of a spirit they use and with that they cure. But they put the spirit in you and once you have so called cured, you develop other problems. But you must know the whole modus operandi as to how you cure and how other person also should know how it is done and it should be tangible through medical science. It should have been a lot cured. How? What happened? What did you do? If you ask such a question, they won't be able to say. Oh just I say like this, I pray, pray, pray, I'm at it. Even this prayer, when you have no connection, was there some prayer? If the telephone has no connection versus a telephone, that's why Christ has said, you will be calling me Jesus, Jesus, I won't recognize. Most of these fundamentals must be the ones you have to mention. They are fundamentals, Christians, fundamentalists, you see, fundamentals, this is my fundamentalist. What is fundamentalist there? If it is fundamental, you cannot be fundamentalist because fundamentally we are all one. So the religion is universal within us, in any field and all the religions are fundamental. On the tree of life all these flowers have come, on the tree of spirituality they have prospered at different times. People plucked them and now they are fighting with these dead flowers. There's no life. Moreover all these religions are not speaking to Indian at all. They are only power oriented or money oriented. Here the other day we saw one picture, no one, some of it, I don't know what it was, where he said, you release hundred dollars, release hundred dollars, so actually you'll be surprised, a hundred dollars, no? And he said, you release it and then you get all the places. There was one lady, she had said, I have saved, crucified for her, grocery hundred dollars, she released it to us, she gives the phone number and all that and she saw the grocery in her doorstep and then the groceries started dropping from her roof and people immediately talked for one hour. Such a gluttonous nonsense. I was shocked, I mean how could he talk like this? And people believed what happens to their intelligence and people are giving money to them who are simple, faithful, in the name of God. All right. So the highest thing that happens to you when you become this Spirit, that you jump into the ocean of joy. Joy cannot describe you, it's an experience but you cannot do anything like happiness and unhappiness. When your ego is pampered you feel very happy and when it is punctured you feel unhappy but joy is a state. In which you see the essence of joy in everything. For example now, there's a very beautiful shawl is spreaded. I watch this. Now somebody, if I own this one and if I'm not realized so, then I'll worry about how much will it cost and I must ensure it and all that nonsense. But if I don't own, then also I'll look at it, where should I get such a nice thing, where should I buy this? But if I'm a realized soul, then I'll watch this. As soon I watch the beauty, I will go thoughtlessly on my hand and all the joy that the artist has put in this, to make this, starts pouring on me like a soothing, beautiful feeling. That's what is true. And you don't think, you just watch and the essence of joy that is there, starts just absorbing. Of course so many other things happen which I must tell you that your memory improves. You become extremely creative. There are many great artists in India that tell you after coming to Sahaja Yoga, they have become so creative. Also that your age drops out, at least 20 years. You become extremely dynamic, at the same time extremely compassionate. Now, I'm 70 years of age and travelling every night, every night and doing this work. I have a very good family, my husband is very well-placed alive, I come from a royal family, all that is there but I can't enjoy my life unless eventually I steal a gift. Because first of all, when you have the powers, you are the capitalist. And when you have the power, you can't live without distribution, you are the communist. All these theories which look funny become minor. You can't exist, you can't enjoy anything unless it's you. You begin these joy-lives. This is how the whole world has to be transformed. And all of you have to have feelings that you have to become the maker of that world which is very simple, very joy-believing. Also this All-Pervading Power, you've seen these, these slides now. I mean, there's nothing we have, we have miles and miles of them and every day something new appears. Who is doing this in this All-Pervading Power? I told him that this will start showing also in the temples, churches and all that and now people are seeing them, some photographs are coming in the temples and churches also. So, you feel absolutely blissful. All the time you feel there's somebody who's protecting you, some force which is guiding you. All the time there's some sort of a miracle is happening and you're amazed how it happens, how it works out. So many miracles have happened in Sahaja Yoga. And they wrote letters after letters to Me, so I told one gentleman that why not compile them together. After one month he says, Mother, all the time on both the sides they have come to My head, now what should I compile? I don't know what to do with it. How many volumes have I to write? I say, Mother, I won't write. Do what to write. He says, it's impossible. Next month again it will be another mountain coming to Me. But these miracles are so sweet and so beautiful and so nourishing that I wish sometimes we could sit down and make some at least of them available to you all. You'll find all My Sahaja Yogis will be laughing, enjoying themselves but they are very decent, they are very good citizens. My husband in the beginning used to say that you are not real means you are a very evolved soul but you can't break others. It was impossible. But now he says, they are all angels. You all can be angels because you have that ability within yourself. But first thing is that you must have a pure desire to have your Self-realization. I cannot force you because I respect your freedom. It cannot be forced. It will take about ten, fifteen minutes to get your Self-realization. But I would say those who don't want to know, I cannot force them and they should leave the hall and not disturb us. Just take fifteen minutes more and if you want to stay, then please don't go in between the time when we are doing this. This process of awakening doesn't take much time at all but as I said you must have pure desire. I wish we had more time for you to ask Me questions but the main thing I would like to tell you about questioning that for the last twenty-two years I've been doing question and answer and this question and answer I think I'm quite an expert now. I know what to answer and quite a lot. It's a little bit I must admit, it's just a little bit. I don't guarantee your ascent because this is beyond the mind. You go beyond the mind, your attention goes beyond the mind. Like I'll show you. Now this is the attention is spread out at this level and then the Kundalini starts rising. She puts all the attention inside and here then at the apex She breaks, then all the grace starts falling on the sides and you feel very relaxed. Then in the brain through the nerves it starts enlightening your nerves and you feel good breeze of the brain because now your fingertips are enlightened as in the Vedic of terminology they say that sympathetic sympathetic endings are on the fingertips. I must say I've read medicine myself that the treatment that people give is like treating a tree from outside but Sahaja Yoga is the knowledge of the roots. Our civilization has grown so big but we don't know about our roots and if it is coming from the beast, one should not find it. After all so much knowledge of science has gone to the beast. So what is the harm if somebody brings this knowledge of the roots to you from the beast? It's very important to understand that in the Kingdom of God there is nothing like East and West. So you have to enter into the Kingdom of God and for that you should get out these things because somebody in the other hand told Me that people think that Christ was born in India or in America as a country. It's historically not. It is important that we have to understand we are not so small that we can belong to one small parent or to one small country or to another. We belong to the whole world and the whole world belongs to us. Only we have to get that expansion within ourselves. So now there are simple things have to be done. Again I say those who want to go those people who cannot see Me if someone wants can come in fright also if you want. Some people in might say this side just it. There's no need to see Me, there's no need at all. It's all there in that posture. Just believe that there's nothing to see Me as. Now, so there are three conditions which I must say, which I must say something to you by now. Three conditions. The first one is that all of you have to believe and have full faith in yourself and should know that you are all going to get your Self-realization tonight. Please don't doubt yourself. So it follows that whatever mistakes you might have committed, anything of that kind then you should have no guilt whatsoever at this moment. After all you are human beings, you are not gods. Only human beings will come into this place. So doesn't matter. At this all pervading power of God's love is the ocean of forgiveness. Whatever mistakes you have committed can be easily resolved by that. So why, why should you condemn yourself for nothing at all? So have no guilt at all. People might have told you that you are silly, are means that. Those who tell you must be the sinners. Okay, get it? But it's very important because if you feel guilty then you would land on a center of a left hand side of the heart. Which is very dangerous even physically. You might develop spondylitis, you might develop angina, you might develop very lethargic hormones, some very dangerous things. So why feel guilty? If you have done some mistakes, please sit up and please sit down. But don't carry it here as a load, all the time killing yourself and have a spondylitis. What to, why you have the pain in the neck? I'm just telling you that you have, you have full confidence in yourself and please know that you are not guilty in that eyes of the divine. Just please forgive yourself. The second condition is, you don't feel guilty is the first condition you can call it on the second one. And the third one is very, very simple is that you have to forgive everyone in general. For some people it's very, very difficult but psychologically if you forgive or you don't forgive, what do you do? What do you do? Nothing. But when you don't forgive then you play in wrong hands. Those who have troubled you, tortured you, they all nicely enjoy life and you are torturing yourself. But when the Kundalini is rising, this center of awareness is constricted. See the optic chalc now, can you imagine, like this and it won't open unless until you forgive. You have to forgive. Then it opens. People will bear a cross and they will come and tell you, but they are very difficult to forgive. I said they come, they cross, they stay. Forgive everyone. Such a headache and you don't have to think about them also because that's also headache. As soon as you will say that, I forgive everyone in general without thinking about them, you will much like it. It's very important that you forgive everyone. As it is, you have suffered so much and are you going to miss this opportunity of Self-realization because your architecture gets closed. So please forgive everyone in general. These are the three conditions which I hope you will do. I have full confidence in you, I have no guilt about it, forget the past and forgive everyone without even thinking about it, in general. The only thing we have to take little help from Mother Earth, so you can take out your shoes. Those who are sitting on the ground are all around you. Sit comfortably. Comfort is the main thing you must achieve. You don't have to stand on your head, you don't have to go to Malayas, you don't have to start fast. Be comfortable. That is Mother's time. Now as the left and right side are two different powers, the left side is the power of desire, the right side is the power of action. Please put both your feet apart for me. No, no, for you it's all right. Sitting on the ground is all right. Perfect. That's the perfect thing. You have to sit like this otherwise. No, you remove your asanas, just shavas. This is called as sahaja sah. Spread your legs a little bit, not to put them in the top. No, not like that, just have to do. I mean, yogasana or what? I mean, if there's any problem, we'll also tell you what asanas to be done. It's a science, which you should understand, not to take all the medicine from the medicine box and just give it. You can sit on the chair if you are more comfortable. Now, what we have to do is to put the left hand on your lap comfortably towards Me, your left hand, because this is a symbol or symbolically you are designing Self-realization. Put the hand towards Me on your lap, comfortably or on your arms, any way you like. And with the right hand we have to nourish our centers on the left hand side. We are working only on the left hand side. So first we have to put our right hand on our heart. Here resides the Spirit in the heart. Now, if you are the Spirit, you are the Spirit, you are the Master. In the light of the Spirit you become your own guide, you become your own master, your own guru. So now take down your right hand, the upper portion of your abdomen, the left hand side, which is the center of your mastery. This center has been created by the masters and prophets, which is to be enlightened, later on by Google. Now please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen. This is the center of pure knowledge of the mind. Now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen. We are showing to you now and then we close our eyes and we do the processing. Now take your right hand down on the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Now take your right hand on your heart. Now in the corner of your head and your shoulder, as I told you what happens when these centers reach your body and you feel this. Turn your head to your right. Now take your right hand on top of your forehead across and please put down your head as far as possible. Here you have to forgive everyone in your mind. Please take your right hand on the back side of your head and push back your head as far as possible. Here without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness from this All-Pervading Divine power. Now the last center is touch your palm as much as you can. Put the center of your palm on top of your head. On top of the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood. Now please put down your head as much as you can. This is important now to push back your fingers and your thumb so there's a good pressure on your scalp. So there's a good pressure on your scalp. Now please move your scalp slowly, clockwise, seven times. Scap, move it, push back your fingers very hard, put down your head, put down your head, push back your fingers and move it seven times. Don't hold your head, push back your hands, that's all we have to do. That's all we have to do. Now again you have to put your feet apart from each other. If there's anything tight on your waist or on your neck, you can little bit loosen it. You have to sit straight, not with anything, just on it. You're a very comfortable man. Put the left hand towards Me and the right hand on your heart. Now you have to close your eyes, you can take out your glasses. Your spectacles should be removed because you have to keep your eyes slightly lighter. Please close your eyes and don't open them till I tell you. Here you have to ask Me a very fundamental question about yourself. You can call Me Mother, Ashri Mataji, whatever you like. Mother, am I the Spirit? Ask this question in your heart three times. Mother, am I the Spirit? If you are the Spirit, you are your master. So now please put your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side and ask another fundamental question in your heart three times. Mother, am I my own master? Ask this question three times. I've already told you that I respect your freedom and I cannot force pure knowledge out of you. You have to ask Me. So now please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side and here you have to ask six times because this center has got six petals. Mother, please give me the pure knowledge of the Divine. Please say it six times. As soon as you ask for the Divine knowledge, the Kundalini starts rising. So we have to open the upper centers with our self-confidence. So now please raise your right hand on to the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side and please press it hard. Here with full confidence in yourself, you have to say it ten times, Mother, I am my own master. Say it with full confidence. I have already told you that you are not this body, this mind, this conditioning, this ego, these emotions, but you are the pure Spirit. So now please, raise your right hand on your heart and here with full confidence, please say twelve times in your heart, Mother, I am the pure Spirit. Mother, I am the pure Spirit. Please say twelve times in your heart, Mother, I am the pure Spirit. Mother, I am the pure Spirit. The All-pervading power of Divine love is the ocean of knowledge, ocean of compassion and ocean of bliss. But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness and whatever mistakes you might have committed can be easily dissolved by this ocean of forgiveness. So please forgive yourself. Raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right. Here you have to say, again with full confidence, sixteen times, Mother, I am not easy at all. Please say it three times. I have already told you logically whether you forgive or you don't forgive, you don't do anything. But if you don't forgive then you play in wrong hands. Moreover, if you do not forgive, this Adrya Chakra will go to open and the Kundalini cannot pass through it and you miss this opportunity, the greatest opportunity of getting your Self-realization. So now please take your right hand on top of your forehead across and please put down your head. Here you have to say again with full confidence, without thinking about the people who have hurt you. Say it from your heart, not how many times, from your heart. Mother, I forgive everyone in general. Say it from your heart. Please don't say it is difficult, please don't say that. Now, please take your right hand on the back side of your head and push back your head as far as possible. Here without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction, you have to say. O Divine power, if I have done anything wrong, knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me. This again you have to say it from your heart, not how many times but from your heart. O Divine power, if I have done anything wrong, please forgive me. Now, last set. Please, stretch your palm. Now put the center of your palm on top of your head. O Divine power. Now put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area and now bend your head as far as possible, please bend. Stretch your fingers so that there's a good pressure on your scalp. Here again I respect your freedom. I cannot force Self-realization on you. You have to ask for it. So now move your scalp seven times clockwise slowly, saying, Mother, please give me Self-realization. You have to ask, Mother, please give me Self-realization. O Divine power, if I have done anything wrong, please forgive me. Now put your palm on top of your head. Now please, take your hand out of your head. O Divine power, if I have done anything wrong, please forgive me. Now please, take down your hands and slowly open your eyes. Open your eyes slowly. Put both the hands like this towards Me. Now, watch Me without thinking. Now, please put your right hand towards Me like this and bend your head and see with your left hand if there's a cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. It may be a hot wave like breeze, could be warm, could be cool. If you have not forgiven, then it would be hot. So please forgive now. Now, please put your left hand towards Me like this. Now, bend your head and see with your right hand if there's a cool or warm or hot breeze like wave coming from your fontanel bone area. Now please don't put your hand on top of your head but away from it and see for yourself if you can feel cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. Now, please put your right hand on top of your head. Some people get it very close to the head, some people get it very far. So just move your hand and see for yourself. It is you who has to certify that there's no air conditioner in your head, so it's coming out from there. Now, see the right hand, right hand but don't put your hand on your head, away, away from it, away. Now put your right hand again once more. Now see with your left hand, see for your, with your left hand. Now, please put both your hands towards the sky like this and push back your head. And now ask a question, one of these questions three times, one of these, Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Divine Love which is all-pervading power? Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya? Anyone of these? One question, anyone of these, ask three times. Not a darn good one. All those who are fed, who are caught, who walk in this light, on their finger-tips or in their hands or palms or on to their fontanel bone area, please raise both your hands. Shri Mataji, may God bless you! This is Seattle, the saints of Seattle, I bow to you. Some people they feel there's matter, you can wait here, these people you've worked out. You can also see how it worked out and how it manifests. Doesn't matter if some people have not felt but most of you have felt the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, the all-pervading power of God's love. May God bless you all! One thing I have to tell you that Sahaja Yoga in modern times is not an individual happening but it's a collective thing. You have to come to the collective thing. Like if I cut one of My nails, it won't grow. So many people they stare at home, they stare to home, Mother we felt very happy and all that, we are very good at it. Doesn't work out. You have to be in the collective and enjoy the collective. You will find there are people who are very good in Sahaja Yoga already and they know everything, they'll be very sweet, nice and compassionate to you and they'll tell you everything. So don't feel bad, in any way they will never say anything bad about you but try to grow in collective. For which you don't have to pay, it's not like an introduction lecture and then the money. If anybody asks, they'll let Me know. Nobody will ask. So you just enjoy yourself and you exteriorize them again. I'm sure I'll meet all of you exterior, I may stay longer with you and you have to not only know what it is, all the subtle knowledge about yourself but you have to select it. If you put a light, if you enlighten a light, this for the others, this light and you'll enjoy it. Those who have not felt, should not feel bad. You can get it in no time, everyone has to get it. So those who have not felt, wait for a while and the sahaja yogis can manage that. See, you'll be surprised how many people you move, other you'll find, how many people you'll feel. It's so simple. So enjoy this silence and from today you have entered into the kingdom of God, just watch and see. But now I know you won't go on being too shocked. I've got there is decision and I'll go to other people, I'll judge people. In a way what I want to say is that you must respect your surroundings, you must respect your personality, you must respect that you are something special, that you have achieved something special, that you are special people and this is a very silent spiritual revolution that is going in which you must play many active part, that's why you have got your realization. So I hope you'll understand your own dignity, your own decision in the plane of the Divine and don't waste your energies in nonsensical things. I expect that all of you will be all this. Also if I've said something which makes you feel guilty, also forget it, come to Me. It's a matter of, I should say fashion that people feel guilty also, but not in a way. You are not to feel guilty and tell all the trees on the way that we have implemented. Until then we are all injured now. May God bless you. What is it? What is it?

All right? Felicity, you better sit on some chair, be careful. Are you all right? Yes, yes, it's all right, be careful. Yes, it's all right. It's expels, eh? All right. So, should we start now? Is it all right? Are we focused, just? Yes, it's okay. Forgive Me now and then I'll turn away and look at the time. I'll just be checking. I'll do that for some reason. It's all right. That's enough. Or an extension, if you have an extension cord, that would work too. Do you want to just hold a watch? That would be perfectly all right too, if I could borrow a watch from somebody. It's a digital one, I'm afraid. I'm not going to be on camera so I can look at the watch and do all sorts of things. You can do what you like. I'm going to jingle it around. It takes too long. Not rolling yet. Are you rolling? Just the legs. Legs, okay. I'm setting up. Just resetting it. Is the telephone off the hook? Yes, it is. When the little one may start crying. That would be nice. That would be a nice sound. Neck. You must look after the neck of the baby. That's the Vishuddhiya. That's the little motherhood. Okay. So about fifty minutes. We'll make it about fifty minutes long. Alright. I will answer in short, would be better. Whatever you feel like. Because how many questions you'll ask, it depends on. I don't know. Depends on how long your answers are. I can go on. It's all spontaneous. So ten twenty. If we started at ten twenty, what time? Fifty minutes later, please. I don't know. We'd better keep it facing for Me. So if we start at ten twenty, then if we finish at eleven ten, that's fifty minutes? Fifty minutes will do. It could be long then. It's all right. It's all right. Okay. Okay. Okay. You can roll. Mataji, in order to understand the process of realization, which is very complicated and almost has a kind of scientific discipline to it, but first maybe you could say a word about the goal in order to anchor our discussion. So could you say something about the highest realization, what the goal of this entire process is? The goal of this process is, to begin with, we should say, is to become the Spirit. The Spirit is the reflection of our Creator, the God Almighty in our heart, which is the collective being within us. Now of course this is all a theory for you, and you can say in a hypothesis, but it's a fact and can be found out. After you get your Self-realization, you feel the manifestation of the Spirit in your nervous system, in your conscious mind. This is the goal, to begin with. You see, if you talk of the very higher things, it could be confusing. So the first is Self-realization. That is the first goal. You said that the Spirit, you define the Spirit as the reflection of God Almighty in the heart. Yes, please. What is, what do you mean by God Almighty? God Almighty is the one who is everything. He is the one who is the Creator. He is the one who has desire to create, the one who is, can destroy if he has no desires left, and He is the one who gives us the Spirit. And He is the one who gives us sustenance, who gives us this evolution by which we have become human beings. He is the entire thing. It is all His play. I was under the impression that the Kundalini was Mother Kundalini and that, that this energy was feminine, and now you refer to the Divine as He. Yes, He is Divine and She is also Divine, both could be Divine. But He is the one who is the witness of the play of His desire, and His desire is the Primordial Kundalini, is the Primordial Mother, is the Holy Ghost, as they call it. And She is reflected within us as the Kundalini. When this reflection that is the Kundalini meets the reflection that is the Spirit, then the yoga takes place, then the union takes place. What was, what was the Divine doing before it created anything? It was sleeping. It was complete silence and then it awoke. When it is awakened, a creation is created out of His power. But He is just the witness. Is, is the goal to participate in the Divine play or to return to the complete silence? First is to get into that play, to become one with the whole. That is the first goal, as I said. And you, you don't think it would be helpful to speak about anything beyond that? Just now it can be dangerous, you see. This is difficult for people in the West who don't understand the idea of, of a secret teaching that unfolds as, as a person develops. They, they overhear, we think that we can hear everything all at once. You see, it is a living process. And in the West I don't know how many have studied living processes. Living process is never like that. First the seed, then the roots, then the tree, then the leaves and then the flowers and then the fruit. See, so the, it is a living process. Now we are human beings at the stage when we are flowers. Now we have to become the fruits. Then the fruit has to grow. Once we understand living process, we can understand why. We have to first get Self-realization. That's why Buddha did not talk of God. Because if you talk of God, it's too far-fetched. So better to talk of Self-realization first he thought. Because if you talk of something abstract, then people get fizzled out. So as a spiritual mother you, you teach your children and show them how to become one with the entire cosmic play? Yes, first of all to become the, your microcosm should become one with the macrocosm. First feel that, first understand that and then grow into it. Now how do your, your disciples or your spiritual children do this? It's obviously not just a matter of philosophy, but thinking about it, how do they proceed along the path? As I said it's a living process and for living process you cannot do anything about it. It's spontaneous. But as in the living process you have seen that if you have to sprout a seed, you have to put it to the Mother Earth. And the Mother Earth has the capacity to sprout it spontaneously. You don't have to do anything about it. In the same way if I am the Mother Earth, if you put your hands towards Me you can get your realization. It's very simple. But once you get realization, you can also give realization to others by raising their Kundalini because from your hand that Divine power starts flowing. For the first time after realization you start feeling the Divine power. Many things happen though I said it's slow, but it's very fast. It's so, so fantastic and so dynamic that even Self-realization is difficult to contain. Many spiritual traditions they'll talk about spiritual cultivation. It's a, if you just put a seed in the Earth and just leave it to chance, many, many, many unfortunate things can happen. Are there any disciplines or protections that your students engage in? For instance, dietary restrictions or formal meditation or different practices? I don't think you need it anymore. You have done it in previous lives now. You have had enough of it. You don't need anymore now. What you need is your realization. The trouble is we must also understand that the creation of God is the epitome, is the human race and it is on the brink of its destruction. So the Divine itself has taken steps to see that forgive everything. Now just get them realized, you see. It's like emergency, you can say, or the last judgment has started or the resurrection time as described by Mohammed Sahib has started. He has precisely once said that your hands will speak what Sahaja Yoga is doing. He's all described also by many saints thousands of years back, the seers who have described the coming of Sahaja Yoga in those days. So you feel that you have experienced or you have the vision that the human race is living in the last days in a time of unusual cosmic emergency and flowering? Of course, no doubt about it. Without that they would not take to God also. This is something with human beings. Unless and until they are put to that kind of a frantic condition, they just don't look at things. But haven't human beings almost always felt that way? I mean, hasn't there always been a frantic condition? Haven't spiritual teachers, most of them always warned people that there is not much time left and that they're living in the last days? I don't think they did that way because most of them said that this will happen. They always talked of future. All the prophets have talked of the future of this time. Even William Blake who came hundred years back has talked about it. Everybody has talked about this time that this blossom time will come and that is the time many flowers will become fruits. And if these, why precarious? Because at that time it's a very delicate time. At the time when you are flowers it's easy to destroy. It's beautiful that you call it a blossoming time. I mean, many, many people who predict the doom, doom, doomsday would call this time of great destruction but you're calling it a time of blossom. Yes, first the blossom, then the doom. The blossom because you have to become the fruits. And once you have become the fruits, the rest is useless, is thrown away so that you can call as a doom day. But first God must give us, give you complete chance to be the flowers, to be the fruits. Isn't it? In His compassion. The students who gather around you, as you call them, your spiritual children, are they of different levels of capacity or can all of them receive this realization and transmit it to others? All of them. All of them can receive. As long as you are a human being you can get realization. But there are sometimes very complicated people. They have had attacks, they have had physical problems, mental problems, emotional problems. There are special category, of course. There are some people who are a special category. Maybe you may not find that seeking in some people. But once you have established a quite a number of people who are realized souls, the others will follow them. So you feel that just being human itself, just having the human soul and the human body is enough for realization? Enough, enough for realization. Is that somewhat different than traditional Indian teaching? It is not different. But I am different, I think. Perhaps I am endowed with something special that I can do it in a better way, perhaps. So the karmic process of reincarnation and gradual preparation is being speeded up? Very much. But it was long time back when Christ came in. Actually nobody told us that Christ has come in India. That's the confusion about. The way they represented Christ, Christ was not like that. Christ came on this earth. His name is Mahavishnu in the Indian scriptures and He was to come to suck our sins and our karmas. And He's placed in a center called Agnya Chakra, the last center here, sixth, before entering into the, we can say, the Kingdom of God. This center was the most important one where Christ Himself established. And if He is awakened, He sucks in your karmas. This is already promised in all the Indian scriptures. They were waiting for this Mahavishnu to come. But the missionaries who went with the guns in the one hand and the Bible in the other, they never understood Christ. You see, I don't know what they were talking. And the way they talked about Christ, nobody could believe that it was Mahavishnu. But now when I told them it was Mahavishnu, they are all changed. Of course, that was Christ and He was Mahavishnu. He's already come, so you don't have to suffer. There is nothing like karmas. In Sahaja Yoga, if you can raise your Kundalini up to that and if Christ is awakened, He'll succeed for you. He's done it already. He's died for us, for this purpose only. It's a special type of a very special incarnation of the Divine vibrations itself. I mean, He is an abstract God who came on this earth. Tremendous personality it was created. He's all written down. Were you, what was your spiritual training as a young woman? What was your family background and when did you feel it? When did you experience that there may have been something special given to you spiritually? Oh, I am very ancient, you know, so I knew all about it since My birth. Since babyhood you had a feeling. Yes, I was quite, I mean, I knew all these things very well. Was there a particular time that it became active in you? Was there an experience of being called to your mission? You see, I took birth in a Christian family and My father was a very learned man. He knew 14 languages in Sanskrit and all that he knew. My mother was another very learned lady. And they were very dharmic, you can call them, very religious and good people. And when I was born My father himself told Me that you have to find out an en masse media, a media by which you can give realization to masses. Because if you start talking about God or doing anything like that, you'll form another Bible or thing like that, people may crucify you or do something like that. So if it becomes a mass thing, which I knew I was to do, but he also realized it, then only the solution is there. So you work it out in such a way that you enter in a subtle way into the human beings and try to find out what are their problems and permutations and combinations of their problems and how one can overcome it and how the Kundalini can work out in a mass way. So I worked it out. I went to all these fake gurus and all these masters, so called, to find out what do they do and how they work it out. I worked very hard. And then they came when I thought, now this is the time. So at what point in your life did you actually begin teaching, taking students or actually transmitting spiritual energy? Actually in 1970, on the 5th of May, this Sahasrara, the last, you can say, the opening took place. And after that I started. But I had only one disciple for some days. Like that, gradually it moved on. I could tell that You were speaking in Christian terms, in an unusual way. I could sense that You weren't speaking just as an ordinary Hindu. I mean, it's interesting that You were born in a Christian family. Of course. The, the, the, the... I am Hindu, Christian, everything. And You, You, You, You referred to Mohammed Sahib, I think, too. Yes, I was with him also, what to do. I was with all of them. So in, in, in previous lifetimes You, You, You... You know, with all of them. Yes, yes, with all of them, you see. I've, I've witnessed all that. That's how I'm such an expert on human beings, I think. The, the thing which, which I find remarkable about, about the way You're transmitting spiritual energy is that You, or the awakening of spiritual energy is that Your, Your students tell Me that, that they also become able to, to awaken the spiritual energy of another person. That should be the criteria for everyone, isn't it? If you do not get anything out of your, your guru, what's the use of having such a guru there, who just takes your money, does no work for you and gives you nothing? So what's the use of giving all the time? You must get some return. But, in the past great teachers have, have had only a few disciples who were strong enough to, to also awaken the spiritual energy of other people. It was enough, it was enough for them just to be able to, to transform themselves, where it takes great strength not only to transform yourself, but to, to be, become a, an ocean liner for other people to, to, to cross over the ocean. But that is always in nature also. If you see there's only one flower on a tree, then there are sometimes two, then there are ten, then there is a blossom time. You see the time is such, at this time I've come, and maybe something about Me also, which one should discover after Realization, isn't it? Are Your Mother and Father still living? No, they are no more now. I myself sixty years of age. You look so young, I'm really... That's a camouflage. My daughter is thirty-four now, elder daughter, and I have grandchildren. I, when we were in India recently, we were fortunate enough to meet with Anandamayi Ma, and I just heard that she passed away a couple of months ago. Hmm. What good did she do? You see, what I'm saying you should see to these people. She actually got hold of all the bureaucrats of India. I must tell you the facts as they are. And the bureaucrats, all those, recently I had one, her disciple who was a patient of angina, high blood pressure. I mean, one can't understand that with the spiritual life, how can you have high blood pressure? It cannot go hand in hand. A person who is a realized soul must have a low blood pressure, a peaceful personality, isn't it? This is how all her disciples come to Me, with some trouble, mostly with kidney troubles, with heart troubles. I can't understand, she couldn't even look after their health. What was she doing? At least the health of your children should be all right, isn't it? You call yourself Ma. What do you do as Ma is a Mother. At least look after your health. If a Mother can't look after the health of children, I think she's good for nothing. Are there any spiritual masters in India today that you respect, that you feel are? Oh, there are many, many of them. Many of them they come and see Me, but they live in the hideings, I should call that. There are many. I asked one of them to come here. He ran away in three days from New York, believe Me. Really, it was too much for him. He said, I don't know Mother, how are you there? He said, after twelve years you tell Me to go there, not now. He couldn't come, he couldn't stay here. He said, they don't understand spirituality, they only understand dollars. So it's impossible for him. They have no patience. One thing I've seen, they have no patience with human beings. They are cut off perhaps, too much. But they are true, they are true, it's no doubt. They are not in the market. They have suffered, one of them suffered so much. His legs were paralyzed, his head was broken. His eyes were paralyzed, his hands were broken. And he does not know how to go about, so he has one tiger. On the tiger he writes, because he says, it's better to be on the tiger, so at least human beings are afraid of the tiger. We have many. Since you are a master of Kundalini, I would be interested to know what you are feeling about Shri Ramakrishna and Saharada Devi. He was a kind of a spontaneous master of Kundalini. Who Ramakrishna Parvansi? Not at all. Where was he? He gave Realization to no one, did he? He never gave any Realization to anyone. How was he master of Kundalini? He just played about with everything. You just listen to him, what he says. I will say Ramana Maharshi was, because he talked of the Self. But when did he? Ramakrishna was never. He was always in separation. A person who is in separation is not a Realized soul. It's a simple test. Anybody who thinks, Oh God, when will you meet Me? That means he is not a Realized soul. Supposing I'm in New York, I'm not going to say, when are we, am I reaching New York? If I'm in New York, I'm in New York. You see, you must use your brains in judging all the gurus. Ramakrishna, I would not call him, he was a devotee of Devi, is all right. That was all right. But he was not Realized soul. If he was a Realized soul, why was he crying and weeping and shouting and dancing? Mataji, thank you very much. I'm very honored to talk to you, but I think we should go. They are enamored by Ramakrishna now. What to do? What has Ramakrishna given to anyone? Just look at that. In all respect and love, this is the God. No, my child, you must understand, the people of Ramakrishna are suffering from cancer today. He suffered from cancer himself. This is the trouble with these people. It's better you are on the tape. Just tell me. Now what has Ramakrishna, he himself suffered from cancer. Now I cannot tell them the truth. And Ramakrishna, master of Kundalini, whom did he give Realization? Why are they so false? They are not honest people. Why are they so false? They are not honest people. Now what have I to tell them? Should I tell them the truth or not? You tell them. It has to be the truth. This is it! You see they don't want to face the truth. They are dishonest. I mean Ramakrishna has done no good, their people are suffering from cancer today. They are identified. You tell him, you tell him that I was there and why did you, you see they were all sick people. All left sided they have got cancers. What are they doing, why don't they understand these people? They are taking part, he's all right, he was a follower of God, he's all right. I didn't say anything against but he was not a realized soul, definitely he was crying. It's a fact, I mean you read it, he looks like a sick man himself, he died of cancer. Let it be now what to do. I mean it's impossible with these people, they are dishonest, they are dishonest people. But you can publish it Mother. In this case he may walk out but you can publish it, a magazine will publish everything you said and be very glad to have the article because people will read what they cannot stand the minute they get the impact of it but they will read it. And it will sink in and prepare the way by the written word. This is a fact, what I told you is a fact. You can read him, he's just trying all the time, where is my Mother, where is my Mother. What is there to follow a man who is not in realization? How can I support a wrong thing? What does it, it's nice to say good things about people to get them more into it but he cannot say this about Ram Krishna because people are suffering too much. They are sick, all of them are sick people, you go and see them because there are doctors, they want the doctors to prosper so they have to create sick people. If he had waited I would have told him, he should go and see what's happening to the Ram Krishna people. And first thing they get is cancer of the throat. He just walked off, see, he couldn't bear it. There are many who want to know the truth. All right, doesn't matter. So what is he, he was going to give it on the TV or something? Radio. Oh, it's all right because he's frightening. He should see. He will not now, he doesn't want to have it. There is a very strong attachment and feeling for the people that were a part of that particular lineage and he's done, he's invested a great deal of devotion in the direction of that activity. In where? Shri Ram Krishna and other people have come after him. That's it, he must understand he was not a realized soul, you see. Give him a bad man, let him realize it. He was not a realized soul, you see, because people are sick. Actually Mother, I was... You should have told Me about it. When I first met him, it was a couple of years ago, he looked like a fellow in his early twenties. He looked like a fellow in his early twenties when I met him just a couple of years ago and I was amazed to see him. He's looked at him? He looks sick? I couldn't believe that he changed so. I don't know how old he is but he looked... Imagine he said, I look so young. What about Ram Krishna himself? He used to look an haggard old dying man. This is the way they are identified. They are not honest, they should be honest. That's the main thing. They are not honest people. You see, the strength is honesty. If you don't have that strength within you, of honesty, you cannot stand the truth. That's the point is. You may telephone and tell him this, that you see there's nothing to be so upset about it because what Mother says is true. We have patience from him. Mother is curing them, she has to cure. He's not coming down here to cure people. Himself is sick. I didn't say anything. I mean if you can again say what is going on, just say. What did I say exactly about Ram Krishna? Let's re-see it. It's nothing bad. I didn't say he's a bad man or anything but he was not a realized soul, he was a factor. They have deified him. They have deified him in a way. They follow him. A person who is a realized soul must have a low blood pressure, a peaceful personality. Isn't it? This is how all her disciples come to Me with some trouble, mostly with kidney troubles, with heart troubles. I can't understand. She couldn't even look after their health. What does she do? At least the health of your children should be all right, isn't it? You call yourself Ma. What you do as Ma is a Mother. At least look after your health. If your Mother can't look after the health of children, I think it's good for nothing. Is it? Is it? Are there any, are there any spiritual masters in India today that you respect, that you feel are? Oh, there are many, many of them. Many of them they come and see Me but they live in the high books, I should call that. They have many. I asked one of them to come here, he ran a main thing from Iraq, really. He, it was so much fun. He said, I don't know Mother, how are you there? He said, after twelve years you tell Me to go there, not now. He couldn't come, he couldn't stay here. He said, they don't understand. The spirituality they only understand dollars. It's impossible for him. They have no patience. One thing I've seen, they have no patience with human beings. They have got all their hands. But they are true, they are true, they are not in the market. They have suffered, one of them suffered so much. His legs were paralyzed, his hands were broken and he does not know how to go about so he has one tiger. On the tiger he likes. Because he says, it's better to be on the tiger so at least human beings are afraid of the tiger. There are many. Since you are a master of Kundalini, I would be interested to know if you were feeling about Shri Ramakrishna and Saharada Devi. Shri Ramakrishna was a kind of a spontaneous master of Kundalini. Who Ramakrishna Paramahansa? Not at all, very much. He gave Realization to Rama, did he? He never gave any Realization to Rama. How was he master of Kundalini? He just played about with everything. You just listen to him, what he says. I will say Ramana Maharshi was because he talked of the Self. But when did he? Ramakrishna was never. He was always in separation. A person who is in separation is not Realized. So it's a simple test. Anybody who thinks, oh God, when will you meet Me? That means he is not a Realized soul. Supposing I am in New York, I am not going to say, when are we, am I reaching New York? If I am in New York, I am in New York. You see you must use your brains in judging all the gurus. Ramakrishna, I would not call him, he was a devotee of Devi, he is alright. That was alright. But he was not Realized soul. If he was a Realized soul, why was he crying and weeping and shouting and all that? I said thank you very much. I am very honored to talk to you with you. What did he say? I am honored to have spoke to you but we have to go. He is afraid. And he left at 10.47. 10.40 I think. Mother, when you have time, I have an interview all written. When you have time, I have an interview all written. We put it on a tape and we use it in the radio station in Boston. Is it? It's all done and if they can tape it for Me, then I have the answers on the tape. Alright, you would like to send this one or you would like to have another one? Perhaps both. Can they can the radio? You ask Me other questions, I think. Yes, I have My own questions. Yes, questions would be better. When should we do? You don't want to take a tape out of that. I can do it now, if you want to do it now, if you want to rest, I can do it later. No, why not have a tape? If you have to send it to Boston, then you have a tape ready. And they get them to come down and I said I would call them as soon as you came and we know how much time you had. Alright, we can do it now. It's good, you have more time to. I thought it was a wonderful interview. I don't understand if it is so fair. No, no, no, no, you see, he was trying to aiming at that, you see. But no, he came with that purpose. His void was horrid, his stomach was wobbling, completely wobbling, poor fellow was nervous, he couldn't look at Me. And left, left the machine and left to understand. It's a fact, you know, whatever I am saying, you see, if the disciples are so very sick, he himself is sick, that woman is sick, when he'll get troubles he'll come to Me, I know. You see, the problem of it is that there are these people that have the ear of the public are targets. You see, major targets and they are attacked regularly, you see, and what they think is spirituality is really something that is just invading them. Is what? It's allities? What they think is spirituality, what they think is real, is just something that's invading them in order to get the ear of the public, in order to get the attention of the public. He has a very large listening audience and so this, which is the mecca for the boots, you know, in this world but this country in particular, perhaps, his particular program is one voice that I would think the boots in the area would want to have silenced or at least under their control. There are He got upset when I said I was Christian, I tell you, because what Ramakrishna was, he was against Christians and specially Vivekananda was very much against Christianity and Christians and you know, just to outwit them he started this missionary work. You see, in the Hindu religion there is nothing like missionary work, is called as the worst of all, is the menial work. You see, he is not certain Brahmins, you see, this missionary work because the first concept is wrong that somebody is the other who to emancipate you are, you, if you are the Spirit then you don't have to help anybody, it is just you are part and parcel that you are helping, you see, so the whole idea is regarded as Shubra, is regarded as low, this is menial according to Indian philosophy, you see, and that's exactly started just like all the, if he had said here I would have told him all about it. He started this idea, this, what's his name, Ramakrishna of the missionary work but the one who really gave it a shape was his disciple Vivekananda. He started missionary things and hospitals and this and that, all kinds of things, you know, horrible people. They are extremely money minded, extremely gregarious, all kinds of problems they have. There's no transformation, nothing. Whom did he transform? I mean you must face it. This is the point. Now if this person, he got upset because I said I was born in a Christian family, I can tell you. They couldn't take it. They are against Christ. All of them are against Christ. They don't believe in Christianity as Christ, this thing, take it from Me. This is the reason. Is it a government radio he is operating? No, it's a listener sponsored radio. Is owned? A listener sponsored, he works on the station, it's called WBAI. Who owns them? The, it's owned by the people that's, that's supported. By the same people? By the public. By the public? It's publicly maintained. Is the public? Yes, the public sends money in. The government gives a very, very small part if anything now. Oh, sorry, the public is doing it? The public, yes. Now the, means a private man must be doing somebody who must have put in the money, must have started? No, actually they depend almost entirely on public contributions. But who is, I mean there must be somebody, we can do it now. It's good, you have more time to. I thought it was a wonderful interview, I don't understand, it could be so fair. No, no, no, no, you see he was trying to aiming at that, you see. But now he came with that purpose. His void was horrid, his stomach was wobbling, completely wobbling, poor fellow was nervous, couldn't look at Me. And left, left, left, left, left, what is the time? It's a fact, you know, whatever I'm saying, you see, if the disciples are so very sick, he himself is sick, that woman is sick, when he'll get troubles he'll come to Me, I know. You see, the problem of it is that there are these people that have the ear of the public are targets, you see, major targets and they are attacked regularly, you see, and what they think is spirituality is really something that is just invading them. Is what? What they think is spirituality, what they think is real, is just something that is invading them in order to get the ear of the public, in order to get the attention of the public.

You see, in the Hindu religion there is nothing like missionary work, is called as the worst of all, is the menial work. You see, he is not some done bramblings, you see, this missionary work, because the first concept is wrong, that somebody is the other whom to emancipate, you are, if you are the Spirit then you don't have to help anybody, it is just you are part and parcel that you are helping, you see, so the whole idea is regarded as Shubra, is regarded as low, this is a menial, according to Indian philosophy, you see, and that's exactly started just like all the, if he had said here I would have told him all about it.

They don't believe in Christianity as Christ this thing, take it from them. This is the reason. Is it a government radio he is operating? No, it's a listener sponsored radio. Is old? A listener sponsored, he works on the station, it's called WBAI. Who owns them? The, it's owned by the people that support it. By the same people? By the public. By the public? It's publicly maintained. Is the public? Yes, the public sends money in. The government gives a very, very small part if anything now. Oh, sir, the public is doing it? The public, yes. Now the, this is a private man must be doing somebody who must have put in the money, must have started? No, actually they depend almost entirely on public contributions. But who is, I mean there must be somebody who is in charge and this and that. But they have different managers. You see, then you can write to them that this man is a follower of Ram Krishna who was against Christianity, who was against Christ and that's why when Mother said it, he was upset. Why not write to them? You see, he must be having bosses also. He has free hand in what kind of program? Whatever it is but you can point it out that he's biased, he's not open minded. If he's doing public work. Not in that sense, not in that sense. He has a strong support for Christianity and mainline Christianity as far as that's concerned. He's had several purely Christian figures, Catholic figures as well as general Christians. Then why was he only because of Ram Krishna being criticized? Yes. So that means he cannot be a biased person. You see, in a democratic country you should give chance to everyone. He should have discussed instead of giving. In his mind Ram Krishna is synonymous with a perfect incarnation of God. All right, whatever it is but you can't use your mind for a public work. You see, you must give chance to everyone under a democratic country. It must be pointed out to the public somehow. You cannot, I mean he cannot propagate Ram Krishna. He cannot put his ideas into my head. I mean he is a public servant. You both have equal rights. In that situation you both have equal rights. Equal rights, he's a public man. If he's a public servant, he has no business. I think it should be pointed out to someone there, up there. He's above you. Who brought him here? You. I did not, I'm sorry. I didn't realize. When did he meet you? I never did. I just knew that he ran a radio program for seekers so I called him up and asked him if he wanted to come interview you and he said yes. So you should go and see his, his superiors and you should see he's got, he's having a thing for seekers. He is a person who doesn't take any money, has done so much good and she's saying something same and this fellow just left. Is this the man who's doing good to, why not go see his superiors? He's acting as a censor. Huh? He's censoring you. He's censoring a public. Was he? He's censoring you. He's acting as a censor. Cutting people off from part of the truth. Yes. His own president. He's not censoring. Yes, that's the point. He's censoring. He can't just do it. You see, you should, you should all write. Yes. You are all citizens of this country. You can all write. We have a big group of them in Boston and they are all sick. They have kidney troubles, they have hypoglycemia, they have almost every disease. You should write. You see, why not say, why not write that I was present at the, thank God you were all here and Mother was, never said anything against him but she said she, he was not a realized soul and Mother has a right to say that and he just walked off. How can he do it? It's better. To pursue the matter. To bring him down. You see, he may believe into anything. You may believe into ghosts. So what? Everybody has a right to say what they want. This is a free country or it's a, what sort of a country is this? If we had someone to introduce Mother, it would, it's the table. All right. Which? I'll have some water. But. Well, that's for the other end of the year. Yes, because it's a free country. Yes. It's a free country. Yes. It's a free country. Yes. It's a free country. Yes. It's a free country. Yes. It's a free country. Yes. It's a free country. Yes. But someone to introduce Mother. And then I could come after the introduction, so that they know where Mother is. What is he saying? Brian. Anyone, anyone need someone? Brian is all right, because he is not from the country. He is a good idea. Brian is good. But he's a free country. Brian could come. But he would be sitting here? All right? No, you sit here, because he will have to go away, won't he? After introducing. But he can sit there, just. What did you like about the way the introduction? He's looking rather worried now. He gets very angry, isn't he? You, because he's a journalist, that's why. You see why he's angry? Because his clan has mis-piailed. But they are all like that. I must tell you, horrible people. I mean he's a journalist, he's a public man. He has no business to have his own opinion. You see, very bad journalism. You better get a letter from him. Very bad journalism. You cannot be biased, you have to be a witness. That means he's trying to attract every one of them to his clan. If you are upset, let us some say something. You better introduce. He's looking so upset of this place. This journalist. I thought it was good to see, they're so afraid. They're so afraid when they hear the truth, because that's the reaction we've gotten in Boston. They're afraid when they hear the truth, especially about the false gurus. That's it. My, On the floor, on the right hand side, at the door. I'll give you the introduction and you can just add anything you like to it. It seems Mother this is not, this is typical in the sense that the usual outlets, the usual newspapers and so on, are really primarily interested in those areas of power and money. That is really what So that I can understand. That I can understand. That is the area that I think we've got to move into. No, no, that I can understand, but I can't understand this. That's what I can say. This is the other, where You see, you cannot, you cannot have your own ideas and your own identifications so much that you cannot bear anything else. It seems that people are are placed, these sort of people who have an interest They are, they are biased. They are a placed and They are placed and then of course the bias What you call them? A vested interest. Yes, yes. Wested interest, you see. Wested interest is the word. Mother, I don't want that. He left it by watch. I think he left it by watch. He left it, he took your watch. He was holding a hand. I hope he'll return it. He'll return, no doubt, but good, your watch has gone with him. It will do some good to him. He didn't even have a watch with himself. What sort of an interviewer he is? Now so, would you introduce? No, no, I would say that is he going to come in the film or not? Just now he is very upset and angry. No, no, I don't think it's just sound. It's sound, is it? Because if they like this then they can come down tomorrow and do it themselves with their own television. No, no, no. Now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, please, please, please avoid sound. I'll have some water please. Unless you are... Little warm. ...it is fine. It's all right, it's all right. It's the water here, thank you, thank you very much, thank you, thank you.

I have just now addressed your would-be husbands about how to make the married life a great success. I know that the women are more conscious of that, that they are responsible to make their homes, their families, their children and above all their husbands very happy. This is your greatest responsibility because you are responsible for the society, not men, men are not. They are responsible for say politics, economics and they make mess of that also. So society is left to you. You have to look after the society by being very tolerant, patient and wise and try to understand the problems of married life in a very philosophical way, like a witness. First thing is not to react. It is very common because this girl is coming from one family and going to another family. Now to her she is conditioned by her first family. Before marriage, whatever was his life, he is also conditioned. Now when she is entering into the new life, she has to get rid of that conditioning and become a part and parcel and also the complete governor, I should say, of their family. She has a very great responsibility. I think most of the marriages which have broken so far are very few, one percent are because of the girls or the brides, because they have funny ideas. They expect too much. Only you are on the giving point. You have to give as much as you can give, love, affection, understanding and a complete wisdom expressed in your family land. If the family fails, I would always blame the girl, the woman, the bride. Why? Because it is her realm. It is her area where she rules. She rules silently. She doesn't dominate. She doesn't try to drag people into troubles. But what she does is to make the whole thing beautiful, happy. She never loses her sense of humor. And try to understand that you are really at a very, very important position. It's not just a marriage as they have otherwise. It's a Sahaja Yoga marriage. And in Sahaja Yoga marriage you have to prove that you have been very good wives and you have been able to look after. The side that is very important is the spiritual side. If you are not spiritual, you cannot marry in Sahaja Yoga, you know very well. And once you are spiritual, what you have to see that you enjoy every bit of your marriage. If you think that you are going to make yourself miserable and make miserable everyone, you are stupid. That's what you are. But you have such a good chance it is to make others happy and yourself also happy. If you want, you have all the help from all the other Sahaja Yogis also. Husbands are very easy to handle. I personally think if you use simple things of very sweet attention that they love. It's very interesting sometimes how you can manage your husband so well. For example, I'll tell you recently, my husband bought me a very expensive watch. That watch was so funny that you could not take it out. If you take it out within six hours, you had to wear it. I said even to see six hours you have to have a watch. Now how to correct him was the big problem because he had got it with great love and everything but I can't wear a watch throughout the night. It's a very heavy, big watch. Spent so much money. So I brought one big plastic bag watch from my own daughter and I took it to the table and put it down there. He said, why this watch? Because to see if there are six hours or not. So he started laughing. I said, see this watch is more suitable for you than for me. So you take it yourself and you can buy some sensible watch which I can use for all the time and it doesn't stop. He said this very cheapish type as it's all right for me. As long as it works as a watch, it's all right. So this is how you should really manage things wisely, humorously so there is no problem created. That is the wisdom. There is the wisdom in this, not in making yourself as a watch. There's another example I would like to give you. It's very interesting. It's about one Sahaja Yogini. She was divorced by her first husband. So there was another one who came and said, mother, she wants to marry me, should I marry him? I said, did you find out why she has divorced, why her husband has divorced? She said, no. I said, I'll tell you. You see what happened that she was all the time saying to him, I had a very bad childhood, my father was bad, this, that and something was wrong with my mother and how I suffered and all the time she used to cry like that. She got off right. She said, really? To me also he's telling the same thing. I said, no, be careful. She will start her story again with you and then you will come with a divorce. So I would say you better sit. No, no, no, no, I don't want to marry such a miserable woman. If she's that miserable, a mother, I better be without her. So this is what one should understand that you just go on repeating about your busieries and troubles and this and that. So the husband would run away. You are there to make him happy and not to make him miserable. All right? If you understand this point, I think I'm sure you are real Sahaja Yoginis who will work it out that way. You see, to get miserable is very easy. It's a drama. It's a drama, one place. But you never win sympathies with that. You see, no one likes a crying person. Because I've seen people when a bride is come like that, when they see her coming, they all run away. All the children will run away. Everybody runs away because some miserable creature is walking in. So nobody wants to hear any tragedies. So don't have to tell any tragedies. Secondly I've seen also that there are some girls who go on telling, I had so many love affairs. There was such a boy, this, that. It's all nonsense. It has no meaning. It's a life that has changed. Your duty is to see that your husband and family is happy. Otherwise I would take no interest in such a hopeless marriage. So not to go and boast of it. Or secondly, that if the husband stupidly tells you, I was in love with this girl or that girl. Mostly it's a drama, I tell you. Just to have an impression on you that he's very much wanted. So be careful. If he tells you a story like that, you say, it's all right, now we are married, so we are husband and wife. Let's enjoy life, you see. So he'll be all right. So all these frivolous nonsensical things you'll face in life, don't pay any attention to them. I've not told them but I wish I had told them not to tell all these stories of their past life. Past is finished, now for you it is the future. How you work out in the future is the main thing. How you work out your own future shows your intelligence, shows your understanding, shows your love and also your such personality. So I expect from you all that kind of wisdom and understand. Men are very simple people, you don't know they are just like children. You should know how to handle them, that's all. They are the simplest things you could get. You see it's difficult even to manage a horse or a dog but men are the easiest if you don't rub them on the wrong side. All right? Another thing is that many women have a habit of finding out like a detective what things he has got, how much money he has got, where does he go, all that's not important. Not at all important. You should not be detective on him but you should behave in a way that should show complete understanding and complete faith in him because he is a Sahaja Yogi. You would have married from say non-Sahaja Yogi so what would have happened? God knows anything could have been but now you are marrying a Sahaja Yogi. Try to respect him because he is a Sahaja Yogi and unless and until you really follow the principles of Sahaja Yoga he will not respect you. I don't know if I should mention this to you but in my experience I have seen some women don't like anybody to come in their house. They don't want any outsider to come. In Sahaja Yoga is not enough. If there are Sahaja Yogis you have to look after them, to do whatever is possible for them and to entertain them. But not only for one particular person. For all of them you must have the same love, same respect and same relationship. It's very important because if you get favorites then there will be problem. You should have no favorites and this will work out so well you don't know. I have known people where some of the Sahaja Yogis would go to their house and they wouldn't go to another house so I said why? They said there is a tiger sitting in that house Mother. She is tiger sitting? Yeah there is. She really starts shouting and getting angry. I don't know why they behave like this. There is no sweetness about it. See what is most important for a husband is how sweet you are, how helpful you are and how kind you are. That's the main thing. Not how you look and all that finishes in three days time. After that they never see your face, they are not bothered. So to understand their need is that you should be very sincere, very affectionate and very kind. Now if any one of you think that they do not want to get married better tell me now. Instead of after getting married then I am in trouble. If you then want to have a divorce I must talk about it. Then you better have it now. And even if you want to have later on we will throw you out of Sahaja Yoga first. Then you can go and fight in the courts. So now you are wedded in Sahaja Yoga and you are committed to all the Sahaja Yoga disciplines of being very modest, kind and chaste. May God bless you all. So I bless you all with all my heart for a very happy married life and you should be determined to show your proper understanding of Sahaja Yoga. Now anybody who doesn't want to marry please now come up and say that I don't want to get married. All right. So one by one you all have to come and put like this kunku and akshata and these flowers on these slippers made of silver.

You all know Kumar and his name is Dhananjay. It's a very wonderful name, I must say very few people have this name. And his younger brother is Mote. His elder brother also has come. He is very good at tabla. And of course Dhananjay seems to be getting inspiration from the Divine. And the way he played all those things were really so wonderful. He is very young in age. He started playing they say in the Andha Arbonium from the age of four years and very fond of Baba Mama and Baba Mama was very much fond of him. But sometimes you know people play politics, they use that and he didn't come for some time. I was surprised. I am very happy he could come and he could enjoy his music and his whole system. It's so wonderful that how many instruments he can play at the same time. Now this one was the last one, was something of a very great musician, Bade Gula Malakasa. We have heard him but not you people because we are old and you are all young so you may not be. He is no more now. But he was a great master, great master and so much lost in his music that while singing he used to raise all his body upward and again go back and in the beginning we felt Baba this is too much of an exercise. But the way he had mastered this Indian music was remarkable. We had such great musicians in our country and that art sort of died out with these great masters. But again I am happy that it has again awakened in the people the greatness of Indian music and it's working out all over the world. Now she played Shree Shree. He was so apt because tomorrow is the wedding and Avinash is going to announce the marriages. going to announce the marriages. So it's the very right time because at this time it's auspicious to play sha'enai. So it's something so synchronizing. I think mostly because of the atmosphere is so much charged with the marriage announcements that he must have got the empathy, the inspiration. So tomorrow as it is we have to arrange certain things for you. There's going to be a haban in the morning and then next day is the marriage ceremony. Now this marriage ceremony is alright but the problem was the marriages I decided about five, six days back were only forty and then the marriages, marriage distinct came with the people and it was impossible to make selection. So now we have about I had done forty but they say now we have ten more and ten more for the what you can call the pre-marriages. Whatever it is I have to again request you that please don't behave like small children. You are grown up Sahaja Yogis. Try to understand how can Mother do this. Last minute if you bring all these things and in a hurry I don't know there could be so many left out. Apart from that so many could be wrong. So I request you not to be such a people who don't understand the value of these marriages. Last minute if you approach what will happen? I was doing till ten o'clock in my room. So you must have some consideration for Me also. They never used to do like this. Suddenly the speed has come. They always used to give Me time to decide. Now this time I don't know what happened that hardly any time was given to Me and now there are sixty marriages that are being split. I hope you have sufficient sarees and quotes because you have to be responsible. This is the one point you don't understand that we have to be responsible people. That is something still lacking that people don't understand their responsibility. It's now for years together you have been project and you have to be responsible. So please from next time any marriages come after six days I will not organize. I am also, you see, I have also limited time. There are always only same number of hours in one day. It doesn't increase. But this shows sheer childishness, sheer childishness. It's all right we have tried to work it out but next time I hope you'll understand and the leaders should not send those applications to you. I think I'll have to put down My foot somewhere now. Should not. Leaders must understand that things must be done at least six, seven days. You must have that much mercy for Me. I am not paid for any. So please try to reduce the pressure otherwise three days I'll be sending only in these things and what about the programs? So those who have sent the applications very late are little bit left out. But still I said tomorrow I'll try. But maybe it is difficult. I'm sorry I had to say this because I can't understand how you can be that irresponsible. Moreover those who have been in Sahaja Yoga for two years should only apply. That is one of the compulsory things. But all kinds of people apply. Even if they have been for six years, how much they apply, it's too much. Because that is one of the conditions that you should be at least two years in Sahaja Yoga. And that your leaders must give proper information about them. I can't understand that the people who are getting married could be so irresponsible. So may God bless you, all of you and please remember what I have requested you to do. Thank you very much. Thank you.

It's such a great pleasure and tremendous joy to hear Anand play so beautifully. When I came from Nagpur, his wife was on the plane. I was very happy to see him there. And I asked him, what about your program to Ganpati Puri? He said, perhaps it is cancelled. I said, why? Because of this earthquake, the people were saying that we may not be able to have any program. I said, you bring your flute and we'll organize everything. But this was the, I say, I don't know why this kind of a thing was there, that you could not have any program because of the earthquake that we had. But I don't think we had any problem here. We just, all of us, had the great pleasure of having all kinds of music. But specially for Anand, I feel he's, I don't know what to say, but he's such a genius, I mean, such a genius. I knew his grandfather and also his grandfather's guru. And I must say that such a unique talent he has, not only that he has taken, of course, because he comes from that family, as we call it, Garandhas. But the talent he has is to, whatever he has learned from his grandfather or from his father, to make it so melodious and so beautiful. Every, every time he plays something new, never repeats. It's such permutations and combinations, one after another comes out of his mind. I don't know if it is mind or what it is. I mean, the whole family is known to be a very, very great musicians, no doubt. I mean, world famous musicians. I have told you the story of his grandfather that My own brother was once down with typhoid. And he couldn't speak. After that we thought he might lose his voice. I tried search but we didn't work out with him. So just I asked him, what would you like to hear? Which music? So he took the name of his father, Panna Lal Ghosh. I mean, that's the first word he spoke. I mean, this music is so great that it can make, as Shri Krishna has said, Mookam karo tiva achaalam. It makes a deaf and dumb person to speak and to hear. That's what I felt at that time. It was long, long time back. I must have been about hardly 15 years of age. But that time I did feel that this music, Indian music, has that capacity to capture vibrations and to be effective. Now he just kept a spell brown, the Chitravataset Hari, as they say. Because of this, specially this instrument that we have, is such a charming instrument. Krishna used it and is made out of a very simple thing from the bamboo. There's no additions and no decorations, nothing. Simple bamboo. And it is very much symbolic also. I feel I'm, in all the instruments, I enjoy bhasturi the most. Maybe I have some sort of a conditioning, maybe I don't know about it. But it is symbolic also. They say once Shri Radha felt jealous of Shri Krishna. More of his murli is this bhasturi, flute. And she said, why is it that you always put it to your lips? Why? What is so great about her? He said, you better go and ask her. So he went to the flute and asked, what's so special about you that you are always at his lips? How is it that he always puts you to his lips? So the answer was very remarkable. The murli said that actually I am nothing, I am absolutely hollow. I am no more there. He is playing, everybody says he is playing murli, but actually he is playing, he is the player. He is the doer. I am just hollow, no ego. And this is very significant for Sahaja Yogis, that we have to be your hollow personalities if you want to play your vibrations for yourself and for others. So this is the most melodious, the most, I should say, unassuming type of an instrument, which doesn't give you any hangs up. Very, very simple, soothing. And when played through a great ananda, I really feel so joyous about it. I hope you also all enjoyed it. We are all floating in the air, I think, with that. We are all very fortunate that he brought his murli with him to entertain us. And this is much more than entertainment, it's much higher, much more valuable. I've seen his, all reciters we had, even in Kabela, are really memorable. He has been asking for his cassette, but so far Austrians have not been able to give me his cassette. So I would request them to please. He has asked for nothing, just for his own cassette, but so far he hasn't got his previous ones or even of this type. So I would request the Sahaja Yogis, who are recording him, that they should really give the cassettes. I always had told him that we try to sell some of your cassettes only to Sahaja Yogis, who appreciate your work, but not much of a profit, just for them to hear him again and again. So give him a big hand for giving us such a nice time. Thank you.

I wish I could translate all of them, but the last one I'll just tell you what it is about Namadeva. Namadeva went to meet who was a tailor as you know that one, the one who wrote our, I don't know, the Jogwa, you know the Jogwa, all of you or no? So he is the one who wrote this Jogwa in the 16th century and there was another great saint who was a, he is just a man who was doing some work with a clay, what you call that? Picharman? Like a potter, like a potter, yes he was. Both were great saints. So his name was Gora Kumar. He was a tailor, he was a potter. He went to meet this potter and this potter was kneading the clay with his feet. Suddenly he saw this great soul of a potter and Namadeva has sung the song that I came here to see the vibrations in the sense, Nirguna means something that is formless, but here it is in the form. Only a Sahaja Yogi or only a realized soul can appreciate another realized soul. This is, nobody can say such a thing that I came here to see just the formless and here Nirguna is without form and here he is in the form. See the appreciation. This is only possible for us realized soul to appreciate another person. One another, sentence I like this.

It has been such an enjoyable evening and that we got to see so many talents among Austrians and Germans. It was all not known to Me that they are really so talented. They are Austrians, some of them were English and as you say it was an international group of people who worked it out. This talent is, I don't know, after Sahaja Yoga it has prospered or whatever it is, but is extremely beautifully expressed with all the decency, with all the humor and all the dignity. This kind of protection of art is very important today. As you know what's happening to our creativity in this Kali Yoga. This shows a proper trend of mind where we are going now as Sahaja Yogis. We have to produce something that really entertains the spirit. Even the satire on the modern life was extremely, I should say up to the point, because I have faced this kind of talk and I know what they talk. It was really very realistic. The drama was very deep and the dancing was really lyrical. I must say the Austrians and Germans are known for their creativity and they had very great musicians, artists and they care for art. But as the time is moving you find such vulgarity, obscenity, indecency that gradually everyone who are trying to create something are taking to these methods which are very cheapish, which has no depth, which has no meaning, which has no message. And this is what we have to do is to give the message of salvation to the people of modern times. I was so overwhelmed by the whole creation and they were very, I must say, extremely methodical as they are, the way they were handling the stage. I also have acted on stage many a times and had first prizes always, I must say, without any ego. This has given Me an idea that I must get a proper curtain for you, get it done, that it should be properly organized for a beautiful stage. I have lots of ideas, let's see what works out. Now regarding this creation I can see how much they have put in to practice it and to work it out because these dances are not so easy unless and until they are practiced. With what dedication they have done it. I would like to really congratulate all of them for putting up such a nice show in such a inadequate atmosphere. There are so many things still missing in Kabela, I know you have to go through lots of difficulties and the way you tolerate all that and the way you are going through it, it's very remarkable. It's really Spartan. Just in the beginning we had nothing, we have something now and gradually I'm sure we'll make a very comfortable place for all of you. But in any way you have created a paradise here and I'm really so grateful to you because it gives Me, I don't know what word to use, it's not satisfaction, it is not joy, it is not something I feel emancipated. But sort of a feeling of flowing into your being My love, My compassion. This is a very unique feeling which is beyond every kind of words that you can describe. I'm happy you all enjoyed it very much. I won't be able to name people separately who have acted or done anything or played any music. I congratulate all of you from My heart. May God give you more creativity, more patience and more depth so that we create a new world of holy auspicious atmosphere. May God bless you. Now the last but not the least is something I have to do also. For the Sahastrara day I have some presents for all the leaders who are working so very hard and who are doing so much for Sahaja Yoga. It's not a very big present but just to express My love as you have expressed your love, something. Also last time we couldn't give any presents. I gave some but not very good ones to the Austrian ladies because they were lost. We couldn't find those things that we had. Kept for them they were lost somewhere. But now we have to write some. I hope it will be all right for all of you to enjoy it. So for the, especially today I must mention Gregor. Because when he went to Astria he told Me, this is the most boring place you could think of. And the people are extremely boring. And on the street when you come in the night you see a horrible people standing, horrible ladies standing on the way. So I am really fed up, Mother, I don't know what to do here. I said, Gregor you find more Sahaja Yogis, impossible, he said. And today we see so many Sahaja Yogis. So we have to really congratulate him for getting so many Sahaja Yogis there. Secondly he was so much enamored by Rajesha. And asked Rajesha what is it about. And so the generator of all this movement is really Rajesha who put ideas into Gregor and wherever he was transferred he just enlightened the whole place. These two persons are very important for Sahaja Yoga, the way they have worked it out. I came to first time when I came here. I came with Gregor's wife to Italy and we, I had to put the posters and everything and not a single soul came for the program. The one who came was Guido who really has done so much to lift the consciousness of Italians. This have come up so well also, it's very remarkable. Also we have here world leaders who have done so much work. And I think I should first honor the world leaders and then all of you can see the other world leaders also can get something. So first we give it to Rajesha. Second to Gregor. Third one to Gregor. Dr. Spyro Damnined. Stephen Taylor. Now, uh.. need we'll read the names of the readers who would like to give these boxes where I've shown as a strata being opened out.

After this joyous ending I don't know what to say, I was just enjoying the beauty of this rippling joy, something which cannot be described, you see. It is so spontaneous and so beautiful, the feeling of oneness, like an ocean, ocean of enjoyment. You see all the waves and the ripples. Just I can't believe that such beautiful things can happen to human beings. They are with such closed minds normally. I was watching the match because you are thinking of the match. I found it did not create love, it did not create oneness. On the contrary people developed kind, affect, very great aggressiveness. Apart from that aggressiveness it was kind of a hatred for the other party, I mean. I was wondering this match is played for what, it's a sports and the sport of love is this, where we all become one, we don't try to find faults with others, we don't aggress others, just enjoy everybody's rhythmic movement of enjoyment. This is so peaceful, so joy giving. While if you watch the match, I've been watching myself sometimes, I feel such hatred is emitting out of them. So because the whole thing is now money oriented, if it is money oriented it becomes a kind of a very aggressive game in anything, in tennis or this. In our times whatever sports were played were out of joy. We at least enjoyed them. But what do you find, neither the spectators nor the players are really enjoying it because they take one side. Now if you are from Holland you take Holland side, another one is from Belgium, you play from Belgium side. At least this kind of a combination should not have been there because they are so close see supposing the Holland losers or the Belgium losers, they start fighting among themselves very easy to fight, it's across the border. They could have made these games much more enjoyable if they had really had as was said a teams which are selected from all over the world, from different, different places. That would have been much better. But when I see the way they kick the ball, every time they kick the ball the ego goes back, another they kick the ball, ego goes back. It's a very dangerous game but normally it should not happen, normally it should not. If a child kicks the ball he doesn't develop a hatred. But because of this money orientation, this kind of a, you can say a Maya, that people get lost and they start hating each other for that money that they are going to get. While ours, our sport is love oriented, is compassion oriented, actually the love. To enjoy this Divine love is the greatest blessings and I'm so very happy to see that all of you have been enjoying it. Money orientation comes when you are living with falsehood, like you have seen so many false gurus and people, they are so money oriented. They don't bother about anything about compassion or love. They suddenly start thinking that they can make, they can befool all the people. Here there's no befooling but enlightenment, openness, awareness, to feel yourself and enjoy yourself. It's so nice to see so many of you, My children, dancing like this, so beautifully, in such rhythm. I mean the way they are making kawali also shows how global you are becoming. Can you imagine this Belgian and these Hollanders, Dutch people would ever sing a kawali? They composed it and then they put the tune to it and sang so well in complete rhythm and in tune. Normally I have seen the people from the West cannot sing anything in tune much for a longer time, afterwards they go out of tune. So I was surprised that, and they are not professionals. And what we call the Alap, Tan, that was done by our Shri Ganesha here sitting, was wonderful. I was amazed how could they take out these beautiful notes, what we call Swaras. It's really amazing how you people have really absorbed the essence of beauty of music also from all over the world. Your Kabela is of course filled with love and affection, no doubt. But it's everywhere I felt the same thing, whether it is Holland, Belgium, India, such love, I don't know what I've done to you, that you are so beautifully enjoying yourself and others in such a simple manner. It's something really very beautiful. I must congratulate the organiser, I was surprised at you and very much surprised the way you did the whole thing, Muse and all that, and the way he sang also. All of them have done such good thing. Moreover the composition of the Spanish people was also very remarkable. First I used to see Spanish dances. I always felt it's very sensuous type. I never felt that it had this beauty of expression of divinity. But now I find they have that Divine understanding of rhythms and the way they were playing, you see it's that only the Divine joy was emitting through them. Otherwise it's nonsensical to do things which are degrading to us. Normally if you find in the West when people join together, whenever they join together they become collective, they just start thinking of something destructive. Either they will go for say so called drinks or for some sort of a drugs also. Holland is full of it. Drugs or even beating each other, calling names, abusing, this, that. I don't know why this tendency is there when they get collective. But in our collective we become so beautiful that we start singing the praise of the Divine. It's something never heard of, I tell you. I have seen people who go to church also, after fifteen minutes half of them disappear. Then afterwards the thing is over, they come and say, what a boring thing it was, you see, fed up with this, that. And some people are just flirting with women or women are flirting with men. There is, I never saw them with such purity that they were enjoying their Ganesha principle. It's really remarkable how you all have changed, very, very remarkable. And I especially feel for Holland where I've been long time back and I was surprised at them the kind of things they used to do in their fields and things. I could not believe it that they didn't think of Divine love so much as they should have because they were all farmers at that time. But they were very much busy with making money, how to get from Japan, from this, that. Every person at that time, I was surprised, was just busy how to make money. And they didn't know much also. When we went there they put a Pakistan flag on our table. We told them, we are not Pakistani. Oh, not Pakistani, then what are you? I said, we are Indians, all right. So they brought another flag which was not Indian flag also. I was surprised. They didn't know anything and they didn't know why this kumkum is there, nothing of the kind. They were very good at making cheese and butter and things like that, but specially their flowers. It always happened that whenever I went there, specially the beginning it was hundred years or something of gardening or whatever it is, I saw the most beautiful flowers in all. Living with these flowers only, it's really I was thinking what a place it is, the heaven on Earth. But then when I saw the people they never tried to feel the beauty of the flowers. They only tried to feel how much it will cost, how much they'll be selling it, what country they'll be selling. So this new dimension into which you have come is so subtle and so beautiful and such transformation. Because I've seen those days also and now I see you here, I'm really absolutely flabbergasted. I don't know what to say, I just don't know. It is such an achievement on your part really that you have become so pure, so beautiful, so wise. You are growing very fast. I know Spain has few Sahaja Yogis. Spreading Sahaja Yoga is not the point. Going deep into Sahaja Yoga is that what you're doing. If I go to Russia I can get thousands of people there. If Spanish people are deeper than others, that is much better. Going deep into Sahaja Yoga is much more important than to spread it. Just go on spreading to all kinds of people is not going to help us much. What you have to now know that we must have very, very deep people who will join with us. Also one must remember that there are very few places in the heaven. So how can you get all kinds of animal, beastly people into Sahaja Yoga? We have to understand that people who are deep, who are really, who are really the instrument of the Divine and that they are extremely loving, compassionate, not showing off, not trying to do something, that is ugly according to Sahaja Yoga. So all has to be very beautiful relationship with each other, helping each other, understanding each other and also enjoying each other. We have here people from all over the world, always we have them. But you don't feel that way. Feel the whole global community that we have from all over is great. Next is our Guru Puja where lots of Russians also come here. I must say Russians are very deep Sahaja Yogis in such a short time. I mean you all are deep, very deep, but in such a short time they have become deep, is a very great thing that they have become so deep in such a short time. Whatever is the reason, what we have to understand that anybody who wants to be enjoying it deeply from the heart has to become matured and then only this enjoyment becomes complete. I'm very happy today to see you all here enjoying this music and enjoying all that was created by these three countries, so beautiful. May God bless you all. Thank you very much. They want to sing some bhajans. So I think we'll have an interval for about five minutes or so or ten minutes, whatever it is, and then we could have the bhajans. What about your food? Forgot number. We could have it for one hour more, some bhajans, all right? May God bless you. Till then you arrange, I'll just come.

Welcome to Ganpati Puvee. It suddenly got cold and I think you should be all careful about it, not to expose yourself too much, especially in the night. Be careful. Today's program is first to announce all the marriages fixed. We have already announced so many marriages and so many were not fixed. We tried to do the last bit of it and it will take about half an hour only, but whosoever is called, please stand up in your own place, need not come down. We tried, you see, very difficult to have an international marriage. So we tried to match as far as possible with their heights, with their education and with their looks also. I hope you like our choice, but if you don't like, from today I'm telling you, please let us know that you don't want to get married or you don't want to have a particular choice for yourself. It's much better to do it now, but after getting married, passing through all this ordeal, if you say no to someone, it's very hard because sometimes you are registered and lots of problems are caused because of that. We thought that all such people who after marriage misbehave or say no, will have to go out of Sahaja Yoga. We can't help it. Now you have four days here to decide, four days, and in that time if you cannot decide, then we can't help it. But don't say it's an atmosphere, it's somebody says, nothing. You decide on your own. It has caused us lots of problems so far so that I told Yogi that stop this marriage business. As it is, there are lots of problems in the choice also. So in such a short time, whatever we have done, also we must have made some misadjustments. I accept that. If you don't want to marry someone, you please tell us. We are not going to get angry for that or say anything. But understand that we have tried. Now there are some people, thirty-nine year old, suppose, and they want to marry only Indians. It's impossible. And under these circumstances we can't help you. If you put restrictions, of course we observe the restrictions, but in that case there's problem. So now we'll start. All right? Also those people who have been announced before, there were some girls who were missing, some boys they were missing. So also you can find out and try to match. Yogi has been working very systematically. He's working very hard and don't think that I have not seen. I have seen all of them, but still you must know that in such a short time to decide is very difficult. Thank you.

I am from Romania with Marion Svenk-Bacon from Germany. Chandrikanth from India from Nagpur with Olga Alekhina from Russia. Thank you. I think we have to start the music program now about these marriages. I'll tell you later on. But we have found out that Russian girls are the best as housewives, are very satisfied, I must say. They are not bothered as to how much you are earning, what you are doing. They are very satisfied and they can live with two, three sides. Very sweet girls, they are very good looking and also from other countries like Romania, Poland, they are very good girls. But I am surprised that Indian girls are very fussy and some of them want to know how much is the pay of the husband, how much he can earn, very calculating. So we have avoided such marriages, you see, because you have to fight your life in Sahaja Yoga. So many of you who got married before didn't have much money but you have more. You had faith and everything worked out well. So two extremes are there. Oooooooh. Oooooooh. Hello, hello, hello. Oooooooh. These are Indian songs in Indian languages. There are so many Indians who are sitting together here and there like groups. So I think that they should sit with other people one by one and explain to them what these people are singing. Then they will enjoy it more. I saw so many people were sleeping off. I think you must take rest in the day time. We have most of our programs in the evening. Tomorrow again we are going to have music, as Bhavamama says, from six o'clock, because I'm worried about your dinner now. And day after tomorrow, from nine o'clock in the morning, I'm sorry to say that, but there's price distribution only for Indians. The leaders of the Western countries and Australia and Eastern foreigners, I would say, should come here, the leaders, just to give presents to Indians. On the twenty-fifth evening there's a puja. We are organizing a very famous drama on Shivaji. There are two hundred actors and actresses in that. We'll try to arrange it here only. On the twenty-sixth and the kawals are coming on the twenty-seven. M. Rajam on the twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, weddings on twenty-ninth. In the morning we'll have haldi and in the evening the marriages. Most of the marriages have been fixed, but still I'm doubtful about one or two which will inform you. You better meet people, other people with whom you have been engaged. Try to find out all about it and then decide. Now there are three, four days. So I hope you do not make a mistake. Just talk to them. And I think you may, most of you will agree, but if you don't, don't hesitate. I'll be very happy. Don't leave it to Me. It's your decision. You shouldn't say, of course, if Mother wants, we'll do it. That I will never accept. You have to decide yourself, see for yourself. I've just given a guideline. It's no compulsion, no ruling about it. So you have to just see for yourself and decide for yourself. Thank you very much.

Hello, my name is Phem xu The guy from the Center for the State is Today's session will introduce the Rest sensitive Turkish people And our Web Chris are from Hong Kong Thank you Members of members of And with that I would like to invite Mahatma Gandhi. Finally, President Xi Jinping. and instructors Come... I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the very outset, we have to know that truth is what it is. We cannot change it, we cannot transform it. We have to feel the truth on our central nervous system. The word bone means you have to feel it on your central nervous system. From here comes the one who is enlightened. Also in Sanskrit there is a word called Vidar from where the word Vener has come in to go on your central nervous system. In our universal process we have come to this human awareness. Unfortunately you cannot know the truth unless and until you ascend through a new breakthrough in your awareness. So what is the truth? The truth is that there is this central system within you building your human evolution. Human evolution. And that once this power of Kundalini which is in the triangular bone rises, through appearances through your fontanel bone area, she becomes one with this alternating divine power of love. You see these beautiful flowers and it's a miracle but we don't think like that. You take it for granted. If you ask a doctor who runs your heart, he will say it is a autonomous nervous system. This autonomous nervous system is done by which doctor? He got answer that question. There is a power which is subtle, which we have never felt, which is of divine love. Which is all-pervading. This power does all the living work. So the truth is that you are not this body, this mind, this ego, emotions, intelligence, but you are the pure state. Because you say this is my body, these are my emotions, this is my opinions. Now who is this mind, who is this me? Now whatever I am telling you, you should not take it for granted. We have had lots of problems with blind things. Just keep your mind open as a scientist and keep this as a hypothesis. If it shows results, if it works, then you have to accept it as honesty. Because it is for the relevance of yourself, the relevance of your family, your society, your country and the world at large. At this human level we do not know the absolute truth. For example, I am sitting before you, you can see me sitting here, so there is no argument, there is no corner. You will only know the absolute truth when you will become the Spirit. So you have to understand that you are the Spirit. We have so many times ideologies, philosophies, but what we find is that it is not the ultimate answer. There is no peace in this world. We have no peace within ourselves. I have met many people who have got awards for peace, for organizations of peace. They are so back and forth and after work. You have to oppose them in the past school. I don't know how they got peace awards. So the first thing that happens to you is that you become absolutely peaceful. It is like you are standing in the water and you are afraid of the waves. But somehow if you can get into a boat you can enjoy the same waves. In the same way when you learn how to shift you can go down and save people from making drama. This is what happens to you that you are living on the thoughts of the past and the future. One thought rises and falls down, another thought rises and falls down. But if I tell you to be in the present you cannot. Actually the past has finished and the future doesn't exist. So when this Kundalini rises she elongates this first. She pushes her aside and the space is created in between. This space is the present. When your attention stays on this space you become thoughtlessly aware. You are aware, absolutely aware of her kindness. And the present is the reality. This is the first state you achieve. Then the second state you achieve which you call as doubtless awareness. Where you know everything about yourself, complete self-knowledge you get. And not only that but you become your own master. There you have no doubts about yourself. You realize you are a divine person and there is protection of the divine on you. This happens to people sometimes both stages at the same time. Tao is the one in that system. Tao has said the same thing. But I think the tradition is Tao lost. This is the same thing as Tao. Only thing was that time there were not so many realized souls. Now the time has come for you to know the truth. In these modern times there are thousands and thousands of seekers of truth. This is how many people tell you, you can describe. These modern times have created these beautiful seekers of truth. But they are saved by false people. These false people are nothing but truths because they want to make money off of them. The other day I met one gentleman who was sitting before me and he has been to South Gouru in Vietnam. I saw the materials. They had used all the chakras, the names of the chakras. You see, mistakes but they had used the same. He has explained all these things. They are not changing. They are not changing people at all. What is the copyright of the game? So you can't pay for it. How much will you pay to this mother for giving us these flowers? It's a giving process of revolution. Try to understand. So then we turn to religion. For example, Christ was a very, very pure soul and incarnation. But he was too mild. He never knew what sort of people he was facing in this world. So in the Bible, in the fifth chapter of Matthew, he says, if your one eye does anything simple thing, means if you look at a woman with bad eyes, take out your eye. If your right hand does anything wrong, then cut it out. I have been to all sorts of Christian nations. I have not let one who has taken out the eye cut his right hand. To follow Christ is not easy. One has to get an angel to follow him. But Christ never had an exclusive religion. He talked of the Brahma of Moses, of everyone. And then about Christianity, you can say, but he never said this is religion is different from the religion of Abraham or of Moses. And Mohammed Sahab also he talked of the Brahma of Moses, of Christ, even he called out religious successfully. Also he said there have been hundred and fifty thousand realized souls before him. Hundred and fifty thousand realized souls before him. Hundred and fifty thousand realized souls before him. So he never talked of exclusive religions. Of course he was also a great incarnation, so he thought only Christ has there to be well. And left it to human beings. Let it for the human beings themselves to cut their hand and take out their eye. So he asked others to do it. And for human he said any woman has bad eyes, should be well in half way, in the soil and should be big big souls. Think of American women, I don't know what would have happened. So in the democratic countries we have been then when every value system started and you have problems from that, lots of problems. You have licenses and consumers, any supplements for profit. Now, so the reaction to that was for that reason. So one side is complete licenses and another side is complete separation. Othi got a success. Once I was driving from Riyadh to England and I just kept talking. When I got up I found very different people, ladies with such small skirts and men very daddish. All smoking and drinking. So I asked the most people who are these people. She is the same as she said. They are going to London now, so they are going to London's life. With oppression they become even more immoral. So this is not the solution. From one extreme to another extreme you have to come to the middle path. Once you become a spirit you can come to that middle path, right? What about the way you become righteous, you become righteous? No one has to tell you, no one has to tell you. In England overnight people gave up drugs and said it. All your bad eyes just dropped. It's like this. Supposing I have a stain in my hand and I am very obstinate and it's all dark. I do tell you that there is a stain in your hand. I will not listen because because I am obstinate. But if there is little light immediately I will throw away the stain. That's what happens. In the light of the Spirit you become aware what is destructive and constructive for you. You become aware of the light of the Spirit. Then the light of the Spirit enlighters your attention. Your eyes become clear. And even a glance of such a person can be a peace or can cure another person, even the glance. These properties are remaining potentially there. Actually you don't know how to address them. You have no idea what will be interested in you. One has to have a personality which is known to him, is the identity of his personality. Now the another quality of the Spirit is that it gives you the absolute knowledge. Now how? If you stretch your hands on your fingertips you can know the centers of another person and your own self. If you know how to correct your centers you can correct the centers of others. These centers are responsible for all the problems that his government will do emotional exercise. If these centers are cured you can cure many things without going to the doctors. With your own power? Actually after that you don't go to the doctors. It is very simple to understand that all curative power is within yourself. In Italy there are three doctors who got their MD. For curing through Sahaja Yoga system. Many curative services are closed. It's power which is within us, why not use it? It is very surprising that a country like Russia has taken two Sahaja Yogas so seriously. They do not have any conditionings of any religion or materialism, no? They are not very good in the country. 65% of people in Russia are very very clean. 65% of people are very clean. And I would say 35% are very very clean. They ask for molecules, cigarettes or for genes. But the same people spoke in a speech and the same people gave a word. One of them said, so what? And one of them was given twice. I said I am not in any house but I was very shy about it. I said how can you give me the time stream? So the Vice President said, Mother what time stream has done? It's work not matter, you are working on human beings. Then the Russian government saw my work and asked me to be the Government and he said what? No other false rules are allowed. It's very remarkable how these people have taken the food. There are 2005 made doctors in Russia who are practicing Sahaja Yoga. I know also Middle East China has been four, five times. The people of Middle East China are the people who will take to Sahaja Yoga. They will take to Sahaja Yoga. Chinese have very big tradition of Islam. They are known for terrorism. They should know that when they are getting into materialism, there are problems that are created by materialism. But if you become the Spirit, your attention becomes so pure that you know how to earn better and be better. First of all, if you do this, now I'm 72 years of age and I'm travelling practically every second, third day. I don't have problems. In the same way, as I said, you jump in the boat and you see your problems and you can solve them much easier. Moreover, you become one with the Divine power, which is the most alert, most compassionate and efficient power. It protects you. It protects you completely. It guides you to Divine operations. But firstly, you must know you can become that. I have seen people come to My program and they just disappear. Actually I'm not foreign but they are faith in Me. They listen to Me and when we have somebody who are their own culture, I don't know what happens to them. In the beginning the starting of the sea decreases. But then you have to grow to be a king. It's like the parable of Christ when He says, some seeds sprouted but fell and washed it down, something like that. So you have to respect yourself guys. I say this because you are wise people. Americans are like babies, they are very immature. I think they will take at least 20 years more to understand. They run after all kinds of false people, waste their money, waste their living. Now there's a new guru has come. All those have been planning a nice discovery now. All are experts. Some people told Me this new guru has taken all their money, everything. So what did he do? He called one man from the audience and said, I can teach you how to control the mind of this man. He gave me a pendulum in his hand. So now I can make the pendulum go round and round. And the fellow started moving the pendulum round and round. This is stupidity to be impressed by such things. So I asked him on this earth, we have come to move pendulums. Is that what you are seeking? Why did you give him so much money? Now we can soon be impressed. I think I am not an American, there's no law, you can't say anything about that. And then they want to fly a few feet high like that. Or that they will pay thousands and thousands of pounds. Or why do you want to fly a few feet? We have already jammed some of the road. If you are for such stupid things, nobody can help you. Sir, the Lord is not meant for idiots. Those who have no respect for themselves, how can you work it out? It works very fast with people who earnestly want to have their self-realization. The greatest quality of the Spirit is that it is the source of joy. You are joyous with yourself. You don't have to fast, you don't have to leave your family, you don't have to go to the Himalayas. Sitting down here you can get your self-realization. But you have to have faith. You'll be amazed how much it helps you every day. For example in England there is so much of people getting jobs. Even when they get educated. But all the Sahaja Yogis are involved. They all have earned sufficient and they are satisfied. So now it will take hardly fifteen minutes for you to get your life accomplished. But I must confess I cannot force self-realization. Because I respect your belief. Those who do not want to have their self-realization can leave the world. But please don't disturb others who are not able to get their self-realization. But please don't disturb others when they are getting their self-realization. You won't have any problem, you won't face any difficulty and all of you can get your realization. All right. Now I have to tell you there are three questions, very simple. You have to sit down together. And as there are three powers you have to fulfill the three departments. You have to know that this power of Kundalini is the power of pure desire. All other desires from the realm are not pure. As you know the economic law that wants are not satiable in general. That is great that you want to have a house and you want to have a car and you want to have a helicopter, maybe a plane. You go on all the time asking for something else because whatever desires you have are not satisfied. So this is the only thing is power which is the pure desire whether you are aware of it or not. In this short lecture I am sorry I cannot tell you everything about Sahaja Yoga. But I request all of you to come to our follow up programs and grow with it. That means all your physical, mental, emotional and spiritual problems will be solved. What if you don't have to pay but you have to give some time to yourself. Now there are three conditions as I told you. The first one is that this all-pervading power is the power of forgiveness. So please forgive yourself. That means you should not please leave me at this moment about anything whatsoever. At this moment your past is finished and don't feel guilty at all. That means you should be pleasantly placed towards yourself. The second condition is that you have to forgive everyone. Not to think about anyone whom you have to forgive but in general say I forgive everyone. Many people say it's better to forgive. But whether you forgive or don't forgive you don't do anything. But when you don't forgive then you claim wrong acts. You tortured yourself and the other person who has trouble you is happy. You are tortured yourself. So please forgive everyone in general. The third request is to take out your shoes. I tell you this because in England first time when I asked them to take out their shoes the English walked off. So what's attached to their shoes? But in the Eastern countries people know that to be respectful we have to take out shoes apart from that. This one has such our problems. I will be happy to take out your shoes. So be pleasantly placed towards yourself. Don't be angry with yourself or with anyone. Now the left side as you must have told you is the power of your mundane desire. And the right side is the action, power of action. So we all put our left hand towards Me like this on your left thigh. Now we have to use the right hand for nourishing our centers on the left thigh side. So first put your right hand on your heart. Now in the heart resides the Spirit. If you become the Spirit you become your own master. Now take your right hand, left hand side of your left thigh. Now you have to take out your shoes. So now take your right hand, left hand side of your domain on the upper portion and press it hard. This is the center of mastery. Now take your right hand in the lower portion of your domain on the left hand. This is the center amazingly is for the pure, you have divine knowledge. Now raise your right hand upper portion of your upper. And now raise your right hand on top of your. Now raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and shoulder. Now turn your head to your right. This is the center goes into your body when you feel guilty. Then your heads your mind. Now you have the disease called spondylitis or angina. Also your other organs become retarded. Also cancer. So please raise your right hand on top of your forehead across. And put your head. This is the center for forgiving. For giving others. Now please take your right hand on the back side of your head and push back your head. Now here without feeling guilty. Without counting your mistakes. Ask, you have to ask the divine power for giving. Now the last center. Please stretch your palm for me. And put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area. Now please put down your arm. Here very important is to stretch back your finger so there is a good pressure on the scalp. Now hold your scalp seven times clockwise. Now please put down your arm. That's all we have to do. Now please put your left hand on top of your left thigh. Please put both your feet apart from each other. Now you have to close your eyes. Please don't open your eyes directly. Please don't close them tight. Just let them speak. Now please put your right hand on to your heart. Here you have to ask a very fundamental question about yourself to Me. You can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji. Please say in your heart, not loudly, ask a question, Mother, am I the pure Spirit? Please ask the question. Now if you are the Spirit, you become your own guide, your own master. So please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and press it. Here again you have to ask another fundamental question about yourself. Please ask Shri Mataji, Mother, am I my own master? Now I have already told you that I respect your figures and I cannot force your divine knowledge on you. Now please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Here you have to say six times, Mother, please give me your divine knowledge. As soon as you ask for pure divine knowledge, the Kundalini has started to rise. So we have to notice the higher centers with our true Self-confidence. You have to know all of you are going to get your Self-confidence. Be confident, Mother. So now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Now here you have to say full Self-confidence, Mother, I am my own master. Say ten times. With full Self-confidence in your heart. Now I have already told you at the very outset that you are not this body, this mind, this emotions, intelligence, ego and your conditioning but you are the pure Spirit. Please take your right hand on your heart and here you have to say ten times with full confidence, Mother, I am the pure Spirit. Now this all-pervading power is the ocean of knowledge. Is the ocean of compassion and love? Is the ocean of miracles? But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness. So what are you saying, Mother? You have committed in the past. Please forgive yourself. Now take your right hand in the corner of your neck and shoulder and turn your head to your right. Here you have to say sixteen times, Mother, I am complete. I forgive myself, Mother, I am not complete. I forgive myself, Mother, I am complete. You see at this moment if you don't say this, this center won't open and Kundalini won't be able to rise through this center. So you will miss such a great opportunity. So please say sixteen times. Now you can take out your glasses without opening your eyes is better. Now raise your right hand on top of your forehead across and down your head as far as possible. Here you have to say forgive everyone without thinking about them by saying, Mother, I forgive everybody. This center is one of the octogenical medical centers. You have to say it from your heart, not from your tongue. If you don't say, then this center won't open which is very important. I have already told you whether forgive or don't forgive, you don't do any. So just now please forgive is very important. Now please remember without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness from the All-Pervading Father. Now raise your right hand on the backside of your leg and push back your leg as far as possible. Here you have to say from your heart again, not from any talents, or do I come? If I tell anything wrong, you will be your unknowingly, please forgive me. Now the last center I told you to stretch your palm fully and push back your fingers and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area and now push down your head. Now push back here. Put down your head please. Here again I cannot force Self-realization. So you have to move your scalp seven times clockwise asking Me, Mother please give me my Self-realization seven times. Now I will give you a few more times. Now please come back. Open your eyes. Now put both the hands towards Me like this. Put the right hand like this forward and see with the left hand bending your head if there's a cool or a hot, just like vibrations coming out of your fontanel bone area. Now put the left hand towards Me like this. Now put the right hand on top of your throat. Now put the right hand on top of your fontanel bone area. Now bend your head. Now if you get it close, if you get it far, now move your hand. Now please put again one more to your right hand towards Me and bend your head and see for yourself if there's a cool or a hot, just like vibrations coming out of your fontanel bone area. Now please put both the hands up like that, tap your head and ask a question. Out of these three questions, any one of these questions, three times. What else is it a cool breeze of the Holy Ghost is the first question, ask it once. Or you can ask, Mother, is it the All-Pervading Power of Divine Love? Otherwise you can ask this question three times. Or Mother, is it Paro Chaitanya or Guru? You can ask this question three times. Please, now put down your hands. Please now put your both the hands towards Me like this. And watch Me without thinking. All those who have fat, cool breeze on their fingertips or on the palm or out of their fontanel bone area, whether hot or cold, please put your hands. All those who have fat, please put both the hands. Now, may you ask this question? You are not special, so tell me, how do you feel? I bow to all of you. Your safety life has started. Those who are not friends should not feel disappointed, in no way. You see, we have very nice center here and very nice people, very humble, who know everything about Sahaja Yogi. You will be lovely, sir. Here we are, have you got it? What's the matter, we have some other master? He is a master of all the world. That's it. So you come and get the clear out. See, these are all non-kind of people and sometimes they stop. All right? Not only they take money from you, but also the spoil your food away. What's the reason for that? I will be coming next year again, but before that I will make the request that you must look after your Self-realization. Now we have got somebody, a doctor from Austria and the Austrians have been personalized here. So I request you all to respect your own Self-realization and your own spiritual growth. Also if you have any problems, you can write to me. I would just now say that you enjoy yourself. Enjoy your Chai Sodor Chai Sodor Ching Hai, the incarnation of Ching Hai. May God bless you. Thank you very much. Thank you. May God bless you. May God bless you. May God bless you. May God bless you. May God bless you. May God bless you. May God bless you. May God bless you. May God bless you.

Why do we need the second table? I think one table is in the picture option, I thought she just came on this section. I think one table is in the picture option, I thought she just came on this section. I think one table is in the picture option, I thought she just came on this section. I think one table is in the picture option, I thought she just came on this section. The second room is still there. I think one table is in the picture option, I thought she just came on this section. I think one table is in the picture option, I thought she just came on this section. So tonight we have the honor and pleasure to introduce you to an exceptional lady for an exceptional evening. So, Shumanoshi will come in about 40 minutes. But before that, before she comes, we would like to tell you a little more about her and especially about the techniques that she has been developing these last 20 years or more. She is a woman who has been living in Australia for over 30 years. She is a woman who has been living in Australia for over 30 years. So when they say that Shumanoshi is an exceptional lady, I have to mention a few facts about her life. The first thing I want to say is that Shumanoshi is now 73 years old. But two weeks ago she was in Australia. And then she went to Hong Kong, then to Taiwan, then to Malaysia, now she is in Bangkok. And tomorrow, in two days, she will be in India. Sorry, maybe a little bit long for the name to translate. She is a woman who has been living in Australia for over 30 years. She is a woman who has been living in Australia for over 30 years. She is a woman who has been living in Hong Kong, then to Taiwan, then to Malaysia, now she is in Australia, then to Japan, then to Taiwan, then to Malaysia. She is a woman who has been living in Australia for over 30 years. So I have also to mention that Shumanoshi has a family. She has children, grandchildren, she is married. And she is from a very high family. But still at this age, she travels all around the world, so why? When I say that Shumanoshi comes from a very high family, I mean to say that, for example, the husband of Shumanoshi was the United Nations Director or General Secretary for Maritime Affairs during more than 15 years in London. And of course, whenever Shumanoshi travels around the world like this, she is not paid for this conference. And she will not take any money from you or from me for this conference. She comes because she has a message to give us. And so she knows because she has a message to give us. And this message is a very simple message, but at the same time absolutely fantastic. And this message actually is an experience, the experience of yoga. So Kundayini already translated in Thai, but yoga actually means to be in union with something. So in union with what? With the inner self, but also with the energy and whatever is around us. So yoga is not something that you can do, you don't practice yoga, but you can be instead of yoga. So some people when they phone us, they just say, oh, should I come and go jogging and basket? Or you know they just ask what kind of exercise we have. But as I told you, we don't do yoga. We are in this state or not. And Shumanaji would like you or this evening to start experiencing this state of yoga. And also some people ask us, is it a religion? Is it Buddhist? Is it Hinduist? Or what? But actually in India there is a saying that saints have no religion, they are both religions. So actually when I say that saints are both religions, it means that when you experience a certain state of union with yourself, this is the same thing that is described in all the religions, all the spiritual techniques or traditions we can say. So tonight we will not speak about religion or we just speak about something which is a state of well-being that you can experience, all of you, without believing in anything. This is a living experience. You can say, oh, now we are in the right direction. Or now here you are going a bit too far. Or this is not proper. So please make this kind of new sense. So just imagine that you have an energy within that starts to be awakened. This energy makes you conscious of your emotional state, physical state, in a much more accurate way than you could ever imagine. Just imagine a sign energy that also tells you about all the people, how they are inside. And also imagine that this energy can cure you but can also cure others. So to be more clear, I will show you this map behind. And you see on this map here three channels inside the body of the gentleman which is sitting in yoga. And in his body we have one channel on the left which is according to people who practice in yoga, the energy by which you feel things, by which you have the emotions, this is linked to the past. And you have another energy on the right side which is linked to the future, to your energy of planning. We can see the energy of the brain being futuristic, this kind of plan their lives. Tomorrow I have to do this, in ten years I have to do this. So we can see that I am not talking about the middle channel of the body of the gentleman, but we can see that you have two kinds of energy in human beings and Asian people know that very well. This is the yin and the yang. This is the female energy, the male energy, the past, the future, and the emotion, the action. So actually we are just living with these two energies and this is very difficult to be in the present. Because if you are in the present, means you are not thinking about the future, thinking about the past, you are just there in reality. And this, if you try to see within yourself, this is very difficult. Because it means also that you have to be above your mental activity. So actually we live in a world which is related, we can say. And let's say somebody is more on the right side. Let's say that this gentleman here, use more his energy on the right side. What does it mean? It means that in his life, in his everyday life, he will be more this kind of person which are very active, very logical. Everything they do, they are very logical. And with this, we can see this energy of planning and they are very active with their brain, but maybe they don't have feelings anymore. So if you are too much on the right side, you will be this kind of person who will be more like you. So if you are too much on the right side, you will be this kind of person who after his job, sitting in the car, once he has left the office, he is thinking about tomorrow, what I have to do, I have to do this meeting, he has to write this note, I have to start this project. It means that you are not in the present, but you are already in your worries about tomorrow, what you have to do in the next week and the next month. And of course, when it is time to sleep, you cannot sleep because you are still thinking about your job. So this is, we can see, of course this is a gross picture, but we can see that people who are more on the right side, the right side energy tends to be like this. So these people suffer, but they also may not be able to suffer because when we are too much on the right side, using too much of our brain, we can use our heart to feel what other people are, how they are, how they react. So we just like to, and we start to see only ourselves, we are more than ego here, this big little balloon here. So of course, you can imagine you have also people on the left side, and these people are people who just live with their heart. They have emotions. So this is very nice, but sometimes you can be also dominated by your emotions. What other people can tell you, even when they just respond, they may say, your boss is not happy with your job, or today, your project you gave me is not good. And this person will feel, oh, such a bad day, why he is not happy with me, and this and that. So we can see, over-indulging into emotions, people are dominated by their emotions. So we can see, over-indulging into emotions, people are dominated by their emotions. So of course, if you go too much on the right side, or too much on the left side, I mean too much on your action, on your brain, too much acting, or either if you have too much on your emotions, too much thinking about the past, lethargic, then some disorders happen and you can get sick, physically or mentally. So of course, the best would be to be more on the middle channel, and this is what the Buddhist people know that. We also know it in India, but it's very difficult to achieve. This is what everybody trying to seek meditation, trying to achieve, to be more in the present, not to go on the extreme. Because when you are, let's say you are not sitting here tonight, nobody, no one of us should have any problem. Because what problem is there tonight? Just sitting in a nice hall? So we shouldn't have any worries or any problem because we are in the present. I mean if we can be in the present, then there is no problem. So of course all this is just a talk, but what happens in Sanjaya is that you have an energy in your body here, which is named in Sanskrit as Kundalini. And this is a sacred energy. And when this energy rises, then you are above the right side and the left side, you can see. You can enter into the present very easily. And when this energy rises, then you also start to feel a deep feeling of peace and of compassion for others, but also for yourself. Because some people, whatever they do, they don't like themselves. But in Sanjaya, start loving others, start loving yourself and be in peace. You become a peaceful person very easily. And this is not a mental process. You will start to feel it. You will start to feel that this energy is raising to your body. And you will also feel, most of you will feel it on your hands here and on top of your head. You will start to feel like a cool wind, cool breeze coming in your head and on top of your head. And this is not a new thing. This is not a new knowledge. We will show you some slides later on. And you will see that on many stages, like many stages of the Buddha, there was this knowledge before. The only thing is that as this stage is very difficult to achieve, people now, they don't understand all these symbols that you can see on the stages of Lord Buddha. So, tonight we love to become Buddhas. I know everyone here is a Buddha, but what you will start to experience is that the same energy that is raising to Lord Buddha when he got his enlightenment starts to rise in you. Of course very slowly, not at the same level. So, this seems maybe a little bit mysterious to you, but one thing which is very important is that don't believe me, don't believe in learning, and don't believe in Shrimadaji when he comes. So, you don't have to believe, but you will try and you will see by yourself. Maybe it will work at first, I would say for most of you, but still you will need maybe one month, two months more of practice to really feel everything inside you, to feel this energy working inside you. So, what does it mean? It means that one energy will start to raise inside you, rise inside you, and then you will feel different things in your body. You start to feel, oh, maybe I am too much on the right side, means I am more dominated by my actions. And you will feel it physically, because you will feel that your right hand, which is linked with the right shoulder, will be harder, more harder. Or let's say that if you are someone who is not so self-confident, when this energy will rise, she will stop here, on the heart center. And you will feel a kind of pressure here, or maybe a kind of heat, very slight, of course it's not hurting. And maybe in your hands also, on this finger, on this little finger, because this is linked with this chakra. So you will feel it, but also you can start to clear that inside you. It means that basically for someone who will feel this heart problem, this insecurity problem, just by keeping energy, this inner energy that you have already inside you, by directing it to this center, you will feel much more confident and much more peaceful. And this chakra is linked with your emotions, but also with your bodies, I mean whatever. Let's say somebody is sick, had a heart problem, heart attack maybe a few years before, but you will notice such a again, you will feel that the energy will stop here, because this energy has to cure it, has to balance it. And you can feel it in others also. If at your job you meet somebody who is really a bit worried about one project or angry with you, you will feel it on yourself, on your head, you will just feel there is a pressure here, on this center, on this Adhyay Chakra. That's what we call it. You will feel it directly, you don't need to speak to that person, you know that there is a problem. And of course when this energy rises, she will help to open all these chakras and each chakra has a specific quality. So it means that basically all the qualities which are inside you but maybe not manifested yet, start to manifest themselves much more. But I will not go much more into details. It is just for you to know that, I mean not basically Shri Mataji is going to speak about tonight and what you can achieve through Sahaja Yoga, but the most important thing is that you will have to try by yourself. And it is also absolutely essential to know that you cannot pay to learn this kind of knowledge. You cannot pay for this even to have an insight. So I would like to say a few more words about Shri Mataji, who she is. So as I told you, Shri Mataji is Indian, it's an Indian lady. And Shri Mataji was born in a royal family in India. And now she is about 73 years old. She was born in a Christian family. This is something important. And in her childhood her parents were very much involved in the independence fight, the fight for independence of India. And Shri Mataji even as a child was regularly in the ashram of Mahatma Gandhi. And it is said that Mahatma Gandhi was recognized as a very special child and would ask her about meditation. And as a young girl Shri Mataji was one of the leaders of the independence movement of India for the young people. And then Shri Mataji studied medicine. And she had a very normal life in the sense that she married an Indian gentleman who later had this high career that I told you about. And it's important to say that Shri Mataji was born with this energy completely awakened inside her. But as many saints, she couldn't at that moment give or transmit this experience to other people like you and me who are not ready for that. And in 1970 somehow because it was the moment and also because Shri Mataji felt that there were so many seekers, of truth, of peace, of spirituality were misguided by so many gurus, she somehow in her meditation found a way to give this experience to other people. And that's the way sahaja yoga started in 1970. And now sahaja yoga is practiced in more than a hundred countries. And Shri Mataji received the United Nations Peace Medal in 1989 as a recognition for her work in sahaja yoga. And she has been invited officially by so many countries, by so many cities. And when you go out, maybe if you have time you will just look on the table at the entrance, you will see all the diagonals and some, not all, some of these diagonals and some of these invitations of officials. And now she managed to present her great work of sahaja yoga. And also it's important to know that sahaja yoga maybe is not so famous as some other movements because we don't take money. So we cannot advertise as much as some people do maybe take a lot of money to teach spirituality or to teach yoga or whatever. It's something that people practice sahaja yoga for quite a long time when they feel that really it's helping them and they want to help others. And of course we joined together and we managed to rent this hotel for example to rent this hall with the help of this hotel, like Pramlant Hotel gave us some very special prize because they know that we try to do something for others, not for us, not for me, not for Kundayee, not for any of the sahaja yogis and certainly not for Shri Mataji. So we would like you to really try to see by yourself tonight what's happening inside you. And please we would like to ask you to take a bit of time also. This is not a very easy process but this is a natural process. And the tree doesn't grow into one night. It takes at least a few months before you see something growing out of the earth and then it takes years before it's a very solid and total tree. And especially please remember that you don't have anything to lose in that. So people were just informing me that Shri Mataji had a kind of interview or something like this. So she will come in maybe 10 minutes. But before that what then we can do is that I would like to show you some slides. And on these slides what you will see is that this energy I have been speaking about sometimes can be seen from pictures. So some technical problems. Very normal. Nothing so special. Shri Mataji is here, sitting there. But this picture, we can see all kind of rays of light coming out of Shri Mataji. This was one of the same. This is again, there was no light actually here. It was just a temple in India. And when we took this picture, it was only the light of Shri Mataji. I think Shri Mataji was speaking to people and then she just stopped, put her hands like this and she just started to smile. And we took the picture and this happened. And then she explained that there was some saints living in this temple a long time ago and somehow it was his energy that we could feel, that she could feel at that moment. And that comes as a light here. So of course don't believe that. But you will start to see by yourself. And this picture is interesting. Sorry maybe for those people who are too far, it's not easy to see but here you are, many people just sitting normally. And there are also people practicing Sanjay Yoga. And on top of their head you have this kind of light. On all of them. And this again is the same kind of thing. Just some Sanjay Yoga standing and all these lights coming on top of their head. Shri Mataji is arriving. Thank you. To welcome Shri Mataji, we have an introductory speech of Dr. Sootheen with Deputy with the head of the Parliament and we would like to introduce Shri Mataji. Thank you. Shri Mataji, please come forward. Shri Mataji, please come forward. Shri Mataji, please come forward. Shri Mataji, please come forward. I am very sorry. Shri Mataji, please come forward.

Thank you. Dr.Sue Tin Lclone, I juxtapose Dr. Tao Zhenggiey production. Hitler also represents a powerful and excellent work to the nation. But in his work and experiences, I would just say in few words what Dr. Suttin just said. I think Dr. Suttin explained to us how last year he had the opportunity to welcome Shri Mataji as a VIB in the empire and how he was just overwhelmed by the wonderliness, love of Shri Mataji and how he was just overwhelmed by the wonderliness, love of Shri Mataji. and how he was just overwhelmed by the wonderliness, love of Shri Mataji and her capacity to give joy and peace inside everybody who is approaching her. And Dr. Suttin also related an event that happened this evening, which is that she was even at the meeting with the head of the Thai Parliament, the president of the Thai Parliament. And the meeting was supposed to take only 15 minutes, but actually in the first 10 or 15 minutes Shri Mataji explained about Sahaja Yoga and she gave this experience to Thangul Hoe, the president of the Thai Parliament and his assistant. And then the meeting was for more than one hour because they were so interested and so overwhelmed by this peace and this joy that they started to feel in their heart after the awakening of this energy. And also Dr. Suttin just encouraged all of us to try to discover this very extraordinary way to attain the peace inside that is free and that is for everybody and without any concern for the world, for the age, for the nationality, the religion. And Dr. Suttin also mentioned about Shri Mataji, how she got the United Nations Peace Medal in 1989, how she is a member of the Academy of Science of St. Peter's College, honorary member, and also how she got the doctorate in cognitive science from the University of Bucharest in Romania and how she has been invited by the government of Tunisia to present Sahaja Yoga, how she has been invited by so many countries, so many cities like Vancouver, like Sydney, like Brasilia. Some of these places, they even say that they proclaimed the day of the coming of Shri Mataji in their city, like the official Shri Mataji Day, and also how Shri Mataji was the official speaker for the Ford Women's International Conference in Beijing last year. Thank you very much Dr. Suttin. I come to all the seekers of the Kolkhara Way, I come to all the seekers of the Kolkhara Way, When we talk of truth, we have to know what are we seeking. The truth is, has been and will be. It cannot be displayed, it cannot be transformed or changed. Whatever I am saying to you, you should not take it for granted. We have had lots of trouble with blind feet. But if you experience what I am saying, then it would be better that we accept it as honest people. It is for your benevolence, for the benevolence of your family, for the benevolence of your country and for the benevolence of the world. We have been already told about the subtle system we have within ourselves. In this there is a power in the triangular board known as sacred. That means the Greek knew that it was a sacred bone. This power is joined with three and a half boys. And boys is a student in school and she is a very big power that she is called as Kundalini. When she is corrected, it's a living process of evolution. It is your own power. She is your own individual. She knows everything about you. She knows about your past, she knows about your aspirations. And she is anxious to give you your second birth. All the scriptures have described that you are to be born again. Or you have to know yourself. Even in Koran, no one says, unless and until you know yourself, you cannot know God. So the first truth is that you are not this body, this mind, this ego, these conditionings, these emotions, but you are the pure spirit. The second truth is that there is all-conveying Divine power which does all the human work. You see all these beautiful flowers, beautiful trees, so much living work has been done. Who does this? If you ask a doctor, who runs my heart, so he will say it's autonomous nervous system. But if you say, who is this author, he won't be able to say it, who is that? Also science has its own limitations. Firstly it is a monologue. I mean you can make something nice for living, also you can make a drum home to get it's own. There are many limitations of science, which cannot answer the question, why are we on this earth? He tells the problem is, why we don't have peace and why we are so much tortured in this world. We do not know the absolute. We live in a relative world. Also this mind that we have is a myth. We have a message clinically by our conditionings and by our ego. As we react between these two, the mind is created like a, we can say, bubbles. And the bubbles of thoughts keep us out of reality. Speciality of human beings is they react to everything. And thus this mind is created. All wars, all ugly things, all horrible things, all these are created by human mind. But if you know the absolute truth, there will be no quarrelling, no fighting, no arguments. So what is the absolute truth is this, that you are the pure Spirit? That there is a alternating power of Divine enough that you are a part and parcel of the whole. You belong to one organism or only one personality. Actually no religion is exclusive. For example, Abraham, Moses, they are all described by Christ. Especially Moses described Christ and his mother. Invade this person now. All that will be obtained. She is described in a very honorable way by moments. So how can you sleep Christians and do fight? All the Indians were born in the same place. All the Indians were born on the same tree of the earth. As beautiful flowers. I will not contract them, I will not fight in the dead flowers. But who follows the religion? Only when this Kundalini arrives, She enlightens the religion to bring it. You actually become a religious, in it. I don't have to tell you both, please don't do that. You yourself know what is to be done. At least you yourself become a saint. Once you are enlightened, in the light of the Spirit, you give up whatever is disturbed. Once you are enlightened, in the light of the Spirit, you give up whatever is disturbed. I will not contract them, I will not fight in the dead flowers. I will not contract them, I will not fight in the dead flowers. Many people say out of view of God, how to strike these heavens? In the light of the Spirit, they give up. Overnight, all these bad habits are overnight. At least thirty percent of the Sahaja Yogis are not in the sexual drug addicts. They give drugs, alcoholism, all things bad habits they give up, without any trouble. Because you do not have inner strength, give up. But in the light of the Spirit, you become so confident and you just drop out of all these factors. This is not only that happens to me. If you see your life, you are always embodied by the thoughts of the master of the future. But you cannot be in the present. You cannot be in the present. The thoughts come to you from the past or the future. And you jump on the first of these thoughts all the time. You never can be in the present, it's the reality. Because past is finished, future doesn't exist. So when this Kundalini arises, She elongates these thoughts in the space within you, in your attention. And She will go beyond your mind. At that stage you become a witness, you watch everything. You watch, you enjoy everything. You do not react. If it is something ridiculous, still you know it is ridiculous. But you grow here. The whole thing looks like a ground. Like if you are in the water and not some waves are coming, you are frightened of those waves. But suppose if by some chance you get into a boat, you can watch all these waves and enjoy. But suppose if you go up a street you can jump and make very different coming boat. You cross your mind, as a result you become thoughtlessly aware. You are awake, freely awake, but you are jealous. That is how you become peaceful. That is how you become balanced. That is how you become very compassionate. That is how you become very balanced. I am very old as you know and I travel so much. So they ask Me how to go to the traffic. I tell them I don't think I am travelling. Thinking about its time. I say don't think you are travelling is possible. All these tensions of quantities of stress and strain and all of it just disappears. I don't think you are travelling. Another state that you reach, we can call a good dimension into your awareness is that you become collectively conscious. As I told you, you become part and parcel of the boat. Sitting down here you can feel the vibrations, the divine vibrations of another person and make out for some others. The centers about which you are told are responsible for our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being. So when this Kundalini rises, She integrates those centers. Also She nourishes and permits them to dissolve Her living power. She is the Self. She is the Self. She is the Self. She is the Self. So much is power, your health gets all right, your health problems are solved. ... Through Sahaja Yoga we have cured many internal diseases. ... I did not say we but we should say your own powers. ... We have now a purity center in India where you all can come and get yourself cured if you have tried. ... Then mentally many people have been cured who have mental problems like schizophrenia, obesity, depression, etc. ... Many diseases which are significant are also cured. ... Your emotional problems are solved. ... This is the vast breakthrough of your evolution. ... This All-Pervading power is the ocean of knowledge. ... Knowledge which is true. You can feel it on your finger tips, the knowledge about anyone. ... Also about yourself and also others. ... Because you belong collectively conscious. ... Now if you can cure yourself, you can cure others also. ... You can raise the Kundalini of others also. ... I have not been to all these countries where so the Sahaja Yoga has hurt me, it's more than 100, it saves you. ... Only somebody went to my program somewhere and went back and started searching. ... Like one problem which is enlightened, can't handle you, can't handle you, can't handle you, can't handle you. ... Your attention also becomes very concentrated at it. ... If you could motivate your attention to any particular situation or to any particular person or any program, it gets solved. ... Because this All-Pervading power you might have does everything for you. ... It is the ocean of places. ... But you don't know what they are, how much you are concerned. ... You don't know how glorious you are. ... All this is only possible if this Kundalini can be awakened. ... Above all what happens that you jump into the sea of joy. ... Joy is seen with us, it is not a happiness of unhappiness. ... When our ego is backward, we are happy, when this function is in unhappiness. ... Joy is something that you experience. ... Of course, you see, our brain wants to be. ... ... I've seen people who could never come on the stage, have now become way too leaders, somehow become great musicians, poets, so this happens. ... ... You understand another person so clearly, everything so clearly, that you can have this situation much better.

And then if you say three times, talak talak talak, you can be divorced with so many children of the wife. And they are kept on the street. So, you see, if the children of such families are dead, you have to tell them about the common points. But specifically, doctor, is, they are to be told how the mother is to be saved. How the women are to be saved. Because they are your mothers, they are your sisters, they live with your daughters. So naturally they will start change. If you put these nice ideas into their head in childhood, tomorrow they will reward their parents, reward. Is there enough time left to make all these types of changes? Very much there. You see, now what has happened is, tell him that how, how the street works in Osha. You see, first one container has all the containers. So, it goes up to the point and the first one explodes under acceleration. So the second one then explodes. Then ultimately goes into space. So in our development, we have first physical explosion, then emotional explosion and then mental explosion. Now the last. So you are there. He says, yes, he's ready to run. All the vibrations in him. His organism is telling you what you are saying is the truth. And this is the time. So fast. Now see, Sahaja Yoga is spreading like fire. I came to Russia first in what year? The 89th. From 89 till today. In a foreign country. This is a foreign country in a way, for me. I even don't know language. Also don't know much history, as for ladies. Just pray like that. We all walk under one God Shri Mataji. That's it. And there are no boundaries Shri Mataji. We can't be. The language is not barriers Shri Mataji. How much is the people? Russian people are good. It has got to be very early. Not in the American history. It's a time, place. And these children, so many great children are born in this country. Because it's a better country to be born. Even in My country I must say. But do you know that in India the white skin people have minus room? It's called a demographic crisis. Everywhere. Why? Because children don't want to be born. They'll be born in Russia. They'll be born in India. Umania, Bulgaria, Germany, all those things. They'll be born in Russia. They'll be born in India. Romania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Ukraine. And in the Ukraine Shri Mataji? I don't know. Or Me, I don't know. We can talk about it. We are very special people. We are very special people. We are very special people. We are very special people. We are very special people. What is the point of this question? What is asking about Shri Mataji is about the time. He worries about the time because now there are many rumours and many sayings from different people that the time of apocalypse is here. The time of catastrophe you might say. When everything is supposed to be either ruined or go further Shri Mataji. If the good has to come. And if people don't accept it will destroy all that is negative. It looks crazy. You are perfectly aware of the time, lifting up, they will be left and the others will be destroyed or what Shri Mataji is asking. Actually I don't know what to do because in the hell also there is not much room. They will be hanging the limbo, I think. Don't worry about it. They don't deserve to be in the Kingdom of God. They are dishonest, they have no compassion, no love, violent and even if they are criminals anything can change but if they don't want to change Like Mr. Shirag now. Where are you going to put him? I am a Franciscan president. I have a lot of friends who are not Franciscan. But in politics they don't understand one truth that in politics you don't have to earn money. No, not at all. Because if you earn money, your reputation will go to God. But you have to earn fame. It is Slav, Slav. That's what? Like Abraham Lincoln, This is in the book of Alvaro Shastri who died here. My mother was not the official secretary. She was a realized soul. You see, he was a realized soul. Here we are the Tashkent, then in China. So I forced my husband to be with Me, to write it. You see, my husband has worked so hard, he was ultimately secretary general of this UN agency. Selected by 134 colleges. He has so many awards. But now he says only after writing this book he has got fame. He is little fights after fights of no way. So he is giving the book. Very nice meeting you. Is that the first name? Alexander. So all Alexander's are great. He has his father. He came from there, married an Indian. History he knows. He knows the history. And then when he saw the Indians as they were, he came back and said I can't have it. He is a little worried about the fact, is the raising Kundalini dangerous? They are writing. He has read the books as a senior Israel. He is a little worried about the fact, is the raising Kundalini dangerous? They are writing. He has read the books as a senior Israel. You see why they did it, why they said it. They didn't want people to get the truth. This fellow Gopi Krishna, his private life was so dirty and he just said better to say against the Kundalini so that people don't take the truth and they can earn money. He said that the Kundalini is not a god, that the Lord Jesus is the one. It is your mother, your own mother. The Kundalini is your second mother. Anxious to give you your second birth. She knows everything about you. She knows everything about you. Like a deep recording. How can she harm you? When you were born, your mother took all the labour pains upon herself. How can she harm you? They don't know anything. He read this from some Indian authors, books by Indian authors. They are all, we can call them, kurinas. And very bad in character. Actually. This is the Muladhara. This side is different, you see. Which is at the base. Indian also. Now this is responsible for all our exclusion, inclusivity. This Kundalini crosses only six centres. And this centre is kept not in the process. Now here is Kundalini. The second one. She can teach you about the second one. Now, when you see what happens, this is the path of Kundalini. Now, when they try to raise the Kundalini from the sexual parts, then this daily Shri Ganesha of His innocence, innocence, then He gets a mouth. And He passes heat all over Me. So, one should know that in the awakening of Kundalini, you should not disturb this. So, actually, when Kundalini rises, all your exclusion stops, every time. Sometimes we are programmed for nine, nine hours. And I don't go to bathroom and you people, none of you. Because, you see, this stops all activity. Because it is innocence. Christ has said you have to be like children to enter into the kingdom. Meaning innocent. They use sex. That's why. The wrong way. Incidentally your Mother. And Her chastity. He looks out of the chastity of His Mother. You see, it is very interesting what they have done here is, the way they have done. But ultimately, you see, this becomes this. So, because, now I said that Christ, because Ganesha never incarnated. He was the internal child, He was the internal child. So, now Shri Ganesha incarnates as Christ, innocence. Now, everything is tangible. I told them that this chakra is made of carbon. You say carbon. It has four. Now, this carbon atom I asked them that you take it. We have lots of scientists. Now, if you see this atom from the right side, you see a swastika. Now, if you see. Now, you see from left to right, this is Omkara. This I told them. Now, if you see from down below. Alfano. Christ said I am the Alfano. The proof is there. We got a scientist here. Who I told them all these centers have a big hierarchy. So, you tell them what happened, how. Put it on Ganesha now. It's not so bad. Well, this is take after, ... ... and we put it in the paper container from the bag... in the morning. And then he put it on the container like this one. You will notice that... ...we call it An premediation, but theMedia principle is no longer possible in colourful respects. As you know he used springs like this. This I told you 10, 15 years ago. Now they have found out. This is the book for the children I read. Very sweet. They are all here. So I want to give you... Your smile is very similar to a child's smile Shri Mataji. Yes, I see. Now what I am saying that I want to give you this book and you can see through by the way just the essences. It is very similar to the book that I read. Thank you very much. Yes. This is the school. This is the school. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very, very much. The Himalayas are not simple things. No, no, no. They are not. This is the school. This is the school. Yes, I am very happy with the tourism. This is a very simple system. This is just about every hill area in the Soviet Union. He was on the Palmers. He went to the Palmers in the Soviet side which is quite near the Himalayas. Still in the Soviet Union. But on the Himalayas as yet he hasn't come yet to the Himalayas. He has come and also to tell in the time by time for all of you in the other side. They are the great pieces. Yogi has done all the job. He was very, very glad to meet you Shri Mataji. Thank you very much. He feels he has got very much from our talk, from your talk Shri Mataji. I need to send you some more books to read. Because he understands English. Yes, he understands English. Yes, he understands English. Because he understands English. A little bit Shri Mataji, he said. Quite a lot. Thank you. Thank you, ma'am. Where is his card? He gave the card. Yes, yes. He gave the card. Please. All right. So should we ask her to give it to Shri Mataji? Very nice meeting you, very nice. Very happy and I wish you all the best for the development of Shri Mataji. Russian children I have met. And also Russia, of course. Thank you. Thank you. He is a patriot. Thank you very much. Thank you. Very fine questions.

have brought for the Indian Sahaja Yogis. And it's very sweet of them to have brought all these beautiful things for you, whatever was possible from all different countries, and whatever was available they have been able to bring it and luckily everything has reached safe. So I think we should thank them, so give them a hand. I mean if the foreigners want to be here, they are welcome because they are the ones who have brought all these gifts and they should see the joy of the people who are here, but if they want to rest they can go and rest also, it's all right. And now I will tell you one after another. The first year we'll have children, very small children, up to say three years or four years at the most, very small children if you have any, or anybody who has small children can come, without the child also will do. So, I think it's very important that we have children, very small children, up to say three years or four years at the most, very small children can come, without the child also will do. So, I think it's very important that we have children, very small children, up to say three years or four years at the most, very small children can come, without the child also will do. All right, thank you everybody. Thank you. All right.

Thank you very much. Thank you very much. And thousands and thousands of our Sahaja Yogis are waiting for you to come work. And not only the Sahaja Yogis, but all other people who are all waiting for you to come here. And please, please say us something. Not only for us Sahaja Yogis, but maybe for Russian people. When the heart is filled with so many emotions, I love Russia very much and I love Russians. Not only Sahaja Yogis, but everyone of them. Now it is the duty of Sahaja Yogis to give the joy of eternal life to other Russians also. If they all decide individually, there are so many, they can do a lot for your own countrymen. One person, Me, has done for you, so imagine what you can do individually. But there should be determination, because we have to bring peace and joy, not only in Russia but in the whole world. All those people who have gone to other country from here, they have proved to be very good Sahaja Yogis. Very deep, mature Sahaja Yogis, I don't know what has done that to you. Everyone asks Me how did Russians are so good. I can't explain. Something of previous lives, I should say. I have no explanation for such genuine, honest understanding of Sahaja Yogis. We don't want any more wars. We have to change human beings, we have to transform them, so they know how to live together with each other. Some Russian girls were married in India and had very good wives. All over the world they want Russian wives. They want you to come here but you need to tell them, because they said in Ganpati for him all of them come, then you can marry. You are all welcome. Very well. I don't know Russian people how they are so introspective and so deep. Otherwise human beings are not easy people, difficult to tell them that there is eternal life waiting for them. Especially in modern times people don't believe that there should be something else waiting for us to enter into the Kingdom of God. Thank God you had no religion, nothing, so that you are not conditioned, you are a clean slate. And now your own inner innate religion, nirman, religion, that is American religion. When I had come here first time I saw so many men and so many women specially, smoking and smoking, and they were all in the same place. They were all in the same place. They all have become such a mystery, so happy and so joyous. When I had come here first time I saw so many men and so many women specially, smoking, drinking, but see all of you don't do that now anymore. They all have become such mystery, so happy and so joyous. This is the light of the spark which I have. It is the light of compassion. This compassion which is so intelligent, this power, I'm sure one day you will go round the world to teach them what is peace. By giving them peace and not only talking about it. Just by talking about peace, peace cannot come. Nice to see your face is so peaceful, so beautiful and so joyous. I'm a very proud mother of Russians I must say. Thank you very much. I must say your singing was beautiful. I may not understand the language but it touched My heart. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy.

How tall do you think? Like me, my thumbs are there. So tall, in your butt. We've got my hands. You are very beautiful, very beautiful. Much better. I was afraid and it was very hot. Then I just thought why not change the weather. And immediately change. By the time we reached Romania it was very very rainy. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Let's go, let's go. Let's go, let's go. Let's go, let's go, let's go.

Lund lux fre HC So we are looking for you. How are you? Thank you. Yes, they want us to talk to each other so that they can have some photos. Yes, for both of us. Will you please have your... Yes, please. Come on. Good evening, sir. He is from Italy. Hello. Hi. Hi. Sir. Hi. Hello. Hello. Aocal. Hello. Hello. It is nice to meet you. Are you jamming? Yes. Nice to meet you too. Thank you. Not that one. It is written that he lives under the intensity of healthy food. Something, you know, the other, the other. Is that your first visit to Egypt? No, it's my first. But I came long time back before. I was in Italy, 1960. I remember. But came from now. I can't make it out. I know this has very much changed. Very much? Changed. I think in a better sense, because there has been ten years ago problems in circulation for Mr. But it's far better, it has gone good. And we are doing our utmost to accelerate development. Yeah. Good. I mean, it's an interesting place because of the ancient history. And I saw the plane by which we came was all full. From where you came? You came from Rome. From Rome, yeah. We have a very strong group in the tourism industry. From the supply point, from the, I mean, the capacity of infrastructure, the quality of high-risk goods and also from the arrivals. So it's trying to get it. It's good. But also from India you have no India? You have no India? Of course. Yes, and they are increasing. Yes, they are increasing. We have interesting statistics about their arrivals and the feeling of nights and... India is growing now. Yes. It's a late nation. That's one of the things you must recommend in your history. That's right. I hope everything is taken care of. Yes, very fine. Mr. Ati Hosni is a big total operator. Have you received My letter? Yes, that's very kind of you. Yeah. Thank you very much. Thank you. So, you were all saying that, you were all saying that I have been in the room because I didn't come for My work before. It's the first time I have come for My work. Understood from Mr. Hosni that you are interested to promote tourism, like... Freedom and also peace. Because tourism is a strong mean of, for dialogue, human exchange and peace. Peace, it's a... Shri Mataji is bringing forward a very important message, you can say, which has to do with peace, excellency and... Atisha can die, let's suppose. What happens? Father, you see, you have to have peace, can only become when human beings will become concerned. So, there has to be peace. What is the meaning of this? Is it true? I don't know, I don't know. I don't know. But you are not a person who... No, I am not a person who is a person who is not a person. Okay. There was some confusion. About the cars. About the cars, I see. Now, I feel there is more peace. I will feel it. See now, they have gone to jigs, they had some... Of course, I don't know why, but it's very dangerous. No, I don't think of the miners. But there was such bad trouble that they had to get out. Can you talk about that? Yes, about Turkey. Yes, yes. If the... If the... If the phone record... If the state of Egypt specified the path of... If the sea crimes all over the world, all kinds of crimes, there is an important indication about the peaceful nature of this population. Egyptians lived in Saudi Arabia, in this country, and they were a mystic part of it. We have a multitude of races, a multitude of countries, a multitude of populations, I think, who came and just lived in this country. So we learned tolerance, we learned tolerance, we learned to live together, and that's why there is a great openness of script. They consider that the other is part of yourself, because this is interaction, all the time interaction. You can find people... ...African, like myself, others like French or Europeans, all Egyptians, I mean, it's a... No matter... Like India? Yes, and here the religion for instance. It's a very interesting and very important. Nobody knows, sufficiently at least, that... ...ten million, eight and ten million are Christians of Egyptians. So they are taking things like that, generalizing, making... There was very big propaganda last year. Yes, traditions, the idea of Islam and fundamentalist, Islamic countries, but what about our population? Is that a factor you can drop when you are talking about the tolerance? They are living for more than 14 centuries, citizens as Muslims, without any discrimination, they are in the government, they are in the top of the army, security services, everywhere, in the parliament and so on. This is something very special for Egyptians. There is no problem of minorities, for instance. There is no... There is no problem, minority problem, because what is minority? It is a cultural minority. That's it. What is the minority? Minority is a cultural minority and then in Egypt we cannot say that, because Christians are praying in Arabic. They are contributing in the enrichment of the national culture as others. A minority can be a geographical, you know, the idea of gatos or programs or others, but Christians are living in the same building with Muslims. There is no cities where you have Christians and others for Muslims, in the same building, as we see. A minority can also be an economic, social one, rich or poor. They are as rich, as poor as others. Everywhere, spreading the social strata and that makes no minority into a minority. Eugenious people. I think what Shivatad is doing is something very special, because she brings an experience which is really integrating all the people, all the races, all the religions, everything, by giving an actualization, an experience from inside. Something that you can feel in your inner system, something which transforms. religion is within, it's not without. If it was without, then anybody who says, I am a Christian or says I am a Muslim, would not do and commit any sins, but they do. That means they are not. So they have to become, is the point of experience of becoming. Also in Koran it is very clear to the prophet Muhammad, that unless and until you know yourself, you will not know God. But the attention is not on that. It's attention, whether it is Christians or Islam or any of the religion, is on something very superficial. It has to be attention what is being told, what you have to be. Even Christ has said, you have to be born again, you have to become yourself. Muhammad Sahab has said that, the prophet Muhammad has said that you have to become the worry. Now all these things are not like that. What is happening, just money orientation or power orientation and fighting with each other. Christians fighting Christians who still fight in ourselves and Hindus fighting Hindus. What's happening in Afghanistan is a terrible example. Terrible, I mean I just can't understand this one thing. I was trying to understand who is supporting whom. Nobody is supporting nobody, everybody is killing everybody. It's fine, so many people are dying. But everywhere you see like that, you feel that people must know the truth. Unless and until you know the Absolute Truth, you go on like this mad, solid madness. See, when you cannot recognize another person as yourself, there is madness. And that can only happen when you know yourself. And that's the work I'm doing all over the world. And as a result of that I found that all over the world there are thousands and thousands of people. I can't tell you the number, but in sixty-five nations or sixty-seven, I don't know sixty-seven, sixty-seven to be correct, you know, it's progressing so fast. You know, it's working out. Especially in a place like Russia, I mean, we are missed, where they have also Muslims, they have all kinds of people. We have houses, perhaps they were so oppressed by communism, perhaps maybe, or they are very deep people, I don't know how they do it. They don't want anybody false, they are going. Because from India lots of false people went, then as a reaction the Americans became also false and all started making money and all that. But this, if it happens, the problems you discover. Because I think you should see My book that is here, I work through it. It's a more sort of My witnessing the West, it's more on the West than the book. It's like just lectures on different subjects but here I'll discuss the point. It's very interesting, very interesting. And also the gene, problem of genes and all that. Oh yes? Yeah, yeah, because I've done medicine also. Also? Yeah. So I've dealt with this gene problem and the problems of human beings as such and what do we have within us which helps us to get this, this way. There's a system within us and is described in the Koran as Asas. It's described already there. See, though Koran was not written by Prophet Muhammad, he didn't write it. For forty years, thirty to forty years it was long time ago. Then after a long time it was written. Osmani. Osmani, yeah. And who edited but some people were very cruel also at that time, very cruel people. And they came one after another, these khalifa. They were not Imams, you know. You have to be the Imam to write and they were not Imams so they missed lots of points but still lots of points involved. Now this is the one which is, is the power in our triangle bone which rises through centers, six centers, presses through here and you get the cool breeze coming out of your head and also you feel the cool breeze on your fingers which is the root. This is the experience one has to have to become a Ruhani. A Ruhani which means spiritual. This is an Arabic word as well. Of course we also use Ruhani. To become Ruhani you have to have this experience of feeling the Ruhani. Otherwise it is like an artificial thing you see some pictures say for example you see it's raining in the picture. It's not really raining actually. It's artificial. You have to go in the rain to feel the rain. In the same way this is you have to feel the reality and this works out now somehow I worked it in such a way that it works out en masse. Thousands of people get it spontaneously. It's very surprising. Yesterday that journalist Excuse me. Yesterday that journalist who was talking to Me at the airport just felt it. Just felt it. He's an intelligent man. He just felt it and I came back and told him that he's got the realization. I said, you test him now. He's a fancy also. He's a fan. Same thing he is. He's also a sinner. We felt it as a process. Ruhani. Already. Like this. You can feel it on there. You can also try. Try. We're trying. Just put your hand like this. Why don't you sit on your chair with the chair near Me? We can do that. This will bring us. We can try also. No, no. Just put your hand like this. And this inside. Put your hand like this. You will see what you will get in this book. Just see on his head. He is great. You must work. You will see it. This is what is the root. This is the root. Now you must know how to use this root. Root is the power of Divine Love. I'm compassion. He's saying that. He's got it too. He's feeling good. He's Ruhani. She can say it. What? What? Ask him. There is waves? See, there's a place for Ruhani work. See how so fast it got. Now feel it on your foot. You are such hard working people. And you get it so fast. Means you are seekers of truth. You are seekers of truth. Seekers of truth. Now you felt it on the head also. No, on the head I felt it. I don't feel it. I don't feel it. I feel it too much. I think too much, yes. Isn't it? He's got it. Left, right. That cold very often. This finger means that there is some obstacle, we can say. An external system. Just put your hand in your arm. This level. Is that cold often? Yes, but I take bronchial wax. It's better. No, you don't have to take anything. I think I can. Better now? See? Are you relaxed? I am better relaxed. We always like that. Keep putting your hand here. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. So what's your name? I'm a human being. I'm a human being. I'm a human being. I'm not a human being. Oh, I am. I'm very much relaxed. Let me see. Nice to meet you. Just the flesh. Now now see. Now you can do this to others. No? I am qualified to do it to others now. I have the power. You gave me the power or it was there? It was there. I have the best intentions to be a Ruhani. But people I'm dealing with are not Ruhani at all. They will pick up. You can make them. They are materialistic and sharks. You can make them. You can solve your problems. I will solve their problems, I hope. Because, see, we don't know but there is this power all over. There is something about it. And now you have entered into the Kingdom of God. And this power will help you for all your good work and good things you want to do. Yes, I'm ready to have this adjustment. Yes, and you should just master it. Just master it. That's all. What about you? Yes, I'm ready. No, you can just take out the book. He is not Ruhani. He is not from our team. No, no, no. Put another hand also. Like this? Are you feeling anything? If he is help, you know, say, throw. Of course. What does he do? He is a director general of My technical bureau office. A director general of the ministry. Of the tourism department? Of the cabinet of the ministry. You have to put your hands like this. Like this? What is interesting? Land being. Yes. Now, this here. No? The first one is for this. The first one. The first one. Let's see, let's see. It's coming. Yes, yes, it's there. It's there. You have to love yourself with the main point. Right. You have to love yourself and respect yourself. Very active. All of you, because you see the whole thing very little. At our conference, we will have a conference with the yoga master. Yoga? Not yoga, no. This is spiritual yoga. It's spiritual yoga. You can feel the Divine. Divine, yes. Yoga Divine, yes. Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja Yoga, Sahaja Yoga. He's bought. He's getting it here. Really? Oh, that's great. I'm active again. All right, sit down. Yes, it's there. It's there. Yes. It's there. It's there. I'll tell you what to do. Oh, nice. When you sit down, you can relax. It doesn't mean that you can sit there. But when you sit down, you can relax. All the energy is there. They are all in the very happy mood. That's the main point. Yes, we are happy people. We like others. We like interaction. It's exciting for us. Now, she's very good. She's very good now. I like it. You are very good now. You have to forgive, sir. Just forgive. Very important. No, it's not a sin. It's not a sin. It's not a sin. Because whether we forgive or don't forgive, we don't do anything. But if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands. You eat yourself. You eat yourself. That's the point. Now, just sit down. Yes. All right, it's cool. Can you feel it in the end? Please. There you go now. You are a yogi now. You are a yogi. You are a yogi and a johani. Yes, you are yogis and johani. Johani is a person who has a real experience, who knows all about reality. He cannot be just a person certifying himself, but he has to ask. And one has to grow up like a tree. Those spiritual thoughts and the spirit and ideas is fantastic. We cannot live by silly, stupid material things. We have to have this belief. We have to have these gods and the other belief. Values, human values, truth, courage, humanity, tolerance. That is not mental. Otherwise life is ridiculous. What you are saying is correct. Very correct. But if it is just mental, what's the use? It has to be your power. Oh, yes. That will be better. Better to have your power. Because that's the way it works out. You may say many things, that's all you face. But it should be your power. Just where you stand, you emit peace. You emit love. That's the power. Radiate. Radiate. That's it. I am seventy-three years of age. Are you? So you are like My son. No, let's say you are a brother. All right, what's your name, sir? My name is M.A.M. M.A.M. Yes, M.A.M. M.A.M. That's my... M.A.M. D.O.U.H. D.D. Like David. D.D. Like David. D.D. D.D. Like David. D.O.U.H. M.D.O. What is that thing? Somebody who people praise him. Who is praised? M.D.O.H. The one who is praised. Alhamdulillah. Alhamdulillah. Alhamdulillah. Alhamdulillah. Alhamdulillah. He says, not yet being published because he's still full of mistakes by Indian printers. But whatever it is, it's all right. Okay. Goodness. All right. So, may I ask you one more question? You are what? What is that? What's he saying? I was thinking must I should come here on stage? On stage, you could have it. Yes, please, if you say it, I can do it. For some time. You develop this energy. Somebody will. If you say it, I will do it. It's very important, isn't it? Okay. You have to have this. Let's see what happens. You will get a very nice paper form. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

Satsang with Mooji Satsang with Mooji Satsang with Mooji Satsang with Mooji I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the very outset we have to know that truth is what it is. We cannot know the truth at human level. To give you a very good example, I would say that if you see a beautiful painting with rain and beautiful flowers and trees, but you don't get the rain. You just see outside. But if you have to have the experience of the rain you have to go inside the picture. That also if you do is to enter in the picture, you will break the picture. So actually we have to now understand that whatever we know about truth is just a picture. Unless and until you have the experience of your being, of your self-knowledge, experience, all the words, all the descriptions are useless. Another good story I'll tell you about one gentleman, his name was Shapish and he was a big cheat. And he went to the king and he said that, If you give me money I'll make a very beautiful palace for you. You must also give me, allot me the land. After one year he said, Still I'm making. Second year he said, Still I'm making. Three years passed. After six years the king said, I'm going to come and see the palace. So when he went there the king saw nothing but the land, vacant land, no, there was no palace, nothing. So the sharpest started telling him, see now this is the big gate into which we enter in and this is a very big palace here and there are beautiful, very beautiful, big, big places to receive the audience. So the king was watching and smiling. He said, Yes it's very good. Ultimately he said, now this is the main hall and in the center there is this seat, a special seat for the king to be seated. It's a throne made with beautiful lions and you sit on this throne. So the king said, All right, it's a very good idea. I'm very much pleased by your work. So will you please sit on the throne? I give you as a present, you sit on the throne. So Shabish went and sat on the throne in a sitting posture. So the king asked, How do you feel? He said, Very comfortable. So the king said, All right, go on sitting. He sat like that for half an hour and he got so tired then he fell at the feet of the king and he said, Please forgive. In the same way, in the seeking of truth we are going round and round and round of some people talking about it. There are many in India I have seen, also so many come from abroad who are standing on their legs, standing on their heads. Some are reading books, some are reciting mantras, all kinds of things they are doing because they think they are seeking the truth. They are truthful, they are faithful, nothing wrong with them. But it's a punishment of Shabish on them. Some people starve, some people renounce the world and do all kinds of things. Thinking that they will achieve their self, that they will know the absolute truth. So people go to different places and worship and do all kinds of sacrifices. They change their dresses, cut their hair, it's not going to help. Actually something has to happen to you by which you experience the truth. Because people are easily enamored by all nonsensical things. And so many are lost in this punishment. So what is the truth? However I am going to tell you, you should not also believe blindly. This blind faith has not helped us at all. People are fighting in the name of God everywhere. Because blindly they believe that they are Christians, Hindus, Muslims, all kinds of people. All kinds of wars are there and so much is talked about peace but nobody has peace. So whatever I am telling you now, you shouldn't believe it blindfolded. But if you experience it, then you must believe in it as honest people. You must believe in yourself. Because it is benevolent for you, for your samadhis, your country and for the whole world. So the first thing is that you are not these thoughts. Unless and until, unless and until you know yourself, you cannot give up your seeking of truth. Christ has said very clearly that you are to be born again. Now if you put just a certificate born again, how can you become born again? It's all a false certificate. But if you are born again, then so many things happen to you and you get the experience. Experience of the all pervading power of Divine love. You see here beautiful flowers, here beautiful flowers and we take it for granted. We never even doubt how such beautiful different flowers are being created. Now if you ask the doctor who runs your heart, they will say it's the autonomous nervous system. Now if you ask them who is this auto, they don't know. It's just a name they have given. So once you have decided to be yourself, you must get the experience of this great power of Divine love which has created the flowers which has made you into human beings. Even Mohammed Sahib has said in a Koran that you can feel the all pervading power on your fingertips when you get resurrected. And the fifth Imam, Imam means realized soul, he has said very clearly that you will know absolute truth on your palms. When the resurrection will take place, when you will become a super human being or you will become the self. So you have to experience this all pervading power. Power on your fingertips. This Divine love we have never used before. In the name of God we have used hatred, jealousies, all kind of secretive destructive things. So the first thing is we have to feel, experience this all pervading power in reality. We have been already told about this power which is in the triangular bone. This is called as sacrum, this triangular bone. Means a sacred bone. So what is so sacred that the Greeks knew and they called it sacrum? Now this power is within all of you, all the human beings exist this power. And when it opens and sprouts like a primule of the seed it goes up through the different centers and comes out of the fontanel bone area. It's not just somebody puts water on your head and say that now you have become a realized one, it's not so. William Blake has said that a priest cursed on my fontanel. He cursed me on my fontanel. So this is the real baptism, real again I say real. It's like this instrument if it is not connected to the means it has no meaning. If we are not connected to the means we have no meaning. And then we have identity problems. I went to America and I was surprised the young people some are wearing armaments here, some wearing hair, some are wearing half pants with one side machine, hair cut all kinds of things. And they told me, this is their identity problem. You are wise people, try to understand by changing your outside are you going to change your inside. All right, let us see what happens when this Kundalini rises. Now there are seven centers you have seen. All these centers are responsible for our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being. For example when this Kundalini rises the first thing she does is to cure you. Cure your physical elements. It cures your mental problems. All these modern problems of stress and strain is finished because there is a hole here. All the time this vital power of love and compassion is flowing within you and your emotional problems are also solved. Now the spiritual problem is that you have to become the Spirit. As soon as you become one with the Divine your Spirit's enlightenment comes. Now your attention becomes enlightened. Your eyes which are all the time full of lust, greed, envy, hatred become innocent. They become innocent and very powerful. There is a glint in our eye which is like a light and such a light when it falls on anyone can transform another person also. Secondly you must know that your so called mind is a myth. Myth is that it is made by us through our ego and our conditionings. As we have made computer we have also made our mind and then this mind controls us. We go according to the mind and the mind can lead you anywhere because it is controlling us. This mind we have to cross over. We have to go beyond this mind. How it happens? From the mind come all the thoughts of the past and the future. One thought rises falls off another thought rises falls off. We are jumping on the cusp of these thoughts. We cannot live in the future or in the past. But reality is in the present. We cannot be in the present. So what happens is that when this Kundalini rises she elongates those thoughts. And the space is created in between. That space is the present. Where we do not get any bombardment of thoughts. If you want we can think but we can be absolutely away from it. So our personality develops another dimension called as thoughtless awareness. We are aware but thoughtless. This is the first stage which one achieves called as thoughtless awareness also described by Jung. The attention which becomes enlightened. You can feel anyone sitting down here with your attention just like ether. You can feel it on your fingertips. You can feel their centers. Then you talk the language of centers. You don't talk person who is white, black, grey, anything. You don't talk what dress they wear. But you talk in the language of centers. This is something that has never happened before. So another dimension comes to us known as collective consciousness. You become collective. As they say a drop becomes the ocean. But you become it's not just talk. You can feel chakras of others on your fingertips. If you can cure your centers you can cure the centers of others. So you know the truth. You know the absolute truth. Now see some people don't believe that Christ was the Son of God. After realization you ask the question. And then you find tremendous cool breeze growing in your hand. Cool vibrations. You lead a very relaxed life and very joyous satisfying life. Now Sahaja Yoga is working in 65 countries. In a very big way. For example in Russia we have Sahaja Yogis might be equal to population of Portugal. Because they have suffered so much that their attention has gone inward. And they have taken to reality so fast. I'm sorry that after so many years I have again come to Portugal. In America also I went after nine years. Because when I went there I found they are not at all prepared to take to reality. So I gave it up. But after nine years very different. Very different they have grown up. They had to go through the circle of materialism. Then they realized that there is something beyond because they are not happy people. Now when you become reality in yourself that you have no thoughts you become a very peaceful person. Completely integrated. And one with yourself. Today we talk of world peace, global peace. How can it be with the people who are full of all kinds of funny situations? They are identified with this or that and they are fighting. Even among themselves they are fighting. Even in the family they are fighting. So the first thing is important that we have to become absolutely peaceful within. Put your mouth to this otherwise they can't hear us. So it is important that our transformation should make us absolutely a peaceful satisfied person. That is the state we call as Sahaja. Saha means born with and Jain is born with you. Born with you the right to become one with the Divine power. For that you don't have to do anything. You cannot pay for it because it is the living work of evolutionary process. How much did we pay to become human beings? How much do we pay to the Mother Earth for giving us the flowers? She doesn't understand money. And the Divine doesn't understand money. You can pay for the hall, you can pay for the mic but not for your transformation. This is to be understood that anybody who asks money for your transformation or spirituality is a bold person. So as you know the absolute truth and your attention is also enlightened. The greatest thing that happens to you that you jump in the ocean of joy. Joy is not like happiness or unhappiness. If your ego is pampered you feel happy, if it is hurt you feel unhappy. But joy is singular and that is to be experienced. In one lecture I am sorry I can't tell you all about it. But telling is also words, words, words. Unless and until you have the experience what is the use of talking? So I think best is to have the experience of the Divine. It will hardly take ten minutes. But before that I will tell you one thing that it cannot be forced on anyone. You have to ask for it. You want it. Those who do not want to have or are just sitting here as aggressive people I would request them to go out. Because I cannot help them and they cannot help Me. They cannot help anyone. So those who don't want to have I would really humbly request that they should go out. First and foremost think you should know that you are human beings at the epitome of emilution. That means now only the last breakthrough is to be achieved. So you must have respect for yourself. For example you should not have any guilt in your mind at this moment. I can't understand people tell you that you are sinners and that you must go on repenting. If you are guilty you would have been in jail not here. But it's a matter of fashion also with people to feel guilty I think in the West. The Portuguese who went to India they should have learnt that Indians never feel guilty. They don't know what is guilt is. If you have done anything wrong all right correct it. But don't go on harping on it that I am guilty, I am guilty and curse yourself for nothing at all. So the first condition is that you are not guilty and you should not feel guilty at all. If you feel guilty then you catch the center on the left this one. Which is a very very important very important center because when it is in your body you get many diseases. One thing you might get spondylitis, you might get angina, you can get cervical cancer. You can get all the organs very lethargic. So why feel guilty all the time? In the West it's really some sort of a funny norms like one fellow told Me that I spill some coffee on somebody I am feeling guilty. Is she a stupidity? You must respect, you must respect yourself and love yourself. Because I am talking of compassion and love. So forgive yourself. When you forgive yourself also forgive all the others. Because whether you forgive or don't forgive you don't do anything. Logically you just torture yourself that's all. And play into wrong hands. If somebody has done wrong to you just forgive him. Leave him to Divine. And everything will be all right. Because this is also another problem is that this center here is like this in the brain. Is the crossing of the optic chiasma where the center is? Now, if you don't forgive others then this will never open out. It has to open. For that only thing you have to say in your heart that you forgive everyone and forget about them. Because even to remember them is a headache. So why carry this headache? Now you have tortured yourself quite a lot. But at this important moment please forgive and get your Self-realization. That is very important. Thirdly I would have to ask you to take out your shoes if possible. All right, thank you. Please be seated. Now you should be all seated comfortably. I have told you you don't have to go to a Himalaya or stand on your heads. In short you should be comfortable. You should be very pleasantly placed towards yourself. In a way is good there is heat and so on because you can feel the cool breeze and let down. Those who are sitting on the chair can put the feet like this. Only on the chair. Away, away from you. Just away. Now please put both the hands like this. That means you have to feel it on your central nervous system on your fingertips. Now please put down your head and put your right hand towards Me. And bend your head and see for yourself with the left hand if there is a cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. It can be hot also. Move your hand up and down. It can be nearer your head or away. It can be hot, can be cold. Now please put your right hand on your head. It can be nearer your head or away. It can be hot, can be cold. If it is hot that means you have not forgiven yourself or others. So now please do it. Now take your left hand towards Me like this again and bend your head. That's important. Now see with your right hand if there is a hot or a cool breeze coming out of your head. Now don't doubt it's coming out of your fontanel bone area. Now please put your again attention on yourself and forgive yourself and forgive others. Now please put your right hand again once more past that. Bend your head and see. Some people get it closer to the head, some away, so see for yourself. Bend your heads, bend your head. Now raise both your hands upward like this and your head also upward like that. Please don't feel guilty. Now here you have to ask one question out of the three, three times. First question you can ask three times. You can call Me Mother or you can call Me Shri Mataji. Mother is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? Now the second one or second one. Mother is this the all pervading power of Divine love? Ask this also three times. The last one if you want to ask, if you have not asked any one of the former ones then ask the third question three times. Mother is this the Paramachaitanya the root? Now put down your hands. Put both your hands towards Me like this and don't think you can do it. And don't think you can do it. Just don't think. All those who have felt cool or hot breeze on their finger tips or on the palm or out of the fontanel bone area, please raise both your hands. I bow to you all now. Now you have become saints, remember. But the seed that is sprouted has to grow and for that we have a very good center here. You have to develop this in Portugal. It is very important to understand that the problems which are there, which may come later have to be solved. Also for this growth you don't have to be. But it should not be when I come you are here and when I go away disappear. First time I came there were two hundred people asking and he translated it but then they all disappeared. So you must value yourself. You must know what you are. Don't waste yourself. Because you are very great. You don't know how great you are. Once you grow up you'll develop a new awareness called as doubtless awareness. Which means you have no doubts and you assume yourself. Get your assumption. I wish you great luck and I hope you all will grow into big trees. I'll be here next year. It has to grow. I've not been to South Africa but there are at least ten thousand sahaja yogis. May be more. So I have to request you to respect yourself and respect your Self-realization. Don't doubt yourself. Of course you have to grow up. Because Kundalini goes to different places, cures you, cures your problems and then it becomes a steady thing. Like when you are in the water you are afraid of the waves. But once you get into the boat you can watch, you become the witness of the whole world. But if you learn how to swim you can jump and save many. Thank you very much. May God bless you. May God bless you. We have one more song where I think you all should clap because that will help a lot to improve these vibrations. It's amazing how these are westerners are singing Sanskrit, Marathi, Hindi songs so clearly that nobody can make them out. May God bless you. May God bless you. May God bless you. So many people have become great artists, great musicians. So there are lots of potentials but first you must grow. May God bless you. May God bless you. This is a poetry written in the 16th century by a very great poet. And he says in Marathi language, Mother is called I, as you call it My, I also we call in Maharashtra. Now this, he is asking the Mother that you give me the yoga, the union with the dukkha. And what I have done, other things he is saying that how I have gave up this, gave up that. But you don't have to give up anything, just have this. This is a poetry written in the 16th century by a great poet, Shamas Maya. And this is a poem written in the 16th century. But you don't have to give up anything. You have to give up. Now they talk about the Kundalini's rising. Jagadamad is the Kundalini and he talks like this and he says it goes up. Jagadamba means the Mother of the universe. That is the Kundalini which is the reflection in you. And she gives you the rebirth. Jagadamad is the Kundalini and she gives you the rebirth. Jagadamad is the Kundalini and she gives you the rebirth. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, oh! Nogamalina sonora, Nogamalina sonora, Hola mia, mia, mia, mia, oh! We are the people of the world. We are the people of the world. We are the people of the world. We are the people of the world. We are the people of the world. We are the people of the world. We are the people of the world. We are the people of the world. We are the people of the world. We are the people of the world. We are the people of the world. We are the people of the world. We are the people of the world.

Two names are like Raneer, who loves Rama, who gives. And the curry means, who is the one who does. So this language itself is a very symbolic language and the way the meaning is also extremely symbolic. But what I like about them that they know very good classical music and also the drum was very good. Apart from that you see they are singing from the heart. It's not just to please Me or to please you. When you sing from the heart it's different. And if you see their eyes are just shining, they are all realized. Now I have to tell them later on about Nomad Sahib, about Salimda, and Ali, his two sons. All the history about them is they don't know. Then they will know what they are singing as such a being. So they are all our own, they are all our relations and we all have to accept them as one of us. May God bless you.

It is the rhythm and the emotion that the songs written in Spain have. The country has a lot of emotions. And within us the emotions move, they move within us. For everyone, whenever I went, people just say my Spanish or something. So I just wondered what it was so similar to me and the Spanish women. I think that loving my heart is just all my things, but I think the women of Spain become loving. I think that's it. It was all of it. It is my own love that is expressed in each and every gesture. I hope that to all Spanish women this same love is expressed towards others. One thing we have to realize is that the yoga is love and divine love. And it is not attachment, it is not possession, but it is a divine love. It is not love of the flesh. It is not love of any material thing. Love is the love of your faith, but it is the love of the divine. The liberation takes place if you really try to witness everything in its real form. And see for yourself that how and why are you attached to something. Once it is discovered that we are attached in our witness state, then automatically the pure love starts going. As soon as you get your light, the sunlight, all the fog disappears. In the same way, as soon as you get spirit shining in your attention, all your doubts, all your mistakes disappear. This is what I told you today, that you have to be aware of yourself. Because now you are fed to yourself, your spirit. So when you are just feeling you are like a brilliant diamond, which is feeling like right self. So it is important to understand what you are, what others are not. And this awareness should be a firm, innate part of your being. Then only it will act and permeate into the atmosphere and into other vision. I hope when you go back to your countries you will give my message to them that we all have to be aware of ourselves. If you put dirt on the diamond, it won't shine. But dirt has nothing to do with the shining of the diamond. If you remove that dirt, it will shine brilliantly. For that you know what is to be done, is to witness yourself. If you are still right sided or left sided, see for yourself. And find out what's wrong. Just clear it out. Just do not accept it. Do not accept it. Because this dirt and faith is covering your diamond. This is what we have to understand in Sahaja Yoga. Then once you shine with that brilliance, nobody has to say with a vow that it is a penalty. You are. Nobody can doubt that brilliance. I don't want to have to do this. Nobody wants a person who is fake, who is impure, who is unrighteous to talk about God. Everyone wants reality. Only thing is that they should see reality in you or you should manifest your reality outside. The first one is not in our hands to make them understand reality. The second one to manifest reality is in our hands. Now for example you have seen very well I travel and arrange a program, there are thousands of people. In Italy they just saw my photograph and they came to my house. I do not proclaim anything, I do not promise anything but they all came. The reason is they are sensitive and they can see that there is genuineness in this face. Whatever is inside is expressed outside. If one is not genuine it shows outside. That is why the inner light should be made a big, big, brilliant light. So that we can make people see reality. In Rome when people were seeing this, one old man came and said that I can see the light of their faces. And you can see there is a picture that there is light for everybody's head. The other day I saw one painting that I remember from New York. And Greco has done a painting, very short Christ disciples being blessed by the Holy Ghost and all of them had light coming out of their heads. There were so many few, but you are so many and all of you have got light on your head. It is guiding you, it is looking after you, it is loving you, it is showing you the path. You should never feel that you are alone, but try to keep yourself clean because this light will disappear. May God bless you. I am sorry I have to go to Varvani. You learn that. And I will be traveling many countries, three months, I am already booked. But you carry this message to all the places and let me see what effect it has on that when I will be settling. Now I have to go back to England and I have been traveling for many months. I would like this message to go to all the countries in Europe and the world. And when I visit all of them I would like to see the fruit of this message. Last of all let us give a hand to Jose Antonio who works so hard to bring Sahaja Yoga to Spain. Thank you. Thank you all of you, all the people who are staying and all the people who have come from outside Spain for bringing Sahaja Yoga to Spain. Thank you all. Thank you. Who are going to Varvani? This is your hand, to Varvani by plane. And then we have four different ones for every day of the day because everyone will use different things. Thank you. It is not important. Thank you.

So Dr. Spyro is saying that first we showed the ridiculous and then the sublime. We have to give a hand to English Sahaja Yogis for bringing such joy to all of us. The tent was raised of course by the Italians but the stage was done by the English. This particular theme was prepared by Shivaji. He did it, of course a little bit I added to it but not much. So it's time for us to depart. May God bless you, all of you. I am sure you all have enjoyed very much and you have grown and that your sasradas are completely open. It's very big day for me specially that such a great thing could be achieved in such a short time so easily that I didn't understand the importance but now I know how important it was to open the Sahastrara and give realization to people. That time I didn't realize it was so important to have an en masse realization, really I didn't understand. Also I was not feeling very confident about human beings that they'll accept anything. But it has worked. Started with one lady and today you can say there are so many people, so many of you are here who know the truth, who know what is Divine love. May God bless you, all my love, compassion and all my blessings be with you. May God bless you, all my love, compassion and all my blessings be with you.

He never felt the time the way he played it, I really... He never felt the time at all. I was thinking he was going to play more, but it's over now.

66305_Comment_Part_2_DP-Opt_HD

He is so talented. I mean, I didn't know what to say, but he is really remarkable at this young age, he should play so well. Like Mozart, I felt his comeback or what in Sahaja Yoga.

66305_Comment2_DP-Opt_HD

This is a very beautiful raga called Shankara. It's played before Shri Shiva, you see, it's like that. And it is, I think, it has one beautiful thing about it, the way it is played. You feel sometimes the nataraja is not dancing before. The way the rhythms are, the notes are placed like this. It's a very apt name for this raga, for Shankaras, very apt.

66305_Comment3_DP-Opt_HD

I must say, He went into ecstasy and also you all were in a very different realm of Divine blessings, I think, the way you were enjoying the whole thing. But as He said it, this raga is difficult to play so fast because the notes are very far away from each other, very few notes, and you have to move your hand very fast. It's really remarkable every time I hear something new from Him and every time I find such creativity, working it out. I don't know how far this gentleman is going to go in this great art. As it is, you have noticed that today he was in a very free mood and full of heart, played so well. It was something very unique for all of us to hear such beautiful music on such a day where we are celebrating this Sahastrara. It's something that has to do with vibrations, of course, but I think that if a person plays with full attention and full dedication, after Self-realization, he got his realization all right, then it acts on your Sahastrara also. I could see you are all going blank completely and just floating into the beauty of this raga and enjoying all the waves, different, different styles and different, different permutations, combinations. It's very creative, very beautiful and I hope we'll have him again and again and enjoy his music very much. Only thing I was worried about his finger a little bit because sometimes the finger starts bleeding also when you play such a raga like Durga or another raga is very difficult. It has also got few, few notes. When you play Durga, I always tell them play short, not very big because I'm a little worried about your fingers. So this, in this you have to use your fingers. You can't use anything else. Once I suggested somebody that, why don't you put some plastic? He said, no Mother, we can't put any plastic. How can we put a plastic and pull the strings and things? I said, but it's rather cruel sometimes. We are all enjoying your music and you are bleeding. That's not good. So he says, but I never feel bleeding that time. So it's a very difficult raga and requires tremendous practice for any raga whatsoever I should say. But these ragas, these are with say five, five notes are very difficult and I was surprised that once we had some Japanese friends who knew one or two ragas on this like Munakali and all that they knew and they were so amazed to hear Shankara that it was prayed so beautifully. They just, I mean we can call them, they just want ting, ting, ting, that's all. They don't know anything compared to Indian music, the permutations, combinations and all. It's a great blessing. I think in our country that we have such great artists who are doing such great work and are serving the art itself. They are specially blessed by Goddess Saraswati, I think that the way they are working it out is impossible to understand a human being doing these things spontaneously so beautifully. It's absolutely a divine art, otherwise not possible. Somebody told Me that the Muslims are not allowed to play anything, they are not supposed to have anything to do with music. I said, nonsense, it's not possible. How can Mohammed Sahib of all the things would say such a thing? Because he knew that music is divine and music has to be enjoyed otherwise you don't go into the ecstasy of your joy and that's what I could not believe such a story when people told Me. But in India you'll be surprised that the music is mostly played and is also sung by Muslims. So this shows that this is nonsense, it's not possible, how can they do so well? So this is how sometimes you see people try to bar the music and try to destroy the beauty of such a creativity, of such a blessings of God. Now I hope also that some of you will sometimes go to India and learn this music and also can entertain us. Of course Nishad Khan has many advantages over you. Firstly his father is a very well known sitar player, his uncle I have heard him, he is a very great sitar player. And I mean their family is known for this and with what deafness they play and understanding their plays, from very childhood they are hearing all this music in their families and the whole thing is worked out as a like a tapasya. And he has so many advantages over you but you have one advantage at least that being realized souls you don't have to learn any classical music but you appreciate. This is something great that has happened to you, that you appreciate and all these artists have told Me that we have never seen such nice audience which you have Mother. We forget ourselves here. Yeah, that's what they said, they just forget themselves and they feel so one with all of you and they can't understand that you have never studied this music, you have never heard this music and how you are submerged into it so easily. Some people have been in Sahaja Yogi for six months, eight months and they understand the music so well. It is to be understood through your heart, not through discussions and arguments and things like that but through your heart you have to understand. And once you understand through your heart then you see it is the essence of joy of that creation just pours down into the essence. You don't have to learn, you don't have to go to school, college, university. On the contrary I have seen people who have been to universities for music are headaches I tell you, all the time they go on finding faults here, finding faults with the musicians, this, that. Such a headache it is to be in their company. But just to have pure music understanding is so simple I think with Self Realization and that's how you all are enjoying it so much. I was myself never so sure about it and I always felt that I am, I hope I am not forcing this music on people. But from the very first day we started this music in Sahaja Yoga people were absolutely floored, I couldn't understand how they have accepted it. Of course there were some people who were little back numbers but they also came up now and now without understanding the notes or anything just they get plunged into it and they really enjoy above. You should not think that it is any hypocrisy or anything but they really enjoy Indian music. It's something really marvelous to feel that this is the music of the Spirit and that's why now they don't listen to any other music. They don't enjoy any other music but classical Indian music. It's something such a great advantage. I mean if you have to train so many people in the university. It is impossible. It is impossible situation and we have thousands and thousands, even Russians will be surprised, Russians. All these people have taken to this music so sweetly. It's something really miraculous and I thank you very much for rendering all these raga so beautifully today. Yeah, Mataji, this is the fifth time I think I have played the Dharwari Kannada for you and every time it has been different. I am very grateful you have invited Me this time. Oh, they are very enamored. Today also they are in a very different mood of this Sahastrara day when since this Sahastrara was broken for that. It's a very big event in the spirituality, spiritual life of people. So for them it's a very sort of a enjoyable day. Also today is Mother's Day. So all these combinations put together I think they are just listening to something celestial. They say, pele gandhar bhaagara nahin ho dete hain. Like that they are feeling about you. Aapne ku bhu dunya deekha hai hai. Paapi to ushme char chand raga hai. Aapne pachh mein taktile sindhi bhar bhi bhajana chaat na. Nein bhajai daroor ye to sunne ki dar bhi bhai te kar kar bhi nahi hua. Aapka samaste. Ye kare thay bhi to ek bhi nee bhaj hai bhi bhatare ekti musse. Dho bhaje takto kamse kam program mona hai che aap. Aap to mujha aadati ho gayi kit doe bhaiye sothi mein usa. Pal sohi nahi saath. Suna hai yeh, kala vati suna hai yeh. You have never heard this raga kala vati, have you? No, you have. You are all. Aap yeh saare bazaar mein jakar ke, aa yeh sab kar ita rata hai. Aapne Hindustani bhai mein hai, duslam music kar ita hai. Aapne se kath hai tumlo kye kya kar ita kar lek, katumlo ke kya kar ita bhekar ki che. Duniya bhar ke cheeze ino nahi katti kari bhi. Bhaja hai tohle kala vati. Kala vati is a beautiful raga, you'll like it. Kabhi bhaiye nahi nahi kisamne ki sine bhi isle, man sotha kar thola, kala vati thola sa suna hai. Thank you.

One thing we don't have is a person who knows tabla very well. If anybody wants to learn, they should tell him and ask all about it. It's in Manchester actually. In Manchester? Now we don't have any Sahaja Yogi in Manchester, do we have? Few are there, but are they good at tabla? Landalar atte to bhi? Na pa yoh shakto hai, that's no problem. He can come to London he says to teach. Alright, we can call him in Shweti camp, Saturday, Sunday. Paro bhaan. Arrange it. All those who want to learn tabla in England should give their names to Dr. Spyro.

You have been noticing it this year with the people coming to the local programs, they are older. The kind of a, I think a feeling of frustration. I'm trying to understand what's the meaning of that. I'm not going to give it at you. Just I want you to hear. It's not a nice song it was. Bhajan? The universe things. I think it's a very good song. Hey, come, just put it there. There's one more tape in my room, I'll tell you what it is. There's another one on the other side. It may be in the... How many films you have? A lot. What you send them? They go to England. England? Or the Austria. Austria. Have they reproduced it? Some of them Mother. How about Taiwan? I think Helen was doing it, you know, Efrem's wife was doing a channel. She works in the TV station and she was copying them. Your father has done such a remarkable thing. With such dedication. So nice. One so beautiful that I told them also to change the color of the paintings that you have actually written. It's another one I think. Another one in the... Something they have given Me. Biharis, I guess I can give it. It's another one in the... I don't know if it is works, people are listening to it. Done by the Bihari people. They are attaching Me to them, I think. It's just My building. That's My spectrum. This is the villagers, they have done it. Let's see what it is like. This is not a painting. Villagers from Bihari. This is one. They have no tape recorder. They are just bringing one. Very happy. What is this photograph? Sir, can I see this? A bell? Sir, can I see this? I can see it. What is this? Boredita. So nice. I can see Rajicha's hotel. Thank you. Hotel vibrations. So we just have wishes. A. A. A. You saw this one? Mother Mary's. All of you have seen Mother Mary's? Let me have one. You just see this one. Who brought this one? It's on the stage. Mother, may we at some time know the science that lies behind these photographs? May we at some time know the science that lies behind the phenomenon that appears in these photographs? You see, this is done by Shiva. He's doing all these tricks. Just trying to convince you. But actually it is, I must tell you that it's a fact also. And this is the one She brought you, that She has brought you. It's a fact. And some of the photographs, they catch it. It's what I said that a new mood has started. Can I have? I can't get it. Is there any one? They have to get it one. Which one is that? That behind the... We're just waiting for the cassette player. This one of the villagers. Let Me catch. You see, everybody is trying to sling and to go for it. Another one I'll give it to you, may be mistake. Sort of their heart is not limited. Their heart is very much there. I was talking to her as to what trees you can have in that ashram. And She said it's a dry, hot cabin. Yes, and it can get reasonably cold also. Frosty, yes. And frosty. So I would say in the beginning you will have to look after this with some covering. Once they grow up, then there's no problem. And you must also apply for some input. I told her many trees you can input. Many types of things. And if you vibrate them, then they survive. If you vibrate. I told her various names. You try. Wawa you might get. Really? Jikku, gawa. You like all that. Wawa you like very much. And bananas, may be. I don't know. What trial? What you do, first you get one tree each. Plant it. See for yourself. It works. If it works, then you can do it. If it works, then you can get it. If it just gets destroyed, then you don't have it. So try for one year any one of these trees. Then you can get grown. For Teek, She said you have to have a humid atmosphere. How do you have rose-foot here? Do you have rose-foot? Not actually. There is a thing called a queen stone rose-wood, which has a beautiful smell like roses, which we've been trying to get hold of. But it is a eucalyptus. It's not a rose-wood. It's not a proper, it's called a rose-wood, and it smells like it, but it's not. It's actually a eucalyptus. One that. Eucalyptus is all right. But, see, a part of eucalyptus. Try to be positive. Try. Try. Try everything. With vibrations anything is positive. With vibrations really anything is positive. It's not difficult. We've got it. For a year if you try, you will know exactly. Now, I thought, I would just say this. We'll let one little bit I would like to see. I don't know what sort of thing it is. The hardest thing is actually to get the trees. The hardest thing will be to get the trees. No, but they are importing them. You see, here now, they will trouble us so much for food. They are importing everything from here. It's only question of money. If you say we are importers, you'll get it. You have to pay some money. That's all. Otherwise, all kinds of things are coming from India here. All kinds of food, everything is coming. How is it they are getting Indian food here? I asked them, they gave, showed me something. They said, Mother, it's all imported. Yes. Well, most of the things that are here are imported. Then how do they know? They don't make much. They are My family. They must have some new clothes. They are not You can have papaya. You can use only seeds. How are you feeling? You feeling all right? You, I'm sick. Yes, I'm sick. All right. Just a little bit tired. Tired? Why? Because of the hot 24 hours. I will sleep at all. In the daytime, you should take a little nap, as good as. Like in Italy, they always have a siesta, and that's how Italy and Spain. Nothing is open. All right. All right. All right. We don't have much in here, in this house, because it's only we don't have much in this house, because it's only since Saturday that we moved in. We don't have much in the house, and that's why it's taking a little time. It was really. Today. But this one I've done that. Yes, ma'am. Everything is there. That's the one. This is rasam, from India, I think. Put this on the thigh. And the chairs, everything? No, the chairs are from, the Sahaja Yogis bought the chairs, the furniture. Furniture? We bought, yes. You bought it? Oh, no, it comes from different people's places. And they gave you, I will wear the carpet. The carpet and curtains, yes. Is it yours? Yes, ma'am. And those are? These two here, the house? These are from the house, yes. I tell you, it's a couple of houses. It's a couple of houses. It is the summertime about eight months here or so. Yes. Mainly, mainly summertime. A little winter. Winter is very short. Like Delhi. It was very cold though. It was quite a shock after Maharashtra. Yes, but it's only for people. I mean, short one, yes. It's very hot there. It's very hot. Oh, Pune is better. It's not so hot, not so cold. You've seen the house? Rajasthan. Really? How? It's only in photographs, yes. You've seen it? Well, I've seen it. This time? This time you saw? Last time? Last time. Not this time. Next time. This time, see here, indoor, everyday, lunch and tea. I've got beddha, this time. Did a good job. This is from Greece, isn't it? I don't know. From Greece. I'm not sure if that's it. That's not India. No. I'm not familiar. I think there's also one from Italy. You grow them? No, in Italy. No, you don't know. Any of these? No, you breathe. Italy, they don't grow. Italy, they are very nice, you know, some limited things. Like the jadi, stad. All the time, they eat that. All the time. All the time. Very traditional. So many courses. Just can't cope with it. Just can't cope. It's still the people are great. It's still the national. Even I, even all the police will come. Say Namaste. I'm so surprised. Would you like some fruit? What? Would you like some fruit? Why don't you come over here? Why don't you do the rubini? In the room. Come. This is the village one. This is the village one. This is village one. We bow to the Mother. There's a song song for our India. This is the Motherland. Here's the destiny for me. This is the Motherland. Look at her. She's around. The Bihari look. You're not from Bihar. I'm one man, Mr. Shemah. Got to transfer to Bihar. And now he has got 200 Sahaja Yogis. Spreading like fire. Before the persons, there was one who met Me. She is from Malabar and there are 100 Sahaja Yogis. I came to Malabar and we've been there. Only the fellow who got transferred there. Have you now got same thing? These are all government service. They get to transfer. They start Sahaja Yogis. Just like they were going from place to place. When he was in Italy, he said, I have better for Italy. I said, but not a single Sahaja Yogi has come. You come along. I said, all right. I went to Austria and see the love everywhere. The steel is pressed like one candle. Wait, I'll take your time. I'll take your time. Is this the first time you have come? Is this the last time? First time. First time you have come. First time I have come. Really? You must have given one to Me. I was a little tough, I was a little tough, I was a little tough, But I was a little tough, I was a little tough. Bhakta Bhagavan is doing such a good work. He is doing great. He got rid of his eyes. He is doing great. I was feeling like a medicine. He had it for so long. He had his eggplant for so long. All over the eggs. I am full. He is very good at eating. He is very good at eating. He is very good at eating. He is very good at eating. He does have better on the other side of the kitchen. And that means that is the bathroom. Yes, that has all glass that looks down the back of the garden. Very nice. Very light. Very light. Yes, all the bedrooms are on that side. There is a little room in there which I'm going to study. I think it's a little study. It just does a very small building. Yes. Is that a 50? Yes, I think we played 40 in the early 50s. But I think it's been redone. Sometimes it is. Some of the door frames have been changed. This one. This is a local wall called Jarrah. But it's been stained. It is... Is that radioactive? Yes, it is lighter and it can be darker. Depending on the age of the Jarrah. But it gets a lot wiser with this. This one is a bit dull because it's been... But really Jarrah is very rich. Very rich. She was having something... It has double... Yeah. Fabulous winging. Yeah, she was having something. This way and that way. From here. Good. They actually made a ply like that in different ways. Across the fibres. They even use this one. Mainly fine. They do use Jarrah. The same part of that one. In the South West a lot of this paper has been used to make paper. Yeah. Yeah. They chop it up in little pieces like this and send it to Japan. It's such a nice wood that I like. Exposable. Very hard wood. Actually at Burwood, the floor, the college floor is Jarrah. All the way. But there's no Jarrah in Sydney. It's Western Australian thing. The dominant of Western Australia. I'm not sure what to say. I think that she has a teak. Yeah, but it's been slain too. Teak from where? I'm not sure from where. The chinta. Taiwan. Taiwan teak is. Is it teak? They say that Taiwan teak is popular? Yeah. They found Taiwan so maybe they know teak. I thought that. It is a Russian. Malaysia. You said Malaysia? I don't know what kind of. Malaysia. This place to play stands is a... A lot of chukwud is there. Yes. All kind of... I think there must be teak. It's full of... It's very tropical this one. What? It's very tropical. It's dense. It's tropical. It's gone. It's very hot. Yes. Another... The... The half of this have disappeared. That's all right. She said that she has a peach. So, when you went inside to see them, you were asking where are these half of it? I'm seeing... After some time I saw... You were venting those... Cool things. Yes. You are going to die. This is the place. This is the place where... The people who are here are going to die. Tell them about this. Tell them about this. All right. Got it? No problem. See now. Now, that money I have is less. Do people sing here or not? What? Do you sing here music or not? I'm so Indian. Can I come here? I'm not sure. I'll come here. Come here. I'll come here. I'll come here. I'll come here. So, all of us turn. I'll come here. I'm the only person who plays the tabla and sings also. Once you have realized them, then you cannot practice. It's nice to see all of you singing the same songs. I have passed the Pashtana. I'll come here. I'll come here. I'll come here. I'll come here. Tomorrow evening. He said we'll present you with some nice... You are also singing. That Martin for Gans is very good, I must say. Yes. It's taken to Indian music very well. He says, now I don't like any Western. I just like Indian music. And he's teaching his children also. He sings very well. He's called very nice voice. Super. Everyone noticed it. I'll sing very well. But he has met somebody else there, you know. It's Sahaja Yoga we have problems with problems. I don't know what to do with them. Who are better than the other? That's good laugh. Some are very innocent also. Like one gentleman in Delhi. Got a habit to talk to him. In Delhi. Got a habit of giving a speech all the time. They said, Mother, he keeps such a long speech and we don't even have time for Aarti. Never be listen to your lecture. He is the one who will give you. I had not... I mean I had the... I never got this complaint. Before that only I had said in one of the lectures that you should not give lectures. My lectures are there. Let them listen to My lecture. Then do Aarti. Finish it. And then this news came in about this gentleman. So he telephoned to Me. He said, Mother, I heard what you said it. But now what am I to do? Whenever I go to the ashram and whenever I see people I feel like speaking. Just I can't control myself. I said, Now what to do? I thought, I thought, what can I do? I said, All right. You put one beetle nut in your mouth. He saw me and I said, He said, How big I should put it? A little bit of thing. That's how life is. I mean sahaja yoga is quite some... I mean you can just jump into your ego very easily. I'm a sahaja yogi. It's not... It's quite a common thing to begin with. Then they follow. Then again they climb up. This time we were in Vampati Puri. No. Jose prepared a drama. He told me about that. The first person who was attacked was Mr. Yogi Marjal. And he was reading all over the place. He said, But why me of all the places? I said, Because you're very shy, that's why. Jose has ideas and I care. When we were in Milan they had a... This divine. And they would crawl for the first time he came out, out of London, in that program. And what do I find Mr. Jose copying Mr. David Brough? First time this fellow has come and he's copying him. Now he never copies. That's quite worrying. And I was quite upset about it. So I told him, Jose, you should not have done that. He's come for the first time, he's copying him and what will he think of you? And he'll never come again to sahaja yoga. He said, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. So then David called him to say, and said, I apologize, I say, I'm sorry, you know, he should not have copied you because he was looking like this at him. He said, No, madam, what a talent! Look at him. I did all this two years back, but he remembered each and everything. What a talent! I was so relieved by his appreciation. All kinds of things happened in Sahaja Yoga. But I don't know why, but in Australia, in Russia, they dreamt about Me much before that. Some man, some scientist dreamt about Me ten years back. And he was dreaming it every day. Ten years back. Country , what has result free ... .... He wrote a book Some fellow told me, saw Me dreams Like living from MY blighed view Tonight. Yes. Yes. But that's all right. But this fellow dreamt about ten years back? Yes. This one. Ustam also dreamt. Ustam was a dreamt. But in Russia there are so many. So many who dreamt. That's how they came to My program. They never heard about Me, nothing. Postering, I think. Okay. All these TM people looking lanky-panky, all sick. They went out and said, very good, let them go away. You see, it is, it really harms people so much. Sata ami gevaya khatoma. So I'll have my dinner, if you don't mind. Tomorrow morning he says ten o'clock with the pugya. If you are ready, I am ready at ten. Where are we? It's very far away. It's about an hour, it's dry from here. So I should be ready by nine? You will take the... Tomorrow morning. Depends on, you see. When you are ready, then you have to telephone. Yes, Mother. So even if I leave at ten, it could be eleven o'clock. This is no time. So we'll have Mahavira's pugya. We have never done Mahavira's pugya before. Allow Me to answer that. Okay. Good night.

Now coming back to the basics in Sahaja Yoga, we have to know that in Sahaja Yoga we have no hard and fast rules for anything because you are American people, you are saints and you know what is good for you. But you must keep that quality of saintliness and certain things you should avoid yourself if possible and if not then see that what's wrong with your centers. If something wrong with your centers you start getting into problems, getting into ideas, something which are destructive. Now coming back to the basics in Sahaja Yoga, we have to know that in Sahaja Yoga we have no hard and fast rules for anything because you are American people, you are saints and you know what is good for you. But you must keep that quality of saintliness and certain things you should avoid yourself if possible and if not then see that what's wrong with your centers. If something wrong with your centers you start getting into problems, getting into ideas, something which are destructive. So is best is to judge yourself first of all how are your vibrations. Now the best part that has happened so far I think in Perth which as I was happy that they have assured Me that they will try to get a big ashram because yesterday you saw how many people there were, day before you saw how many there were. Now if you have to help somebody in such a big way then we have to have a big ashram, a big place where people can come. I found out a suggestion another one if you can accept it that first of all you can have a big ashram somewhere which is to be renovated and all of you try to renovate it, it's not difficult as he said that you can purchase some dilapidated things as we have in Sahaja Yoga, mostly people come dilapidated, isn't it? And we put them right with a camera. In the same way we have to rebuild the whole thing, renovate the whole thing, a big thing and he says that he can get a loan for that for renovation which you can pay as rent and can be looked after and also the people who are coming from outside you can tell them that it's not for Sahaja Yoga but for this hall that we have here, a bigger place that little bit money could be paid and they wouldn't mind paying you some money but not for Sahaja Yoga, it's just for that gradually you should introduce this idea to them, will be a very good thing. Now collectivity should grow and collectivity grows with certain other subtler ideas that we should have about collectivity. First of all we are all saints, aren't we? So now we cannot talk ill of each other at all, we cannot. If we are thinking ill of somebody or criticizing somebody then we must know there's something wrong with us. In Sahaja Yoga we should not criticize anyone, we should see the beauty, the glory of another person and praise the joy that you have, the happiness that you have because if you want to gather the thorns you'll get thorns, you can't get flowers but if you want to gather flowers you'll get flowers. So nobody should talk ill of any other Sahaja Yoga because that is one thing creates a big problem in Sahaja Yoga. And secondly there's a leader within. Now there's a leader if you find something wrong with him then you directly tell me don't discuss among yourselves and create a group against him or her because through him only or her I can talk to you or come to you. Now supposing there's something wrong you can telephone to Me, you can call to Me if you think something dangerous, something is going to, it's all right, doesn't matter. I can talk to that person, I will ask the whole thing and we can manage. There's nothing wrong in it. I mean after all you are a part and parcel of the whole but every moment if you go on standing fighting with the person or trying to find something wrong with the person or trying to do something that will harm the basic unity then it's very wrong and that is one of the responsibilities you have that whatever you think there's something to be done, your suggestions you can give it to the leader. And if you think there's something very wrong in the leadership or in certain decisions he has taken or she has taken then you are open to write to Me absolutely. You can telephone to Me. All these letters pass through proper ways and it's every letter is sort of found out to be whatever is needed to be given to Me they give Me. Otherwise also they mark it that Mother this is the point that letter has. And the letters which do not require any sort of answering we don't answer but the answer comes somehow. So supposing you have a problem, the problem can be solved and all that. So there is no need to write various things like sometimes I'm from Australia, I letter comes it could be from ten to twenty pages. First of all it costs so much money to you. Secondly the people in England become suspicious not the Sahaja Yogis but the post people they think what's coming here some sort of politics or what. So there's no need to write very long letters just few things of how you are, how you are engaged. How everything is and sometimes you know these from America on the Thanksgiving day they wrote such sweet, sweet things only one sentence but such beautiful things that really I couldn't get over for ages. I said, Oh God I have done so much as the way they have described very deep and subtle things. So the subtler you become less you talk, the less you tell things, the less you talk. The less you write. As you know that in Zen system they write very small sentences, very, very small sentences and in that small sentence they say such deep and subtle things. So there is a report on a subtler level not on a superficial level. Thirdly I would say there's also a tendency among so many people like Harsh was with Me or somebody is with Me closer but he's not the leader, see. So they tell him Harsh go and tell Mother like this, please tell Mother and he got fed up really. He said I am not the channel, leader is the channel why don't you tell the leader. Whatever you want you tell the leader and leader can tell Mother. Not Me, nothing to you. Then he got really mad because everybody started telling him tell this to Mother, tell this to Mother. He would not tell Me anything. He said I am not telling her anything what's the use of telling Me. So you should not find out any other channel. Your leader is there and we can decide. Now the point he has brought out now that about marriages normally, normally and there's no hard and fast rule as I said that it's better to marry a person who is married and that is better to marry a person not from the same place or not from the same collectivity. Now the reason why in India supposing now there's a village from a village they don't marry in the same village or from long time back it was not in the same university they would not marry. Even today the one who belongs to a particular university is called as a Gotra. Say My Gotra is Shandilya so I cannot marry in the Shandilya Gotra. I can marry, you know this was thousands of years back you see our forefathers must have studied in that particular university the Shandilya University but even till today I cannot marry somebody belonging to the same Shandilya University. I mean it's so far fetched but the reason was that that in the colleges or university a relationship should be there of complete celibacy and purity, that purity gets boiled. Supposing you want to marry somebody in the same area is all right you can marry but it should not be a common rule because then the purity cannot be maintained you will be looking out for a girl in the same area where you belong and there what happens some eyes will lose their innocence, Miladhara might be caught up. So it should be that you should marry outside so at least the purity of this place is kept. We are all brothers and sisters but if there's somebody who really thinks that it's important to marry and they want to marry somebody there's no hard and fast rule so it's all right but normally it should not be, it should not be a normal thing because then you start seeking out girls and all the time looking at girls you decide whom should I marry, whom should I choose. In the beginning we had these things, lot of these things in India, this problem and it was such a problem and mostly such marriages have turned out to be very funny to us, very, very funny. We had a very big mess up in Austria. There was a girl who wanted to marry someone, I said all right, I said yes, I cannot force anything like that, marry, since we both are sahaja yogis and then that girl fell in love with another sahaja yogi and with another and she became pregnant with another man when this sahaja yogi had gone out but it's such a problem I didn't know what to do with it. I just don't know but then this sahaja yogi, the first one her husband refused to have. The another sahaja yogi would not say that that is his child and a big problem came through because this girl lost her sense, you see, she went from one boy to another because if you go on like that there's no ending and it was a big problem, still it exists there but now she's left high and dry, I mean, there's no one who's with her. So first of all we should not pay so much attention to it, it's not important in sahaja yoga. The most important thing is you try to keep yourself pure, your vibrations all right, no problems and also if you, any sahaja yogi wants to have relationship outside sahaja yoga one has to be very careful because we don't know what sort of a mooladhara they have, what kind of problems they have, you might jump into something very serious and then you come back with a very serious problem telling Me, Mother, we had such problems as he knows very well even in Australia that somebody went with somebody else and she developed her peace and now it's difficult to marry her, something like that. So you see, in sahaja yoga we have to understand that marriage is all respected, it has to be, but it has to be monogamous. You cannot have uh.. mono andrus and monogamous. We don't believe in marrying one man, living with another man, running after third man because you see what I've been saying is coming true now, people have AIDS, people have all kinds of diseases, now in America also they think that monogamy is the best and after all it is not natural because supposing a man is married to a lady then the lady wants that the man should be in her privacy, should be hers and the also the man wants the same. If it is not so they feel jealous, they are not never happy. That's one of the symptoms that if a person is not happy uh.. with this kind of a thing then what's use of doing such a thing. Marriage must make everyone happy, that's first sign. If a marriage doesn't make everyone happy, such a marriage is a curse on society and these marriages don't stick also because you must have the support of the collective. If you have the support of the collective and if it generates joy and happiness, children are better, society is better and the whole situation is so good. You enjoy I mean uh.. such marriages but when you find something goes wrong you all become very serious, you don't like it. As in now you know in England we have problems with the royal family and there was a rumour that this princess Diana is going to divorce and everybody was so unhappy about it because they used to think such as they were Romy and Juliet and all these ideas were in their heads and suddenly you hear of such a ugly stuff and people were very nervous you see and they became very uh.. unhappy about the whole thing. So the marriage is to, is the best way to give happiness to others by having sweet children, having a good family, having a sensible life, gives such a, such a joy to all the collectivity. So that's why it is important in Sahaja Yoga that you should have marriages which will be successful, which will be sensible, which will be balanced and which will create beautiful children. Because I told you so many children are anxious to get born to Sahaja Yogis because they have great souls and they want good sensible parents. So we must understand the essence of everything. Why in Sahaja Yoga we prefer this but of course there's no hard and fast rule if you want to experiment with something you can experiment but when you suffer Sahaja Yoga can't help you. So whatever is needed, whatever is good has to be tooled and guided and we should live with that idea. Now another thing that affects collectivity I think and the idea of having a separate house is very common with Indians specially so beware of them. Indians will find out ten excuses to have a house of their own. Uh.. this is the worst part of Indians you see they cannot have a collective life. Now we built a nice ashram for them in Delhi spending so much money. I tell you I also gave them lot of money and there's not even a rat living there. I said what is this? Uh.. nobody lives there. He said Mother you can live. I said I am the only one who has to live in so many ashrams. What's this of wasting money on ashrams then what is this? There's no need to build any ashrams if you are not going to live together. If, if few people cannot live together how can this world going to live? And only when you are all of you together My attention is there. Now we have some very good ashrams, very good ashrams and they have done wonders, wonders where the leader is kind, compassionate, loving and also corrective. If you love somebody the person doesn't mind you being corrected, doesn't mind. Now I, I also tell you many things you don't mind because you know I love you very much and this love is the thing that really is the correcting point. So if the, if the leader is loving, affectionate, compassionate then if he tells that this is not good for you, this is not for your benevolence nobody minds it because it's good for you. It's just for you, for something that will be good for you, good for your society, good for the country, for the whole world and so we have to realize that we are here for a tremendous task. Such a work nobody has done so far, no saints have done this. Poor things they were born one here and one there and one there, either they were killed, they were given poisons, were thrown away or tortured so far. But you are not one, you are so many all over the world, you have friends everywhere and you have so many relations everywhere, such sweet things. The another thing is people come to Ganapati Puri, many of you, then you should not form an Australian group. This was once we discovered that Australia is great, Australia is this thing and it fell down. God created one world, really. But then human beings called them Australia, India, England like that, that's their own being. You see it's all their headings, not ours. We are all one. So when they come to Ganapati Puri you must know that you should get mingled with other people, you should know them, you should write to them and you should have lot of fun and make fun of yourself and fun of them and it's very enjoyable because after Sahaja Yoga only you start seeing what's wrong with Australia, say what's wrong with India, what's wrong with England because you are so detached and you start seeing that this was the mistake and you really enjoy it and they, I enjoy when they really pull each other's legs nicely and enjoy each other's company and are so sporting and so sweetly enjoying each other's company. That's the greatest enjoyment for Me and when I see people are in a very jovial mood, in a very understanding mood, they are together of all the nations. Now we are in forty nations, can you believe it? And if we can just forget that we belong to any particular country, we belong to the country of God's Kingdom. Everything works out all right and we have to be beautiful people otherwise the others see and say, oh that's such a man was there and such a person was there, he did that and we have no business, no need to be arrogant at all with anyone, there's no need. We have to be extremely loving because love some people think is a weakness, is not, is not, it's the strongest thing. Now you can see from Me, in a way I am a foreigner in your country, I came to you and all that and the love has worked. So love is the strongest thing and we have never used the power of love which of course you know how to give bandhanas and things and to work it out, your love. So have faith in yourself that you are loving, you are compassionate, that's why you are dynamic because love is dynamic and all these things will help you. Now living together you can do something collectively also, I have been giving some ideas that you can work out this way, that way, so many things can be done and we can really establish a kind of a proper society of Sahaja Yogis. As you know that Vishwanir Mahatharma has been accepted as a federal religion in America, as a federal religion in America, so we have to establish here also. Now when you have entered into that then all these conditionings and all this ego and all this just drops out and you become pure beautiful people, which you can, I mean it's your own property, it's within you, so why not get to it? Why to ruin yourself for anything else but to ascend and in ascending you never can be in trouble, never can be in trouble. Now we have to help so many people, there are people suffering from alcoholism, suffering from drugs, suffering from other things, mental problems, physical problems, all kinds of things you can do a lot. One person can save so many people, so now all of you should decide also how many people you are going to meet and how many people you are going to give realization to and how many people you are going to attend to. Now when these new people come in then also one has to be careful, not to immediately say you are a bhoot, you are this, you are that. They don't understand your language, you see, you must know your language is different of chakras. So the best thing is to talk to them softly, gradually tell them what is Sahaja Yoga because it's absolutely a new science. They think it's a new philosophy, it's not new, it's an ancient one but they think like that so best thing is to take everything in such a manner that the other person understands that you are dealing with that person in a very subtle and a beautiful way. You don't just try to be aggressive. Aggressiveness is not the sign of a saint. You have to be very kind, you have to be very gentle, you have to be very sweet and understanding and that they are not yet realized souls, they have just now come to Sahaja Yoga, they are not yet established as Sahaja Yogis. That's the sign of a good Sahaja Yogi. Anything else you want to ask Me you tell Me and I will definitely try to see to you that it works out. There's one thing I've seen how much depth we have that works out the best. Sometimes it is so remarkable. There was one fellow called Alok who came to Me in Madras about one and a half year back only, just a matter and he just jumped into the ocean. He is such a great Sahaja Yogi and then he went down to, then he went down to, he was in Bombay, I think, yeah, he was in Bombay where he received a news from his mother that she was very seriously ill. So went down to Rohtak from Bombay and when he was in Rohtak he found out that his mother was just about to die. The doctor said within three days she is going to die. So he just put My photograph and before My photograph he prayed, Mother, please cure my mother. That's all. And can you imagine in three days she improved so much that he brought her all the way to Bombay. Then he took her, they said it's a serious type of a cancer and he took her to the very famous hospital in Bombay, Tata Hospital for this cancer. And you'll be amazed that they said it's all negative, there's no cancer at all. So it's the, it's the depth within you. It's not the blind faith but the depth, deeply how much you are in Sahaja Yoga and he has been there only one and a half year. And then he said, I want to give up my job. Now what's the use of doing jobs? You say, I'll better do Sahaja Yoga job. I said, you are doing Sahaja Yoga job, all right. Don't give up this job. There's no need to give up anything. So you grow like a tree is settled in the same place but grows in the same way you have to grow and it works out very well. I hope, see, you get this new things are made up. How they express their love, nothing like children in this world I tell you. Now another thing was, You asked Me about a school to be started here, is a good idea. Start a school with that. That will be good for little children and then when they grow up they see what they get out of it. So you see, it's a very good idea. And in a place like that you can have a school. If you have a big basement or something you can have a school, you can have a meditation center there. Meditation room should be separate. Everybody should not be brought to a photograph which has brought the crown and all that, they get a shock. So just have ordinary photographs like this for meditation. But for a meditation room you can have everything you like but for a general center you need not have all these things because they don't like it to be there. And then for the children also you can have there, you can also make it an exhibition room or something like that. And another thing I find that Australia is a very expensive place no doubt, very, very expensive. So I think when you all come to India you should get the list of things that you want to buy from them and buy them. And it's terribly, I mean, you just can't imagine how expensive it is. So all those who are here also you can buy things for them and bring them because I think this is one of the most expensive places. I don't know what Helsinki is, another one, but in some things this is a very expensive place except for food. Food is all right, food is all right. The rest of it is very expensive. So when you come to India remember that you go out shopping nicely and get things for other salubhis also who are left behind. So next time I hope to see you all in Ganpati Puri. I know that Ganpati Puri is rather expensive but you try to put it down a little bit. But as the time is passing you see, every inflation going up and even the food in India is going up. I don't know how to bring it down. But we have kept to the same amount for the last three years and this year maybe we might bring it down a little bit more with some sort of a compromise on things. But for one month in Australia will be much more than in India I can tell you. Only you are travelling is a problem which you should little bit sort out. But the more you, the more the merrier as they say you come along. But I would say still the Australians shouldn't stay together. You should mix with other people, make friendship, you should be able to write letter to us. Because I am talking here about the collectivity of the whole world. And that's what you belong to. Anywhere you go in any place, it's so surprising sometimes how you meet a Sahaja Yogi. Like we had one girl, she went down to Sicily and another one went from I think Austria. And both were sitting in one restaurant. This one was sitting here, another one. And suddenly because of vibrations they were attracted to each other. They didn't know why they were attracted. So one went and talked to the other, a sitter, from where she said, I am from Austria. Then she just put her hand under the table. She said, are you a Sahaja Yogini? Yes, yes. How do you know are you a Sahaja Yogini? Yes, I am. And then the amount of love they felt between themselves. And they describe it so beautifully like a poetry, the whole thing. And they were so happy that in a far-fetched place like Sicily, two girls from two countries meet and they are so very happy, just with vibrations. Same with people when they come, you see sometimes they are not wearing badges or anything. Just with vibrations they know that this is Sahaja Yogi. All over the world you have brothers and sisters. You can never get lost, even if you want to. So that's how it is. Now, you have anything, any problem, you tell Me now about this one marriage you have served. I have no objection to it. But responsibility is more there. But it's not mine so much, right? And the second one is a problem of this lady having two children. She is a Sahaja Yogini and we don't like people staying with somebody like that. We must have our self-respect. Unless and until you are married with someone, if you stay with someone, it's a stigma for you as well as for the children. So I don't think, I don't agree there that you stay with someone without marriage. You see, you don't know how he'll treat you, how it will work out. They have to be Sahaja Yogis because then we can see that they don't misbehave. Of course I wouldn't say that a hundred percent we are successful but at least ninety-nine percent we are successful in our attempt to get very happy, prosperous, beautiful married lives. And without that what's the use all the time, you see, in a struggle, fighting, what's the use? So that would be a better idea is to have a sane thing which is marriage and which is a very sensible thing and which will definitely help you all very much to be settled down. Otherwise you'll be all the time unhappy and insecure. Now those who cannot get married say they cannot come to that particular... But if they can send their photographs and all those things we'll decide there. I mean they can get engaged, they can get married, not such a problem. They can get married here also but they should send the photographs properly and also send there just like anybody else, you see. And supposing, supposing we find somebody for you, they are very good, then we'll send you a message and the collectivity can pay for you to come and you can stay with that person for a month to go. And it works, it works, I must say, more on vibration. Somebody could be this way or somebody could be that way, like a very remarkable thing happened this time that we have a very, very good Sahaja Yogi called as Chris Marlowe, England, very good Sahaja Yogi. And he told Me that he wants to marry an Indian girl but she should be very good in vibration. I said any color, any shape, anything, yes, that is correct, as long as she is a bundle of vibrations, Mother, I don't want anything else. I just, I didn't understand what he was saying. But for his age there was only one girl available and she was from south, very dark. Though I would say she was quite good looking in the sense that to Me, I don't know, with her norms, very dark and little on the plump side. He wanted a plump wife also, that was one thing. He said, I don't want to have bones around My head. So that was all right. But still I would not call her anything beautiful or thing for a western mind or could be ugly, could be ugly. And I told him all this, then see this is the photograph of this girl and this is this. If you like her, if you really want to marry her, really want to marry her, you can marry her. So when he saw her, he just jumped, he said, that's the war, Mother, for me. I was so surprised. I said, why? He said, it's limited. The vibrations from her eyes also, there are vibrations from such innocent eyes. It just fell for her. And he's so, so happy you can't. Why you will find somebody? Because somebody is, I mean I don't know why, just say, I know for some reason. Because they have black hair, somebody has grey hair and I don't like a blonde and I don't like a black hair to a person. All these nonsensical ideas start. They are so superficial. I mean here you can always color it. Except for, and some people will say the nose is long, somebody will say, after all God has made everybody differently. They cannot be one like, they are not plastic things, nothing. So they have to be different and the faces have to be different. But in Sahaja Yoga they have that inner beauty shining in the faces and that you can see. If you understand this point then you won't say no because this is the... But of course if there is any reasons for saying no, I will say, all right, never marry. But even after marriage I have seen people become so crazy and mad. I can't understand what happens to them. Like we had one marriage to a boy who is very good Sahaja Yogi in India. But to a very good looking girl, very, very good looking and I mean a good Sahaja Yogi. And then she went mad. I told you she went amak. She took that boy to Kashmir for a honeymoon. We don't have honeymoon because we have honey and moon everything in Sahaja Yoga. There's no need to go for honeymoon and all that. But she went for a honeymoon and spent two lakhs of rupees of that boy. And then she started asking him for this and that and she started giving all kinds of troubles to the mother-in-law and father-in-law, staying in their house. We must take another house, must get out of it. Within one month's time everybody went crazy and she went into Pune Street to see kissing him, hugging him, oh God, and so embarrassing for others. Sahaja Yogi's they came, Mother, what is this girlie? And the boy also got frightened with her. He said, Mother, please send her away. I just can't bear it. Now she's gone, now she's in group. She said, I was possessed, it was a bhoot. But you blame a bhoot, you're a Sahaja Yogini. How did you get into this kind of a madness? That because he was a rich boy, all right, so you shouldn't get into such a mad idea. You should understand that he's a Sahaja Yogi and you are a Sahaja Yogini. And the whole thing is so absurd now that this boy says, no, Mother, not me, not with her. He spoke so frightened of her. Though she said, now I'm all right, the bhoot has gone this time. I didn't marry her actually, that's one of the points I must tell you. Because there was some sort of a remark about her from the leader. So I just had kept that waiting. I said, let's see, next year we'll see about her. But she stayed back because she was anxious to get married. And they stayed in the same house where these people were living. And she managed him, I think, and then all these things happened and such a problem, such a problem. That boy is completely shattered. He's such a nice Sahaja Yogi. So he also happens like that sometimes and without My knowledge things have happened. But you have to know that whatever you have to think, matter, you have to analyze, whatever, you have to decide should be done before marriage, not after marriage. But before marriage they never think. Mother has said it, all right, we like her. After marriage, oh, this is so, this is so, this is so. It's a funny thing. Once you have taken, it's not a joke, it's not a show, it's not something so cheap as that, you're married. Somebody, you have no business to do in somebody's life like that. They start thinking after marriage is a wrong thing. Before marriage you should decide. That is one of the curses of the Western society, we should not be brought to Sahaja Yoga. We have no right to hurt anyone, no. You decide yourself beforehand, you tell Me last minute, if you tell me I don't want to marry you, it's perfectly all right. But after that when you have married somebody, you have no business to hurt someone. It's sort of a very sinister thing it might come out that you are trying to hurt someone, that's not right. So before marriage you should decide. And after marriage you should accept it and make it a beautiful marriage. You can show to people there are people who we can say have been very, very happily married very well. And also a situation of where the husband is dominating or a wife is dominating and that should not be such. As I have told that you are two wheels of one chariot. But the left is on the left and right is on the right. If you try to fix the left on the right it will be a mess or anyone of the wheels is smaller than the other. They are equal but not similar. Then the chariot will be going round and round. So it is that you have to respect the equality of Sahaja Yoga, Sahaja Yogini and Sahaja Yogini. But also you must know that you are not similar. Woman is a woman and man is a man. And I nice to be woman I sometimes think because poor men have to please so many people in this world and a woman has to just please the husband finished. It's a simpler job. But in any case you should be proud of being a woman or a man. And this fighting with men for what? Fighting with men for jobs and this is not necessary. What is there to fight with men for jobs and for getting this thing better, that thing better. After all it's so materialistic. We should really understand that we are the source of power. We are like this Mother Earth which gives everything and still she is so great. That's how you should have that idea that we are doing everything for the family, for everyone. Of course you can work, you can do what you like but women are the ones who make the society. They don't make politics. If they go to politics they become neither men nor women I think. Women are the ones who make the society. So all that is society you have to look after. That's your job and it's very important I think. Your mother is a woman. I am a married woman, I have got children, I have got my family, I have everything. I have my relations, such huge society, family in my mother's side and my husband's side. We have so many but it's all all right. So nobody should feel inferior because you are a woman and nobody should feel superior because they are men. That's a wrong thing, that's unnatural, that's not so good. So we have to understand each other's dignity, should be respectful to each other, should be kind and wife and husband both of them to be collective. No possessive of each other but to be collective, to be pure, to be nice. There are certain few things you see which we have to understand in Sahaja Yoga and life could be beautiful in us, beautiful. Certain things missing in Indian culture, something missing in Western culture, we have to understand that these both are wrong and we are not going to have them and it will work out very well. For us there's only one culture and that is Sahaj culture and these children are now growing up so we have to prepare ourselves for that, to face them otherwise tomorrow they will put you right. May God bless you! May God bless you! So many will be coming, I'm sure now. Mother, we have a small gift for you. Ah, every time. It's only very small one, Mother. I have some small gifts for you all leaders but that I will give you in the puja, isn't it? All right. You know there is no need to give Me gifts, you are My gifts because now this house of Mine is falling short. I have to keep all my gifts, it's all right. I can open Kundalini, take this. But also it's done so beautifully that you don't feel like opening it. It's a Western Australian pearl, Mother, and we bought it many years ago actually and there was, it's made by, the mould was made by Robin Reed and it was made here in Perth by a local artist. It's beautiful. But don't you think it's too much? It's very beautiful down there, Mother. Such a combination. Is it gold plated or gold? It's gold plated, Mother. Then it's all right. Otherwise gold, again I go into prison in India. All right, thank you very much. Thank you, Mother. It's beautiful. The pearls are very beautiful. Thank you very much. So, very beautiful now. You give it to him, I think, very beautiful. Thank you ever so much. And what I am again saying that you get the measurements of children and ladies and men and whatever they need, you can buy and bring it from there. It's better. Because you see here it's so difficult and you waste your money and these things is not good. So better get things from India. So you get very nice things, sales and things like that. It will be much better, right? All right? Thank you, Mother. I had bought lots of things, I must tell you, for Australians. But they told Me that the customs here are so terrible that I can't bring it. So they got all exhausted. It's a Mother who does. Mother, we also have a poem of things. Yes, please. This day is dear to Me above all other days. Yeah, yeah, lovely. Come here. This is a song from Kabir. Yes, Shri Mataji. This day is dear to Me above all other days. Lovely, everybody should hear. Can you hear us? Give Me this. Pass it. This is a song from Shri Mataji. This day is dear to Me above all other days. This day is dear to Me above all other days. For today the beloved Lord is in the world, and they have become lost in her great beauty. I wash her feet and I look upon her face, and I lay before her as an offering, my body, my mind and all that I have. I am a person of God, and I am a person of God. I wash her feet and I look upon her as an offering, my body, my mind and all that I have. What a day of gladness is that day in which my beloved, who is my treasure, comes to my house. All evils fly from my heart when I see my Lord. My love has touched her, my heart is longing for the name which is Truth. Thus sings Kabir, the servant of all servants. He is so beautiful, so beautiful, so entertaining. And when I did meet Kabir, he writes all this. They are lucky people, aren't they, that we meet each other. So thank you very much. You got this one. Time enough? Please die. Can I get my smiley? Jai! Jai! Jai! Jai! Jai! Jai! Jai! Jai!

Joyous atmosphere. The joy was just surrounding us, pouring on us beautiful waves of vibrations. I have no words to say about you people because I have never expected that Sahaja Yoga will grow to such an extent, specially in the field of drama and music. It's something so remarkable that we all are enjoying like our own family, like our own society. We are a different people than others. We have to understand that. We are not the same like other people who do not know what is joy is. So with this joyous note, I would like you tomorrow to come for the puja. And that puja maybe, I don't know what time they are fixed, whatever time they are fixed is all right. I hope this kind of Guru Puja we'll have every year and we'll all have a very, very nice time. In a Guru Puja people are supposed to be very much in a Spartan way, I should say, or we can say in a sannyasi manner. So even the menu was very, very simple. And I said, what are you doing? Why do you have such a simple menu? They said, this is Guru Puja Mother. Yes, in Guru Puja if she is the Mother, then you better give a good food. They must have very nice food for Guru Puja. And I hope it is so. And everything is working out. So many problems just get solved by themselves. And we had such a successful nice Guru Puja. Next time you all should come here prepared because I'm not the one who's like other gurus who goes on giving Pappasch as they say. But I would love to tell you something very interesting about yourself. Thank you very much. May God bless you.

signify. We'll raise our hearts in truth for our own good. We'd like to raise our hearts in truth for our own good. We'd like to raise our voices from the earth to the earth. We'd like to raise our voices from the earth powerful music at the heartbreaking moment. We'd like to raise our hearts in truth for our own good. Tuyamao waiko ho mai rarti O Singing hallelujah, hallelujah Hallelujah, hallelujah Singing hallelujah, hallelujah I love all the seekers of the earth. Minquino al tu quelis centa todo el de la oleita. We are seeking truth, every man in the world. Ogo pengo lleguía, se habemos trar el centa todo el de la oleita. Because we don't know what we are seeking. And you can see, we fall into many traps. We want some people to tell you that you give up everything. All your money, everything, is there. So you will find out something. Otra vez en si y valcuno di di quede de la chara y pute le vaste di quense por vietar. Give up your money, give up your children and give all the money to the world. This world needs the sake of your family, or the attainment of your workspace or Pell. And you choose what will lead you, a secret place for all those shapes and opinions. Comedianl thin Give playing aOhint. Many seekers are put on the world. You are making the truth and the many answers are very important. The truth is we are not a sport. We are not a swatter. We are not related, neither we are convinced, but you are to be. You have become the spirit. We are not related, the spirit is remaining, but still it will not come into your attention. It has not come into your awareness. We are not related, neither we are convinced, but still it will not come into your attention. We are not related, neither we are convinced, but still it will not come into your attention. Whether you want to be saved or not, you can say this is the last step and your Self has to tell you that He created your energy, you don't have to tell Him anything. You cannot buy and you cannot purchase and you cannot pay for it. You are recovering from it, you are recovering from it. You recover from it, you shall know the habit of human beings. There are lots of things coming from our intelligence. In our collective world we are passing through various fields. We are in need of this humanity because we are in need of the whole world. Like anger, procrastination, psychotherapy, these are all animal sorts. Just for working all these animals in the field. Apart from that, people being sentient and they get the shri Mataji of the human being. This is another problem with human beings that they cannot see themselves and they go on living like that. What does it mean that time comes? When they start thinking, why are you here all these days? That time they are calling your secret spot. As it is, we have to explain about the power that resides in our that we are more than sacred. So when this power rises within you? It happens on things. You don't have to do any drills, you don't have to do any pictures or awkward gestures. It is the hand being quizzed in you and with this hand being quizzed, you shall become one with your Spirit. As a result, you lose all these horrible habits you have as your own medicine. But you become a very great spiritual person. With this happening, you are connected with a Divine power of love. Unless and until you are connected, unless and until you become one with that divine power, how can you combine with it? You see that there are many different ways because if you want to be connected and that connecting point is through this humility, this power within you. This power exists within you also. Whatever comes in the love, whatever color you may have, whatever content you may follow, all these different differentiations do not work out or obstruct at this happens. But when you become one with divine power, it is like the actualization of the You can feel on your hands the cool breeze of the rainforest. You are feeling from now passing your head to the ordinary bone area, this cool breeze comes out. This has become this. After making realization, you may have little bit of love to yourself and little bit of one can be a muscle. You can feel the love of yourself and you can feel the love of your own self. As a result, you will become one with light and personality. You will become one with the personality and the personality of the person in the moment. Any value which is very light, can be light at another time. So you can also enlighten people. These centers about which you are born are responsible for your physical, mental and emotional being. But they are also responsible for your special being. So when the Kundalini passes through these centers, it nourishes you, it nourishes and also it integrates you. Integration is that you become one with the personality. It is not that your brain are to treat your heart or your heart are to treat your emotions. There is a complete harmony establishing you. Your help will do me, not only that, will make you a little bit more beautiful. You are a very beautiful person. I am very happy to be able to meet you. You are very beautiful. You are very beautiful. I am very happy to meet you. But we don't know about this power. We also don't know about ourselves. But when you get this, then you know all your fingertips, what's the matter with you? I think you know how your, that part of your genre, you can get cured by yourself. This is very simple to look at. But it is so vital that it has to be. The second thing that happens to you, that suddenly you find your creativity is in the best. Suddenly you find that you are very satisfied, sir. No more of me. You become very bad personality. So many things happen to you, of which you were never aware. All your fingertips, all your fingertips, you can feel your This is your self-confidence. And if you can blow your chakras, you can go to chakras also. The another thing happens to you, that you become collectively like a drop becomes the flame. You can feel the chakra level and so forth. So who is the level? You come into the ocean of Divine Society. All you come, very surprised, very good people and very young. Ultimately you become thoughtlessly aware. You have talked about it. Actually we live in the past world. We are conditioned by the past world. And that is how we are. But after this happening, you do not react. But you become the witness. The witness of the whole ground. But how it happens that the thoughts are coming from the mass and from the jubilation. The past is created and centered and it exists. We are dancing on the curse of these thoughts. But when the jubilation rises, we now reach the source. The jubilation rises, we now reach the source. We now reach the source. And the space is created. This space is called the government. But actually that is the presence. And that is the purpose. Your attention is the presence. And there is no thought. For example, I see something beautiful to say to this God. Sir? Now if it is mine, I'll be worried what we have to discover. But I have watched as a witness. I don't react. And the joy continues. This was made by the artist. In thoughts, I don't react. It seems that it has created. Can you describe it like this? Can you write about the government, please? You go into the North-Shree area. You have also described, while I see, He said, all my ideas come from the North-Shree. I will find a statement and find out the truth. It is the truth. It has changed the ideas come and realized from the North-Shree. What a political statement and find out. And He surprised. That is the truth. Now the truth is love and love is good. If you love somebody, you go into the water and process. But this is the love I'm talking about, which is the mind. It doesn't expect anything from others. It just knows that you are all capable of getting that Shree. It is not at all anyway difficult because you don't love somebody. He's powerful to me and He drives me without any problem, spontaneous. But if you have been to a rock-type room, then you just take time. Because they definitely feel obstacles in your ascending path. Actually you have to become your own master, your own. After knowing the reality. So, with all these powers you can do so much to others. Apart from that, we go to others, you go to yourself. You become a person full of joy and complete equality of mind. It's not extremely mischievous and there is all the time to mention. This is not meant is something very well made in very much the right way for you, but the time is gone. The time has come for you to get it. You are a special guy. The special time I go to is the last session. Now, you are a special person. I am a genius. You are a special person. You are a special person. The diamonds are very valuable things as we see how many are raised at the city's back. You are a special person. Also we have seen rural people who are very poor, very unkind. Also people who are being three-week and all things of bad things. You become a realized soul and nobody will touch you. If you are keen to be amazed, we have two thousand soldiers. They were all Muslims and some of them were automatic Muslims. When I told them the reality of the problems, they were all a real soul. I think it's a real soul. Now, it is unquaintly surprising. None of them, not one person was born by this unquaint all of these people. Not to see that, but even their houses were not touched. It's a fact you can be quiet. So you are not having a feeling. And when you start feeling this love within, this love of the world, again I say, it's now very important. I know the depth of your realization and growing. You don't have to pray. You don't have to stand on your head. You don't have to give up your family money. Such a thing that has to happen. In this lecture I now describe the details, all that you can have out of your realization. But one thing is definite that you have to have transformation. I understand that this has transformation, you can never be pleased with it otherwise. You can never enjoy life. Automatically you understand what is good for you and what is bad for you. I never say you don't dream anything like that. Even better is having your own life. There is no looking yourself at all. Automatically it works for babies. So you all can have that experience. You can have that experience. You can have the experience of being a human being. Being a human being is a human being. Thank you. Together please. Thank you. That's just all. This is also a time when you ask the school and this too. But the entire people are extremely alone and not normal. They are still in the one hand out and they are still doing great sacrifice. They are still doing great sacrifice. They are still doing great sacrifice. You have to be complete. I am trying to all my kids, five people, I was also so soon will be in here. I would like to ask you a question, five questions, and a few suggestions on the other side. Another one, Alzheimer's. I can ask you a question on the side of Alzheimer's. Yes, please. It is a very beautiful person. Do you have any questions? If you have any questions, please ask. Do you have any questions? I have no questions. Thank you. I would like to say that, if you have any questions, you can ask in the front, in the front. It is very important to us. What are you talking about? It's something very important. She is your Mother. She is your grandmother. It's your thinking your mother. She knows everything about you. She knows about your past. She knows about your future, your aspirations, your values. I say, think like a baby boy. Think. Think. And when she rises, she is your mother. When you were born, who took the trouble, your mother or her? So, all people have written that it's very dangerous, because they don't know all of us. There was one gentleman who became very old. Why tell him? I have been doing this for the last ten years. But I have never seen anybody suffering. I have seen him with all these experiences, and I have never seen him suffering. I would like to say that the experience is very important to those who are suffering, to those who are living in the world, and those who are living in the world. I would like to say that the experience is very important to those who are living in the world, and those who are living in the world. Thank you. If you are suffering, please give some message. If you are suffering, please give some message. They don't want to do anything for you. They are self-conscious. They are full of arrogance and extreme demons. One can deal with people who are real seekers. They don't know. And if you are suffering, they might look at you. It is as I said in the last lesson, and if they want, they can come and tell you. They are not so serious. It has to be asked for. This Kundalini is the power of the pure inside. For example, you have a desire to go to the temple, you have a house. You were taught to have a house, but you are not satisfied. You want to have a house. I don't know how to say it. You are not satisfied. That means you are not living your life. But what does it feel like to feel so free? It feels so free, which is the whole thing. I don't know how to say it, but the Kundalini presents a lot of the scenarios of your life. One minute, please. One minute. Yes, I have a question for you, Mother. I have a question for you, Mother. I have a question for you, Mother. I have a question for you, Mother. What is the meaning of the Kundalini? How can you recognize the Kundalini? Firstly, they ask you for money. Secondly, they want you to give up your family. They want you to wear such a good dress, all in the sight of a person. What is the meaning of the Kundalini? It is a very important thing. It is a very important thing for the family, for the people, for the people who are in the world. This is the meaning of the Kundalini. There are many other signs. What is the meaning of the Kundalini? After realization, you put hands, and then your hands start burning. Why do you put hands? After realization, you put your hands in the center of the heart, and you put your hands in the center of the heart. You are the person who is in the center of the heart. That's it. So what are you doing? You are a very powerful person. And you want this message from results, these premonitions of what happened at the Gopu J staff, the people's construction team, from their time of workNot only was this information an institution, but also an art, a spiritual, real message. Yes, somebody blocked the block also. You can talk to that person and if he let us know where he is, he has sent us all over the world also. We didn't talk about the world ever somewhat because we wanted to see again. But this could have been the form integrar or whatever that way. We have a very good center also in the land. You must be beside, you should obey. You see a paper on a bear of a, she's not obey, she have paper. Yes, you can, but first of all, to go for the center, become a real master, then you will be. Your attention will then guide you. But these days you will be forced into the point of view. I can only speak in Spanish, but I can speak in English. If you want to be a real master, you must go to the center. If you have somebody who wants to be a real master, you don't have to. You don't have to. So you can again. Then you'll be a real leader. I can't forget. With all my respect, I want to ask you, sorry, my name is being Italian, so good. I want to ask you, what do you think about life or energy in a normal planet if you think we are a piece of the sun outside the world, and all of the universes really exist? I think we are a piece of the sun outside the world. You should be able to take us now. All right? You should be able to take us now. I think that if we are a part of the universe, if we are a part of the universe, then we are a part of the universe. Thank you. Nobody stays with the most realization. You should say that. That's more important than any other realization. Shri Mataji, this is the most important thing and what is the most important thing in the world. Thank you. The most important thing is to be aware of the things that are inside us. We are aware of the things that are inside us. We are aware of the things that are inside us. Shri Mataji, I think you are all aware of the things that are inside us. All right, I'll let you go later. All right? You are the last one to tell me, but just now you can feel yourself realized. I have been told that I don't want to be in the world, but I have to be aware of the things that are inside us. I think it's helpful. I'll spend more time with you. I think you all get your realization first and then you should ask Me also. Now one thing I must say, those who don't want to have this realization cannot be moved. So something will be lived about. I don't understand. I don't understand this experience. I don't understand. I don't understand. I don't understand. I don't understand this experience. One thing I would request that they don't push you because this Mother Earth is not. I want to ask you a question. I have to ask you a question. I have to ask you a question. Now, just put your hands like this also. Please. Put both the feet on the ground. Now put the right hand towards Me like this and the left hand on top of your head on the front of your head. Right hand towards Me and the left hand on top of your head. Left hand on top of your head. Last one. Everybody has to put it. Now see, if there is a move or a change, you can put it on the right hand. Now see, if there is a move or a change coming out of your head, on the one hand, you can put it on the other hand. Right hand, right arm, just try to reach it. Now put your left hand towards Me now and put your right hand on top of your head. You can bend your head. Bend your head. Now, put your right hand towards Me. Just see, if there is a cool breeze or a hot breeze coming out of your head, you have to do something with everyone. You have to do something with everyone. You have to do something. Forgive everyone. You forgive yourself also. You should not feel me. Please forgive me. Please forgive me. Please forgive me. But whether you forgive or not, please forgive. Please forgive me. But why not forgive you, Lord Shri Mataji? But why not forgive you, Lord Shri Mataji? Now, please put both your hands on Me, like this. Ask one of these questions, one of these questions. See that. You can call me Mother because she is Mother. Ask the question, Mother, is it the pure breathing of the Holy Ghost? Or second question, you can ask the speaker and second question, you can ask, Mother, is it the all-pervading power to wind down? Or the third question, you can ask three times, is this the power of Jainan? Now, think of your hands. So, you can look like this. Okay. But now, you won't speak without thinking. Try not to think, just watch. All those who have felt cool breeze or hot breeze on their heads or on the feet of groups or in the arms or on no-put-wound head, cool or hot head, please let go of the hands. You have to do something, you have to do something, you have to do something, you have to do something, you have to do something, you have to do something. That's will I, bring all these books. All of you are my people, what a great people. Thank you very much. All these books. I will say that there is a very nice one, it's named this city.

There is within us that power in the character of hope is called a sacrum which is awakened and can connect with the divine. Now this power that we believe is in the sacred world that present means here is the sacred world. Now the problem is only how to awaken this power which is light in the spirit. So the truth is that you are not this world, you are not this mind, you are not these emotions of intelligence, but you are the spirit, the self. Now, one fundamental truth is that we are not in our physical body, nor in our mental health, nor in our mental health, nor in our emotions. We are the spirit of the spirit. This is the last evolutionary process that we all have to do. And the spirit of the spirit is the most important thing in our spiritual life. When this power we move right, it passes through six centers which are responsible for your physical, emotional and mental health. When this power we move right, it passes through six different centers and energetically, which control our own physical, emotional and mental health. This side is for days, that's why it's not self, it's one within. It's not a way to get any more of the spiritual life, but it's not a way to get any more of the spiritual life. It's not a way to get any more of the spiritual life. I'm very tired. You get very serious. It's not just talking about you, but the experience, actual experience of self-realization. That means you can feel a good dream on your fingers, as in the Bible they say, that the disciples felt the truth of the Holy Ghost. And we have heard about the lives of the Holy Ghost. And the experience of the spiritual life that we have experienced, the spiritual life that we have experienced, the spiritual life that we have experienced, that means you can feel that it is actualization of the spiritual life. and naturalization of the spiritual life. It's not artificial, it's a reality. It's not a reality. It's a reality. And every human being has a right. Yes. You can have it now directly. And all the days to be one person of millions is to get such a light. But today the reason of our world is that it should happen collectively, maybe. But the time is now, they are not paying for it. Because the Divine doesn't take us to have money. That's why when people charge money for all such feats, you should know there's something wrong. That's why you should always pay for those who are paying for you. Of course you can pray for the hall, you can pray for your chairs, but you can't pray for your socialization. Yes. It is very important, because the time has come for all of you to get self-realization. It is important to understand that the time is mature to achieve all of you. And this is what is the last judgment. You have to decide whether you want your daily life in any part of it. And you have to decide whether you want your hands to feel the cool breeze. And also on top of your fontanel, you can feel the cool breeze coming out of you. You have to decide whether you want your hands to feel the cool breeze. You have to decide whether you want your hands to feel the cool breeze. You have to decide whether you want your hands to feel the cool breeze. But it's surprising. With this happening, when the cool breeze passes through the same cycle, your physical problem, mental problem, emotional problem, and spiritual problems, all that's all. And when all of this happens, when the cool breeze is activated, automatically the problems of physical, emotional, physical, and spiritual problems are resolved. This happens to you because you become the Self. And this happens to you because you become the Self. And all the six enemies that we have within us just drop out. These six enemies, these six-fellic enemies are like iron, green, rust. All these just drop out. These six enemies, these two enemies, they are like iron, and they become the pure Self. And you become the pure Self. They become the pure Self. And we become the pure Self. That's what you are. Because you are. So it's a matter of life for you. And so it's a matter of life for you. And so you get yourself the Self. So you should understand how precious it is that you should know yourself. So you should understand how precious it is that you should know yourself. But with this happening, you don't have to give up anything outwardly. There are many people who teach you. Give up your family. Give up your money. Give up your partner. Every sort of thing they try to teach you. deadline. Show the group that you have to go back, cause you may not want to give. You may dare amfully.... If you not going back, you think you need to give up something random. So you have to be reading Your way. You may not want to put it. You may not go. and you make it feel like you are not able to feel it. You have to know that you have a right to get yourself a light. And how vital it is today in these modern times when we find all kinds of problems coming up. In short, human beings must be transformed. So, it is a transformation that must be made in the human beings. Transformation into another beautiful self which is full of love and compassion. This transformation will change the whole attitude. And this transformation will change completely the whole society. Because on your fingertips you can feel yourself, in your centre, you can feel yourself. because you will know what is wrong with you, that is self-knowledge. On your fingertips you will know. And then, you will also know how to correct it. and you will know what is wrong with you, that is self-knowledge. And you will know what is wrong with you, that is self-knowledge. On your fingertips you will know. and you will know what is wrong with us. And you will know how to correct it. You will know how to correct it. and how to correct the problems. There is a new dimension that comes into your awareness which we call as collective consciousness. That is, you know, about others also, what kind of centre is catching them. You know, on your fingertips. Now, if you can cure yourself, you can cure other people. You can cure others. Thousands and thousands of people have been cured with Sahaja Yoga treatment. So many suffering from drug addiction, alcoholism have become completely cured. People who are sick and alcoholists, etc., have been cured. Despite all that, it takes time for people to understand that within you is the power which has to be awakened. people have told them about Kundalini. You have been already told about this power, Kundalini, which is made of three and a half coils. that's why it is called as Kundalini. And the centers are like flowers which are enlightened. Also, it is said, in the Bible itself that I appear like flames of very silence. That's what it is. Very simple. And absolutely without any kind of hazardous methods. We see all the problems in the world are caused by the ignorance of the human beings. that ignorance has to go. Now in this hall, supposing there is no light, you will not know how to walk out, you will not know who is sitting in the street. But when you are radit, you can see everything very clear, man and suddenly you find yourself in the world with wisdom, with love and compassion. I would like to talk to you for hours together, there's no end to it and I have already given, I don't know, thousands of lectures in all kinds of matters. But the only thing you have to ask yourself is if you really want to know yourself, and then you go beyond the mind. Because the thought comes to us through our reactions to this. Because the thought comes to us through our reactions to this. Through our traditional aim of all. Because the thought comes to us through our reactions to this. Through our traditional aim of all. Through our thinking. And this is the one we have to ask. And we can see. That's it. That's it. That's it. And we can see. But when you become one with the all-porevated divine power, you do not react. But you become a witness. You see everything as a witness. You do not criticize. For example, this beautiful� 얼굴 there's a beautiful bạn. No, I look at everything. Without the room. In言葉 non 보성цы. and Jung has said about it. Then what happens? I just watch. I'm a witness. Otherwise I might think who uses it, how much it has cost, should I ensure? I can't believe it. I can't believe it. I can't believe it. But if I just watch, if I just watch, then the joy that the artist has put in this carpet, I will enjoy it. So another direction comes within us that will become thoughtlessly aware. This is the sign of a sin. For which you don't have to wear your precious to announce. Because you are detached, there's no need to do that. You don't have to abandon your family. You don't have to give up anything. You don't have to go to the earth. Because you are above, like the lotus is above the water. We need the whole world giving beautiful fragrance to everyone. We are here for a very beautiful world. And for a very, very beautiful life. all the problems, so far, all the quarrels, all the fights, all the wars are finished. and all the wars are finished. All the wars are finished. All the wars are finished. All the wars are finished. And all the wars are finished. Who is the other? You become part and parcel of one being. In this total integration, we are all part of the same being. Like a drop, we exist with limitations. But when a drop falls into the ocean, it becomes the ocean. Because a water is filled with a water. It becomes the ocean. I told you, you don't have to pay, but you have to understand your own value. you have to respect yourself by which you become a beautiful personality emitting all the types of joy to others. Your intelligence becomes emotional. And all your life is changing as if a great weather of transformation is now. We have to save our children, we have to save our families, we have to save our society, we have to save our country and we have to save the whole world. For which you don't have to take a sword in your hand, with the sword of love and the sword of compassion. So you forget the past, the future is also finished, and also the future doesn't exist. But you stand in the present, which is the reality. And like a great successful personality, you watch the whole world to be given this love. you become creative, extremely creative. in which way that you make others self-realized. That is how Sahaja Yoga is spread in 86 countries. Even in Africa, seven countries like Benin, Ivory Coast, seven countries have taken to Sahaja Yoga. It's such a global power. because you become a global person. because you become a global person. because you become a global person. all the dynamics of your personality just dissolves. you become a global person. You become a global person. you become a global person. You become a global person. There are so many things you need to go to. but first you must get yourself a special way. I know you have questions, but I would request you to write down your questions and I try to answer them later on, by later. Whether it is personal or about anything, you can live in a dream like a dream. Because this time has come, it's a special time, I call it the lost time. There are so many people who are, like the flowers, who have to just bring out the fruits. And so many flowers are here, which are pronti to become fruit. You will become completely perfected and become a full subversiality. And so you can achieve this kind of perfection. It's a religion of yourself. It should make you understand that all these religions came over for the same folks. But they are lost, that man. Some are lost in malicity, some are in power. That's not the evil. Some are for the same people, some are for the same people. Some are for the same people, some are for the same people. The aim is to know yourself and to know others. I gave Italy because I think in the whole of Europe the Italians have a very large heart. Not only that, but they are very creative. So I have had your disposal and we now, after this, try to end the experience of self-realization. Now I would request to you, those who don't want to have self-realization should take the whole. Because I cannot force you, you have to ask for it. Kundalini is your pure desire. Because all the other desires cannot satisfy you. Because all the other desires cannot satisfy you. Because all the other desires cannot satisfy you. If you have one thing and you get it, then you want to another thing. you have to pray for you, and you get it. At the end, if you have one thing, you do not Oczywiście, if you even come ANY twelve thirsty arero-ish, whom you are saying birds not in the same time. You do not speak till word is 21. mozzarella'dor, yeah? that your pure desire. Thank you, Adolf. The truth is that if someone is not interested or interested in doing this, it will also be out. If the others will remain relaxed. They will not be able to do this. It will not be any problem. It will not be any problem. They won't have to be able to do it. Because they are just ready. Because they are ready. The party can't help you. It's so simple as that. That's so simple. Thank you. It must be. It must be. I have a very upset and I have to ask you to please take out your shoes because this Mother Earth is a great athlete. So, let's take them a story and take soul, jump you a little bit, then sit back together part of the Mother Earth, soern said that Mother Earth has a particular force of very Now, if you have been feeling guilty, you are having yourself very much. Now, when you feel guilty, you start catching on the sign of the sense. In the long run, you develop a cold light or an angel. If you have been guilty, if you have done anything wrong, that's the past. Forgetting. As I said, you have to be in the present. Another very important thing is that you have to forgive. First of all, yourself by not feeling guilty. And also, you have to forgive others. Some people say it's very difficult. It's very difficult. But whether you forgive others or don't forgive others, what do you do? Logically, you don't do anything. But if you don't forgive, then you all the time torture yourself by playing into wrong hands. So, the best thing is to forgive them and forget about them. It's very important. It's very important. It's very important. But the center here also gets into trouble if you do not forgive others. It's also because the center of the angel, which is placed here, the center of the front, could be blocked. But for which you don't have to do anything. You have to stay with the same, the center of the mother and the mother and the mother and everything. It's very simple. So, please put your hands on the screen like this. And I'm gonna keep going to the center of the two cables. The answer is 5, 6, and 7 centimeters. Because the center is out of the one of the correct self-honètres. On the left, also the same five, six, seven, six. You just put your hand like that. So, put your hand like this. Again, I would request you to forgive yourself and forgive others. Now, you bend your hand and raise your left hand on top of the fontanelion area which was the soft bone in your triangle. You can move and see for yourself if there's a cool breeze coming out of your fontanelion area which was the soft bone in your triangle. You can move and move your hand like this. You can move and move and move and move and move and move and move. So, I would like to see if you can see if you can see a fresh breeze coming out of your triangle. You can see if you can see a fresh breeze coming out of your triangle. You can see that you can see if you can see a fresh breeze coming out of your triangle. Now, please forgive. I would like to forgive yourself and forgive others. I would like to forgive others. Now, with the left hand towards me and with the right hand bend your hand and see for yourself if you can see a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your corner and move. Invertiamo le mani, la sinistra del suo scendale di la destra sopra la destra. E vediamo se percepiamo il calore o il fresco che fuoriesco dentro la testa. If it is hot, that means you have not forgiven yourself or not forgiven us. If it is hot, that means you have not yet could forgive you. It is from your being that it comes out. Because this aparenza is emanating from you, from your being. Now, again, with the right hand towards me and see for yourself. You can close your eyes. You can close your eyes. It's so easy. If there is a cool or a hot breeze, you can see all your fault needs or health. If there is a hot breeze. You can close your eyes. If there is a hot breeze. Now, please raise your hands with me. and so, with two hands, like this, and so on. Some people might have a little breath from below, like this, maybe. You can lift it up like this. Move it like this. And so, with the shoulders of the bar, you have to do this movement to bring it to the bar. To bring it to the bar. All those who have had good trees on their fingertips, on your palms, or out of the fountain, please. Please, please, please, please, please. All right. Allora, tutti coloro che hanno percepito una brezza calda oppure fresca sulle mani oppure sulla testa alzino entrambe le braccia. Oh, look. Just see yourself, in your hands. All of them. What about those who are sitting there? The whole of Milano has much centralization. Thank you. Some of you might not have that. That's not it. It's alright. You have to let them come to our programmatic followers and get them. Also those who have to come and know all about it, and they have to come to know something. So that you... So that you become masters. And you can hear more people who have self-help. And you can hear more people who have self-help. You can do it. And you can do it. And you can do it. Yes. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for everybody. You're clapping for vibration please. We are clapping for vibration school, school vibration school is... So, we have a song, it is written, 16th century or so, by a voice. In India, we say that, O Mandala Kundalini, please rise, so.

How many times in five hundred minutes? See, it's all so sudden. Everything is worked out and comforting, permitting power of God. He is arranged and He's done something so subtle and so clear. But for that, two things is that one has to get realization. And what is realization? It is that another depth of it is all thought and feeling. It's the subtle of the detail, you can say, you understand. But it's the subtle in all the, all the things that you see here. Usually it's the way to be self-diagnosed. Self-diagnosing has variations. It's in a tree, it has to be kept. Therefore, who does that? Who does? Now in our body also we say, auto-numbers. Whatever I'm told you about is fallen fruit. Indeed, I have heard about it. Now will you sit down? On the ground, I would like to talk to you. Yes, please. It's Mother's culture. All right. I have a very heavy accident. Well, she told me just now. Be careful. She is giving something more to sit on. She is giving something more to sit on. Where was it sitting? Yes, it was sitting on the ground. Should we sit like this, Mother? Okay. All right. I'm so happy that there's somebody who is positive, who is like himself. See, it's the first. This all-pervading power, which is in the Sanskrit language called as Paramachankhaya. In the power of the Adishya. Adishya is the desire of God Almighty. All living work is done by this Paramachankhaya. For example, you see flowers. You see the flowers with green fruits. You see so many miracles in life. But we accept them as a product, because it is something for us is so mundane, every day we see it. Even if you see your own eye or anybody's eye, it's like a camera. So who has made all this? Who has evolved even then? This question should come to us. Then we talk about autonomous consciousness. We say there is an auto-villainess. Who is this auto? See, automobile. Then there has to be somebody who is driving it. So this is the spirit, the villainess, the stars, no doubt. But the energy that he has is the energy which is all-pervading, God as first. So in such a language we call it the power of the power of his life. That power when developed ego, it becomes the Adishya-Priya, the primordial mother. And that primordial mother's power is this Paramachankhaya. And she is the desired power of God. And within us lies the power of pure desire, which we call as Kundalini, in the Sahasri clan. So this is the reflection of the same Adishya-Priya, which is the Holy Ghost. But the Christians cannot relate it, we say to that. Holy Ghost, if you ask them they won't be able to explain. But Holy Ghost is the primordial mother. I described, say, in the Greek mythology as Athena, Athena in Sanskrit means primordial, from which the word ascends us. So this resides in the triangular bone, which is called as Sekhra. Again the Sekhra means sacred. So it means that we know about it, that there is a sacred bone within us, which has the sacred Holy Power, which is of pure desire. This Kundalini has to rise, and this Kundalini has to rise and pierce through six centers, not seven, six centers, though there are basically seven centers, and has to pierce through our fontanel bone area for the actualization of baptism, what we call as Brahma-Randra. Through this it has to come. Now described by Adishankaracharya, it is described in India since long, because it is described even by Markandeya, whose dates we cannot say, maybe 14,000 years. They have talked about it. But in the Gita also, Sri Krishna did not mention particularly about Kundalini, but he said that you meditate and do this and do that. But he talked about Self-realization. But later on the poets, in the 12th century we had Ganeshwara, great poet, who wrote treatise on Paramachaitanya, beautiful one, Amruta-Anubhav, beautiful one. It's not a translated, and I think even if it is translated, it will be beyond the heads of people, because at least to minimum they have to have Atmubuddha, they have to have this Self-realization. That may be the reason that Uddha never talked about God. He said, better talk about only Self-realization, because talking about God is a later idea. First of all talk about Atmubuddha. So he talked in the sixth chapter clearly about Kundalini, 12th century Indian. Namadeva talked about it. He was another poet who wrote folk songs. Yesterday they sang that song, folk song, who talked about this Kundalini which has to rise and which has to give you realization. Now this, all this knowledge was there, but not worked out. It was at the time of Sri Rama, you know his father in law was Janaka, father of Sita. And Janaka was a great saint, and in his lifetime he gave realization to one person called Nacchiketa. But recently they showed a film of Rama and in that they showed that Rama was told about Kundalini by his Guru and he talked to him about Kundalini. Can you imagine now their thing? So this knowledge of Kundalini existed since long. It is like a connection with the divine. You see as your computer is to be put to the mains, you see. In the same way you have to be put to the mains. Move it forward, come forward. So this knowledge though available was not practicable. And it was my own vision you can call it or life I call it or advent whatever you want to call it, that I had to discover a method by which I could give a mass realization. It has to be a mass. It cannot be pertaining to one person. Because if it's one person nobody understands. What is he talking about? Like my father was realized soul and he knew about me. So he told me, you must take people from this first floor at least to the second floor so that they realize there is really something, it's not mythical, that God is mythical and his ideas of saintliness all this is mythical. So you have to work out something by which you can give a mass realization. And he knew that I have to do this job. So I started, there is a way of entering in a very subtle way into my attention into people to see what are their problems, what the problems human beings have. Because it is already predicted in our another books called as Nadi Granth. Nadi Granth which was written by Bhrugamuni who was the originator of our horoscopes and things like that. He was the one, Bhrugamuni. So he wrote a book called Bhrugusangita for general people and one book he wrote as Nadi Granth in which he has mentioned that in Kalyoga Paramachaitani itself is going to get a form and is going to give realization to people, a mass. And nobody could have believed it till it has started happening. So the reality is that no use talking about God because it's not reality. You have to become one with that divine power. For example, you may follow any guru, you may follow any religion, you may follow any philosophy. But everybody commits the sins, alright? No restrictions. Can take to any bad habit. Can be very harsh, can be very cruel, can be horrid and can be just like an animal. So how is it, where did we feel? Where do we feel there is a mistake? And the mistake is like that. That all the religions have said that seek the eternal. This is the essence of all the religions, whatever they may say. Seek the eternal and the transitory is to be treated in its own limitations and understanding. But what we did was to look after the transitory, nobody thought, talked of seeking the eternal. And there people have only interested money. So much so you'll be surprised that when I say you can't pay for it, they don't like me. Even Boston they asked me how much, how many Rolls Royce's you have? I said I have none. I said don't have none. Then we are not interested, it's no business. You see, so the whole mind... You know the western people only see one example of what lived in Pune. You know that. And now he has confessed I am told that he is before people. They are all like that. I tell you, but people must understand one warning Christ has given that rich will never enter into the kingdom of God. The reason was they think they can purchase God and they are misleading people like that. I know of someone who recently came to Boston, not to Vancouver when I was there. I actually collected 1.6 million and when I was there they came to me and I said, what did you get? Nothing, they got kind of a some sort of a reeling feeling. I said are you paying for reeling feeling? I have seen all of them now. I know them very well. They are all against me. They never talk against each other. Never, because we don't have to be people who should mislead us. These beautiful seekers was who have come on this side. From the year 1970 I have been talking aloud, telling them about who is this Rakshasa, who is that Rakshasa, who is this whom the God has had killed. Everybody's names had given the Rakshasa's names. But Sahaja Yoga is something where your Kundalini has to rise and you have to become something. You cannot pay, you cannot pay back. Now all right, my husband is a rich man, all right, take it like that, or my family is rich, all right. So I use that money for Sahaja Yoga. But supposing I was poor, so it's all right. For a person who is a realized soul, he doesn't seek comfort. He has this comfort of his heart and how it works out. It had to happen, it is happening. You'll be amazed to know that now slowly and steadily in all dignity and in proper way Sahaja Yoga has achieved now, thirty nations are doing Sahaja Yoga. Thirty nations are doing it and now we are going to Russia also. Ultimately we are invited by the health minister, so we are going to Russia last. But I've been to Turkey, can you imagine? And in Turkey the Muslims have become now Sahaja Yoga's. And in Algeria we have a barrister here, is he here or not? He went away also. From Algeria we have a barrister here, who is a realized soul. So now you see because it's a real work, it's not artificial like producing some plastics. So naturally it has to take time. Whatever it is, I tell you this is the time special time, as you call it, new age. It's a new age and there are people who are really honestly seeking the Divine. And whatever you may say, you give me your money, you give me your wife, you give me your house, they give everything for that. But you can't purchase. You can't pay for it. And that's why they are all after my life. And they think that whatever I'm doing is wrong. The other day they sent a letter, how can Mataji raise the Kundalini of people, is that I can. No doubt. Not only of people but of many people, of thousands of people. This time in Delhi we had 12,000 people. About 10,000 people got realization. In Noida we had 15,000 people. There to about 12,000 people got realization. How do you define realization? How all these people around me realize? Of course. And you will get realization also today. I'll give you the realization to begin with first of all. That's how you met me. And there are many signs in Sahaja Yoga, which you can ask them, they'll tell you later. Many signs to prove what I am and what is Sahaja Yoga. Actually you can see the rises of the Kundalini and some people. They make a rise also, if there is an obstruction. If there is no obstruction, rises just like a jet. But there is obstruction, then you can see the pulsation. Now Delhi University has accepted this, that which Sahaja Yoga people get here. We have so many examples. Actually I never used to note it down whom I cured and all that. But now the time has come, so we have collected lots of good time. And the Delhi University people are very much enamored. And there are three doctors who have done the thesis on Sahaja Yoga. And they've got it right for MD. One on physical ability and second on epilepsy, asthma and third is psychosomatic diseases. And they have been accepted. So it has to come, it has to come in a way, it has to come in a way, that you should see to the disciples, how are they? Have they got any powers or not? Or they're just hanging on to a guru and dependent on Him. And because we have a background in India. You see, here there's no background. The main way they have made Christ also. They're Christ, I don't know what to say. They don't understand Christ at all. Have you heard about Saint Thomas' book which has come as Gnostic, in which he has described Sahaja Yoga completely. I read it, I read it. See, completely. See now. So it flouts all their ideas of sufferings and nonsense and not to marry and all these nonsense. Very abnormal. But for example last weekend I was at Haraldsbach, another Bavaria, where there's the operation site of Virgin Mary. And the people who have been there reported a lot of miracles, where the Holy Spirit coming as a cool wind. Really? Cool wind? Yes, cool wind. They saw the Virgin Mary, they saw the Goddess and whatever. The Church has forbidden the Catholics even to enter this place. It is quite possible. You know my photographs have appeared in the sky also, they've taken photographs. Yes. Yes, I see there are so many. There are lots of photographs of miracles of mine also. That's a light in the hand, light at my face. Yes, you are doing strange things, you know. Appearing somewhere on marine clouds, on various places. I always go to the market because you can leave vibrations in that place, where the individual is coming, going. So he said, Mother, please come, you just, even if you don't want to buy something, want you to go around. So I went into them also to see the faces of Mary as faces. Now according to Sahaja Yoga, Christ's Mother Maria was Mahalakshmi. She was Mahalakshmi. She was not an ordinary woman. She was Radha. Radha took form in the Devi Mahatma, if you see in the, see if you have to understand about Goddess, you must read Devi Mahatma. It's written by Markandeya, it's wonderful. In that he has written that Radha, what the son was Christ, absolutely described, fully. And he is the incarnation of Sri Ganesha. And this Mahalakshmi is the one with the central path, asusumna, through which you get your ascent. Now they know all Mahalakshmi stotra, everything very well. But if you just close your eyes, don't want to see anything else, it's a money-making proposition, that's why. It's a money-making proposition. What rule does Sri Ganesha play in your spiritual path? I see many, many images of Lord Ganesha's party here in this room and I think it could be right, was as a connection to your path. What role does he play? I have one of my other two, a very big one. See Ganesha is the symbol that appears. Have you got a Kundalini's photograph or something? Kundalini's photograph. Is the word. I'll show you. Sri Ganesha is the symbol of eternal child because his body is human and his brain is of an animal. An animal never develops his ego. So an animal is a child, absolutely in essence. So he is the symbol of innocence within us. That's why he is placed here, below the Kundalini. You see exactly here. Now why? Because this is the center which caters to the plexus called as pelvic plexus and the pelvic plexus does all our excretion, inclusive of our sex. So Sri Ganesha, the innocence is placed there like a lotus and he looks after all these things. And he is the innocence. With the help of Sri Ganesha, actually you can say that she resides in all these because Sri Ganesha is the form of Omkara. Omkara is the power of Sri Ganesha which was created by Adi Shanti by Pramodian Mother as the first child or first symbol through which auspiciousness and holiness would spread in her creation. So the first thing she did was to first spread auspiciousness and holiness in her creation through this symbol of Sri Ganesha. So Sri Ganesha is here. And now the same Sri Ganesha's power is expressed in all these centers but when he comes here it's the incarnation. In the brain, all these deities who have been our milestones in our evolution in the brain they become as avatars, so he is Christ. Now it is a very scientific thing we have discovered. I told them once that carbon. So in the carbon atom, this Sri Ganesha is made of carbon atom. So you put the carbon atom under microscope and take a photograph of its arrangements. So I told them that if you see it from right, Johan is here? No, we have scientists who told you. From the right side if you take a photograph, on the left hand side you see the swastika but proper. There are two types of swastika. One is the other way round and one is this way. So this way is for construction, the other way round is for destruction. All right? So if you have the swastika on the left hand side, if you see from the right side, if you see from the right side, left hand side is you see swastika. When it's left hand you see swastika. If you see from the left hand towards the right hand, so on the right hand you see as Omgara, seed. But if you see it from down upward, then you see it as glass. It's scientifically proven. To be sure, the swastika who brings destruction is what one Hitler used. Yeah, now what happened? Hitler was guided by Lama. In the beginning? In the beginning. And beginning and end also but Lama told him that if you use swastika, nobody can destroy him. That's a fact. So he used the swastika which is the right swastika like this, which is for construction. He was meaning. But you see God knows how to play tricks. So what happened that they were using stencil? Shablon. Stencil, you see. So with the stencil it got spoiled this side. So they turned it round. That's the trick of what? But war has done such a lot of damage to all of us, no doubt. It has, we don't want war anywhere. We don't want such people to talk of war. It's true. But now people have learnt a lesson also. They want, they have to learn a lesson. Otherwise it doesn't go into their heads, you see. The head is like a, I don't know what should I call it, it's like a stone. So it has to be hit by something. Now these politicians and all these people have learnt a lesson that war is horrible. Still, I mean in their brains still there is an idea of war, but that has to go. We want peace. We hope so. No, we have to have peace. Now we can't afford to have one. Now only the peace to get it is to become the self, because self is the source of peace. They talk of peace foundation, this, that, but there's no peace. How can they give peace? So you have to have your transformation. The whole humanity has to emancipate, but whole cannot. In evolutionary process only one or two fishes came out. Then twenty came out, then thirty came out, then shawls of them. In the same way in this evolutionary process I find now there are lots of people who have come to Sahaja Yoga and who have achieved a lot of position or a stage or we can see a state of mind, which is of a very high quality. If it works out and if people who are at the helm of affairs, if they get this realization, then there's no problem. How do people find realization on your path? Is it by your presence, by this awakening, if you call it a line, I feel this cold wind here too indeed. Is it by your presence or what they say exercise, do they have to do some special exercise daily? No, no, no, no exercise nothing. You can open your hands. You just put your hands also, you will also feel it. So you see no exercise nothing. It's a living process. You see it is like you put the seed into the Mother Earth. It's proud, it's all built in, it's there. You are built in to be a divine computer, only you are to be connected, that's all. So this seed has to sprout. What do we do to the seed? No exercise, nothing. We just put it in the Mother Earth, it sprouts just like that. You don't have to do anything, just if you spread hands towards Me you get it. Afterwards they can do it, even from My photograph people have got real life. Photograph also has got vibration. They will show you some photographs where you can, they have, this camera they have got them because the vibrations have got what you call light in them. Mother Earth we have the book here if you want we can show you. Later on you can show him, okay. And also of Sastra you show him, that's the best part. No, let him see. But you see we don't show it normally to anyone because the trouble is you see people are only rationalizing everything. It's not rationalization, it is beyond that you see. So just that, that's all, you don't have to do anything. Yesterday on one song of Namadeva I gave realization to at least how many there were? 450 people. 450 people? And that to Germans you know. What means a lot indeed. Four things, you know they are so simple and so dedicated people that all people have really exploited them. Germans are the most exploited people. First Hitler exploited them. Now these false gurus are exploiting them. I hope somebody like Hitler should not come here again to exploit them. The church has exploited them. They are very dedicated, ideally the sign of simplicity. They are acidic temperament. They are acidic. And acidic poor things they are so intense that you can put them into anything. And we have quite interesting development in religion anyhow because in the last 150 years here in the West two things happened. What brought a kind of female consciousness to the people. First since 150 years we have apparitions of Virgin Mary all over Europe. Hundreds of it. With spiritual awakenings, with feelings of the Holy Spirit or Shachina and so on. Another hand we have a femaleization of the human consciousness. We have the women's liberation. We have equalization of the relationships, of the social position and so on. And yet in your age movement we see that many, many more and more spiritual teachers are women, are women. In the past to know if a good man, philosopher or a man. So we have a kind of female consciousness awakening. You see the female consciousness has awakened because of course I should say I am on the set after all. You see and I am a woman isn't it? So Shakti is very important. Shakti is very important. And in the concept of Christianity also when they say, Yes please go ahead. When they say that there is God the Father, God the Son and the Holy Ghost. How can you have Father and Son and not the Mother? It's quite a gay company. I mean absurd. But second that the Holy Spirit was female originally in the Jewish tradition and Greek. Of course, of course. Sophia and Greek. The Holy Spirit has to be. The Holy Spirit has to be let to go back. What's the matter with you? Nothing. Sleepy or? No, no. So Holy Spirit has to be able. If you do not have this concept then how to break their heads you see. The concept itself is very dominant. And to Christ's Mother also they do not have much respect to be very frank. They call her a woman. How can woman have Christ as her child? And they do not believe in immaculate conception either. But we do. Indians do believe. They don't like all this talk. We do believe that there was immaculate conception. It's possible for God. Everything is possible. And if she was Mahalakshmi, if she was Radha, they described that Radha got a child. There's so many signs. Like Christ shows his fingers like this, you see. According to us this relates to Shri Krishna and this relates to Vishnu. So the Father shows. And if you read the book of the Goddess then you will understand in that it's clearly said that Christ was born in the same way as Christ was born. And that his father, he was crying for Father all the time. And his father said that you will be the support of the universe. Now you call him Christ. What is Christ? The word Christ comes from Krishna. What is Jesus? It's also the word comes from. The word in Hebrew is called as Yeshu. And Yeshu is the name of Yeshoda. And Radha must have thought of Yeshoda to give him the name. Because Yeshoda was the mother, faster mother of Shri Krishna. That's why it's called as Yeshu. It's so clear that and there they have talked about the Holy Ghost coming. They have talked but they are not looking out for it. And that Holy Ghost has to be the comforter. Means she has to give comfort. Means physical comfort. Mental comfort. Spiritual comfort. Then she has to give counsel. She is a counselor. That is what we call, first is the Mahakali Swaropa. Second one is Mahasara Sothi. Where she gives you, Mahakali is here within us. This is the Mahakali. This is Mahasara Sothi. So she gives us the counsel. Eda Pingala. Eda Pingala, yes. Eda stands for Mahakali. Pingala stands for Mahasara Sothi. Sushumna, the central path is the Mahalakshmi. And it is the only Mahalakshmi power because Vishnu is the only one who incarnates. She incarnates. And that's why she came as Sita, as Radha, as Fatima, as Christ Mother Mary. So for Sahaja Yoga, Mary is the goddess. She is Mahalakshmi. She is the one who is the Redeemer. So the first one is the Mahalakshmi who is the Comforter. Mahakali, this is Mahakali. And Mahasara Sothi is the counselor. And the central path of Mahalakshmi is the Redeemer. But through Vishnu Kundalini rises and gives a realization. The main topic of the next issue we do is indeed the reappearance of the goddess. What role will the goddess play in the new age? I think quite an important one. That's a very direct question. I think quite an important one. See, I must be something, isn't it, after all. But I've decided not to talk about myself. The reason is Christ was really the Son of God. He was Son of God, no doubt, because he was Shri Ganesha. But people crucified him when he said the truth. And so they're so stupid, you can see there, you see. So best thing is that let them get their realization and then normally that's much better. Because if I say something about myself, very few will accept who are not realisers, very few. So if you have reached that conclusion, that is the female power of Shakti, which is going to incarnate, you are just there. Let's see, what? Now they can give realization, no problem. He's got a cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. Top here. It's good, right? Very cool, yes. Very good, right? They didn't... It's really good. It's very good. Get some oil from my vanity case, because I'll have to oil his head. All right? Yes, in the hands also. The hands are too similar to the feet. Yes, yes, yes, yes, of course. This is the... Especially here. Good, good. But how I met you, see? Yes, yes. Is it? I even felt it when I gave you a hand and I thought, my God, it's quite cool. It's actually hot summer day. I know. It works very fast. Yesterday just I spoke for eight minutes at the most, at the most. They got their rhythm just too much. So as the more sahaja yogis are coming, it's spreading faster. I was surprised at Columbia. See, Columbia, they were about 3,500 or 800 people. Okay? And 800 came back. In Columbia, can you imagine? They have never seen my face before. But we need it. We need it in your consciousness. They need it, they want reality. They need it, no doubt. If we don't get it, our world will... Okay. You said it, you said it. You said it. That's what all spiritual teachers of the last century said. We need spiritual awakening for many, many people because if we don't get it... That's why we have to have sahaja yogis. We have to have sahaja yogis who know the job. Why don't you appear on TV? Why don't you appear on TV? I didn't follow. Why don't you appear on TV, on television? You know, I'll tell you about TV. 30 million people have been there. I would love, but you see, they, they, that's the trouble is. It's not available to me, it's available to people who pay money. But it's not. They don't accept. You know, I tell you, you won't believe and it's so funny that in England, you can write it down also, the BBC gentleman came to see me and what he says, that Anglo-Saxon brain. Are you Anglo-Saxon also? German sir? No, very good. Very much. They come from Germany. Yeah. When the Saxon people came from Northern Germany. Oh, I see. But we are Saxon and they are Anglo-Saxon. Oh, I see. So the Anglo-Saxon brain. Anglo-Saxon. Oh, they are Anglo-Saxon. Anglo-Saxon. Anglo-People came from Northern Germany too. Let's be Anglo-Saxon. Oh, no. Whatever it is, it's all made by God, the brain. What he told me very precisely, that Anglo-Saxon brain, you cannot understand that you can get anything in this world without money. So I asked him, how much money will you pay me? How much did you pay to Christ? The most surprising thing is that they call themselves Christians. I have got connections to Germany too, not to be received. But if you come the next time, I can arrange for it. Of course, I would be very happy. Okay, no problem. I would be very happy and I have blast all of these falsehoods. I have many friends too and they have multi-business and table business. That's very good. And you know, America has accepted us as a religion. But Germany is the most difficult country because they say we are a cult. How are we a cult? We don't have any money, business, nothing of the kind. So how are we a cult? But why? Because they are afraid of reality. Everybody is afraid of reality. Yeah, you know, we have quite a strong protest in church and it is getting more and more empty, you know, they have to sell the churches as discotheques like I have been in Berlin. It's a matter of fact, I'm not joking. And there is some, you know, witch hunter, a modern age witch hunter called Farahak. Who is he? Farahak. He is exactly the man we have been to Farahak. Because Farahak, he is talking about you. The gentleman? He calls us as cult. Right one. Really? Yeah, why? Because nobody goes to the protestant church anymore. We have to do it. It's a mighty congruence, you know. No, but you see, that is true that there are false gurus, no doubt. You must cancel on three points. First point is anybody who takes money for giving any awakening or any spiritual thing then cancel it out of one. Second, you must see the disciples. What is the achievement of disciples? How are they? Are they knowledgeable? Now he spoke yesterday for two years, two hours on Sahaja Yoga. I didn't have to talk. Now Philip Enjy will come to Sahaja Yoga. Actually Nepali got it. Two years ago was the magic. Just imagine, two years he's grown so much. So what have they achieved? Then also you must find out what sort of lifestyle the Guru has, you see. If he drinks and if he does all kinds of dirty things and then calls himself a Guru, what sort of a Guru is he? Of course, I mean now supposedly I come from a family, my husband is such and such, you know what his position is in life. So I have to dress up according to that. That's a different point. But I don't take money from them for my day to day life. So this is what is to be found out. How is he living? What is lifestyle? He says one thing does another thing. This Mahesh Yogi is another horrible fellow. You have got it. He's again getting strong. He has put so many people out of their houses, their soul, their houses. We had a group of people who came to Me. One of them was the one who was running his flying foundation in Scotland. I'll send you his letters if you want to publish that. And the people who got aids who came to Me, most of them were from this TM. I don't know what he does. They get cancers, they get heart attacks, this, that. See, I, as a mother I say, if you have got a Guru, at least your health should be all right. As a mother. So you have to become your own Guru to understand this. And then you have to have more people who can give Realization. They all can give Realization. All of them can give to 1000 people. But you know they are not like these Gurus who have nothing in them and they have put up their organizations. I tell them you go and talk about it loudly. That's something you age is teaching too, okay? Everybody has to become his own Guru. You can get a blessing but some of the others. Of course you have to. That's what? But in the end effect you have to get self, okay? Not only you know, so let's say, what happened? What's in the right list of times? Okay, I have to believe that. And no, but... You should not blindly believe anything. Yes, yes, yes. And you believe. It's the same if I believe in the church or if I believe in the... experience. You see now with these vibrations you can find out everything because you become competent. You can feel it, yes, you can feel it. And relax too much. Now just see your foot also may be all right. Just put it up. Better now? Yes, it's better. It was much thicker. Yes? This hole is much less. Yes, yes, yes. Now just put it up like this, the one you have put it up like this. Get some eyes, see, and with the foot is put in the eyes of God. The right side is put left to the right. You think too much, you used to think. Now you won't be able to think too much. You will think when you want to think. Not all the time. Because it's quite a worrying thing, you know. One gets very much worried. So many seekers are lost, so many. Even those who were taking drugs were nothing but seekers, you know, seekers of truth. Now we have so many people who took drugs, finished now. Everybody is searching, yes, everybody. Every human being is searching for something, okay? And some people give up. And some people say, okay, I can't find God, I try to find money. And things like that, but... That's my lecture, you see. Everybody is looking for something. You give him the unique discovery he has, you see. Is he in it? Yes, yes. Is there any unique discovery? We'll give you lots of things in this. Lots of things? Please give me more material because the press can't... I will give you this, too. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. You can see we have lots of it, we have got lots of it. And we've got lots of people who have been cured of incurable diseases, the certificates of doctors, everything we have. And we have seven doctors now in London who have started recording all these things, how many people have been cured. Automatically. All incurable diseases. Blood cancer we have to. I think the Soviet Union will be very interested because every people in the Soviet Union and Russia, because... Because they don't have a church in the background, okay, and they believe in experience and they believe in... but it's real happening and it's also healing, they really believe because breast cancer... Oh, you see the Health Minister invited one of the Sahaja Yogis. From India. He's gone to see him and they were about to call Rajnish. Luckily there's chance would have it. This one of the Sahaja Yogis met the ambassador or someone and that's how it is being now postponed. But I'm going there and some doctors are also going for health purposes. Let's see. Is it good for you? Yeah, that's good. Put left, left to the right. Alright. Alright, just see. It's cooled off. Now better? Yeah, much better. Of course, much less. Just a minute. Just a minute. This ice can suffer. No, I was in the wheelchair for four weeks and hospital for weeks, wheelchair for weeks and... I wish you had met me earlier. ...on sticks and now I can finally walk. Yeah, and you see that everything, time has to come. That's the point. Time has to come. Look at today. I said that I must go and see the face of the lady, how they have put her up. So I went the other way to see her. Yeah, yeah. When I meet you. Yeah, yeah. How you recognized me is remarkable. Yeah, I know your face. I was on your lecture three years ago in Frankfurt. But you didn't come. And on the book fair about India where you didn't come. And so of course I know your face. But Frankfurt are from Munich. At that time I lived in Göttingen. Now I moved first to St. Berg and in April to Munich. Now I live in Munich. We live in Munich. But in Frankfurt was the book fair. At that time the main topic was India. And I was at the Frankfurt book fair. And you were very good at the paper also in Munich. It's the same paper. If I move it moves because it belongs to you. I belong to you. So that's why. Is it a newspaper or is it the magazine? The magazine belongs to him Simat. He is, he is the, he produces the magazine. I am the publisher. He is the publisher. So if I move it. You see also Mohammad Sahab has said. You see. Mohammad Sahab has said at the time of resurrection. He calls it the time of resurrection which you call as new age. Your hands will speak. And they'll give you witness against you. They'll tell you what are the centers that are in the magazine. Can you believe it? And he's described so much about the resurrection. And he said all this namaz and all this you have to do till you get your realization. When you get your realization and when you know yourself at the time of resurrection you don't have to do anything. But Muslims wear our clothes. But we have hit them in Turkey. And now we are going to go to Tunisia and what other place? Algeria, Tunisia and what other you said? Senegal, you said Senegal. He was telling me that like a morocco, morocco. He was telling me morocco. Because this barrister was saying that you can. I was going to Turkey they all said mother you see this. I said nothing, I am going. What's going to happen to me? Let's see and it worked. And Muslims have very good search points. It has now done. What's that? Things too much still. I'll make you absolutely alright because the mother must look after the child. I think so much better. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, very much better. But you saw the P in German TV. You saw the K in German TV. You saw the K in German television. You should have P on the television. That would be very nice. Maybe next year we can arrange something because he has a lot of good connections to the German TV. We agree. We can arrange something. Some friends of mine are movie makers and have studios and whatever. And we organize a conference now in October and be an all-MAYER TV shows in Germany. Give them all realisation first. Call your friends you see. How can I do it? You can of course and they will help you. You can now just buy this. They will teach you to help. You see you can do it. What's your name you say? Michael. Michael. You can do it. Michael is Bhairava. In fact. Just a minute. Now come along. I'll just put the, just come. I'll turn your agya because it's too much thing has done being done. She's been worried I think. She's coming. She's a seeker out and out of a level. No, no. Put him left to the right first. That's better. Done. That's it. Lot of heat coming up. Better now? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Very good. Excellent. Great soul right? His whole potential is coming. But he has met all these horrible people also. He has to. You too his works mother. That's very good. Ah, may God bless you. Now let's see his foot also. He's much better. He's left out. Get a band. Now let's, because left now he could be because of his hectic life. Let it be. Let it be. Let it be. Then here. That's because maybe you'll be hectic life. Ha, now. All right? It's clear now. Yes, both. Now you're feeling all right? Yeah. Relaxed? No thought. Ah, very good. Very sadist, I'm saying. That's because of these horrible gurus he has been to. Put him in the swadhisthana. He's too many seeds. It's very hot, you know. Very hot. Now better? You can turn down and put my foot in here. Now better see now your foot. Hello, my son? Yes, absolutely. Oh yeah, oh yeah. You see? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Much better now. Yeah. You can see the train. You can see the river. I'm not turned off. Can you take off your shoes? Can you take off your shoes? Can you take off your shoes? You see these gurus who we have met, they have trouble. That's why you got an accident. Can you come on the back side? No, no, no. Now you teach him how to give realization, fully, so that he can give realization to people. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Don't feel guilty. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Don't feel guilty. It's here. Put your hand. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, just that. Hmm. Hmm. No, you are, you have entered into the Kingdom of God, and after all, what mistakes you have committed? Nothing. Put your both the hands on the Mother Earth. Let's see. Yes. Very relaxed. Completely relaxed. All left to Shirdi. Hmm. Hmm. Don't feel guilty. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Don't listen to them, and they tell you you are guilty. Malak and Shirdi. Hmm. Hmm. And maybe, let us take out the mala, let us see. Maybe, you see, this is Tulsi's mala. No, no, no. It's all right, but maybe the catch is sometimes, you see, material things do catch. Let's see. And your hand, can we take out from your hand also a little bit your material? Yeah. Whatever, nice. Just a little bit. I declare him by the jug. Yeah. But the dress you can keep yourself. I will wear it. You are all right. Yeah, you are all right. Now, just see. Now better. It's clear. It's clear, absolutely clear. Wish you this clear? Not yet. It's very hectic life, yes. That's right. What? Very hectic, eh? Oh, yes. That's it. No rhythm in the life. But these new age people have to be genuine and honest and should be intelligent. You see, you must seek intelligently. Like a blind faith, if you think about it, you will be another sect like Christianity or Hindus or this and that nonsense, you see. But if you really want the reality, then you have to be intelligent to see things. Is it divine intelligence? No, but... Hmm? No. You shouldn't say it when I am doing something. You are supposed to. You can take after it. You see, now. Now, what do you say? That's clear. Now, right? They are all pink gold, are you? Tell me. No. She is there. She is the problem. You have to tell me. You have to. It's the best. You should feel guilty, you see, for small, small things. That I should reach late, if this happens, that happens. You know these Western ideas. You are a free bird. All right, if you want to reach in, reach in time or you will reach. All right. Nothing to feel guilty. All right, aren't you? That is it. These are perfectionists, you know? No. You are not. You are not. You are not. You are not. You are not. You are not. You are not. You are not. You are not. You are not. You are not. You are not. Maybe in the experience, you might have been, you see the spinal cord, you should jam yourself. So it doesn't work in the relationship. Hmm. Good. This picture I have, I think this one is, that's a bit, should be, right. You lose, lose, lose. Everyone has to work. I am kind of a practic. Everything. You have to massage, you have to do this, you have to do that. This Guru nicely sits down, you know, take the money. Come on, for cooking some sort of a mess, for isn't it pure? It's much better. Once the issue opens out, it starts moving faster. Now, the mother has to also anoint your head with a coil, you don't mind. Oh, she wants to see. Immediately cools down, immediately. You are all feeling the cooling? Yes. The collective conscious. Very good. Still his left abdomen is quite a lot, I must say. Left abdomen is quite a lot. You are married, Fainter? No. Then you just say, Mother, I am married, that's all. That's a mantra. Mother, I am married, say that. Just, just, just. Mother, I will marry. Yes, that's all. Just say this one more. If you marry to a girl, yes, she will marry to a girl. We will get you a very good marriage. Mother, I will marry. Mother, I will marry. Mother, I will marry. Mother, I will marry. Sooner or later. Sooner or later. Get you. Now, now, you see, that's a normal life. You want to marry me? No, no. You see, once you are married, you get into a balance, you see. And marriage is a divine thing. It starts of it's stupid. That's what it has happened. The best that people don't understand. But now, every year, perhaps, we have 75 international marriages. And most of them are successful. Most of them, I would say. Now, now the love is settling down, huh? You see, asceticism can make you very true. Acetics are not normal. You have to touch them with a barge pole. Now, just... His face is so relaxed. Right? Still, you get up here, up side. What's wrong, Mother? What? I think we should use the centre part, Mother. Centre, heart, huh? Should we see? We should do it, huh? Heart, Mother. Alright, I will just do it. Now, hold your breath. I am going to hold you. Now, through it out, Father. Again. Through it out. Once more. Through it out. So much, huh? We should always say, always happens. With the higher chakras, remember, because that's all. With the higher chakras, when there is obstruction, the lower chakras show the results. You see, because they can't, you see, the energy cannot flow properly. That's why. So always clear the higher chakras. Just this thing. Now it's flowing, Mother. How are you feeling, Michael? I am feeling good. Quite relaxed. What do you mean? Now you make him an expert of certain. Yes. Jhans. See, with the practice, we clear out. But it's very clear now, very clear. You're focused on that sometimes. Ah, now. Still. You see, he vibrated on his head. So he can put it before his bath, and he put it, and he washes it. You are right for him. It's hot. Very peaceful now. How are you feeling? Hello, hello, hello, hello. Here, we are in England. Hello. May God bless you. So, how are you? Fine, Shri Mataji, thank you. Sorry for last minute instructions. That's all right, Shri Mataji, no problem. You see, she was going to talk to me. No, what happened? Do you have to give him a bottle? Just for vibrating, Shri Mataji, and we put it in a bottle. You see, a gentleman will be amazed at such part of it. Maybe he had gone as usual for a little bit shopping and to go around the market. And there's a very beautiful statue of the Mother Goddess, of Maharaj. And you could see only the backside. So he said, all right, I'll bring the car. I said, all right, I'll go around and see the face also and of the child. It's beautiful statue. Now with four ganas, are carrying four raksas. Beautiful, very simple. So when there is this gentleman was sitting there, and he is the owner of a magazine which is dealing with all spiritual matters. And next issue he is going to have on the advent of a Goddess, and the primordial Mother. Can you believe it? Shri Mataji is just in the beginning. He just said, what's happening is, it's a matter of fact. It's a matter of fact. What's happening is, I can't believe it on my face. And he just said, advise me, you see. He just said, advise my face. And then we called him. He's a very wise man. They have stunned, you know. English has stunned, but this can happen only to Germans, I think. Just think of it. Everything is possible these days, yeah. These are Jews, you know. They now respect Christ and anybody can respect. I have 25% of the insurance too. It's a matter of fact. What has happened? We are coming with the musician's Shri Mataji. So are you going now? No, no, no. I'll be requested tomorrow morning. Yes, he's all right. What is the hurry? No, there's no problem. We just came to leave the instruments here so that we can take them tomorrow morning. We can have some music? Very good, Shri Mataji. It's a such. It's such. It's such filing this last month. Yes, very good. I was thinking of requesting you Shri Mataji when you could have some music. Yeah, yeah. Yes, now. You bought something? These are all the instruments. You didn't buy anything? I said, I went to the instrument store. Yes. I didn't get anything. I had to give orders. I had to go for 4-5 days. Okay. You gave them, you took them. I took them. You gave them orders? Yes. You see, he wants to buy some strings from here. He's a Japanese. Yes. But he says they have to have orders. Even orders. Now let him order. Yes, we can send it. The only thing they need is a sample of the strings that they need. And then they can do exactly the same. No, no, but he says he can. Yes, yes. I got a sample like that. What is that? Is that a sample you gave them? Yes. Ah, you're carrying it. Yes. So we're in get-ness. Yes. Absolutely relaxed. Absolutely open. In the central of the market space, there was a very beautiful statue of the mother and the child. You can sit there. Sit. Sit. Is the nescail hot? Yes, it is. Is your nose hot? Yes, it is. It is hot here. Now it is hot. He said, let it be hot. Yes, it is. We will leave it here. You say, let it be hot. It is hot. Yes, it is. Sit. What should we see? I will actually sit down. Yes, we have to close the door. Otherwise the neighbors will see us. I am so sorry Simad. The neighbors will see us. What's the time? 10 or 15? Oh God! No problem if we have some instrumental music Simad, there is no problem. Not too loud. I am so sorry. I have to put my head down. Hahaha! You can put your head down. I will put my head down. You can put my head down. Yes, sit. Before taking your bath, you have to take your feet as well as your hands. Before taking your bath, before the bath, you have to take your hands off. Here I am. What? One. One. One. I think now it is alright. Is it alright? Yes, it is. It is alright. It is alright. It is alright. It is alright. It is alright. It is alright. Stay here. No question. Stay here. Stay here. Have you eaten yet? No. You have not eaten before? I have eaten in the office. You haven't eaten at all? No. You have eaten? I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Can you leave it there? Sure. We'll keep in touch. We'll give you the blue page. Unfortunately, we didn't have it. We had a pre-order and two programs yesterday. Public program. I'll leave it there. It's the big report. It's where it is. We're making it in the Artistic House. We're making it in the middle of the room. We're making it in the big, in the seven stages. And who will be part of it? Who is not informed? I'll give you the lecture and you'll do it where you talked about it earlier. You can also say that you're not informed. You can also say that you're not informed. You can also say that you're not informed. Because many of you have learned English and I know that I know that you've been asked who will be part of it. And who will be part of it? I'll give you the lecture and you'll do it where you talked about it earlier. Yes. Yes. I'm sorry. Then I stop this, there are seven of them. Everybody turn here. Then I stop. Then yeah. You see, this is Vince Dawkins, this is Ken Gaster. This is the knowledge. This is the knowledge. Seven of them. This is the knowledge. Not the one. This is my house. I'm not happy. I'm not sure if you're not sure about your house. What does he say about your house? He says it's only very bad. I'm thinking somebody is hiding somewhere. Oh yeah. Okay. Of course, you know, I'm like a guy. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Yeah. Yes. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. This is why we don't become people who are interested in this. This is how long time ago. We have not decided. We thought we would be left like this. Also, the results of the research we have, you see, these are the different kind of knowledge. I think that the energy powers come out of this. I should see the one who is holding it. And you can see it. See all the power is connected. That's right. And here is the question. I'm sitting here. You are all the same. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. No, it's definitely not your presence. By law they would just come. They could call the polis. And the polis would come here and they would say... They would say a terrible decision. And it would be good. So we started with the kamal. I'm not sure.

I don't know what, how to say, uh.. as to the Russian scholars and scientists. Scientists are amoral people. Because science is amoral. But I was surprised that in Jeddi dutt, chemistry professor, we had about two thousand scientists, I don't know, ten thousand of them, who honored Me so much. And I told about one center of the world, that is Swadisthana. How Swadisthana can do it your life. And they were listening to Me absolutely with a lot of attention. But it's very surprising that they have never seen such scientists. Because they cannot see something beyond science. And Sahaja Yoga is mega science. It is beyond science. And when I told them how so many diseases are caused by one center, they were really amazed at it. But they were open, open minded people and a scientist means an open minded person. They were amazed also at the way they gave the awards. The first award that they gave Me, I said what it is, I am the tenth member of such an old university where very very great scientists have got the Sahaja Yoga. So how can you give me such a honor? So professor well now told Me, that, Mother, these scientists have only worked with matter. But You have worked with human beings and transformed. I was surprised the way he saw the point in this country. Easy to see this point that transformation of human beings is most important to me. If I have achieved it, it's nothing great I think because I knew how to do it, so it's nothing great. But I really feel very proud of you that you have achieved it. I have not achieved it. I was born with it. But you have achieved it. So many nations here simply enjoy the same beautiful feeling of your Spirit. And there are some different nations, different races, different religions and generally they are feeling the joy of their Spirit. And this is something which was My dream and vision but I never thought of Nobel Prize or anything like that. Because My husband has got all kinds of prizes and he always is all due to My wife. But what I really treasure is, that in a great country like Russia where science has reached its heights, that they should accept Me as a great scientist and academician. It's something very, very remarkable. Though I don't know if I deserve it or not. But that's what I feel about it. There is no doubt about it. Moreover, all the false rules are banned in Russia. But I was surprised also that they did not ban us. Apart from that, the patriarch who is like the Pope of Enninga, of the white horse, he himself invited Me to be there. So we are entering into the realm of religion also. It's something not only science but also religion which has to open eyes and see what have they missed or the promises that the prophets gave, that the incarnations gave are to be fulfilled. If they can just see this point, it will be so great. I was surprised also that the patriarch himself invited Me to this conference. So two great things I feel, that not only in science but also in religion, Sahaja Yoges is entering and will remove the darkness of ignorance. Another thing I must tell you that when I went to Brasilia, which is the capital of Brasilia, the mayor of Brasilia came to the city and he gave me the peace of Brasilia, saying, on the peace you can't go to Brasilia. I was seeing it again. So on the political side also if you start entering into our problems you should have no problems, you should have no quarrels, no fights, nothing so. But let us live with happiness and love. I am sure, if this, I can see that vision coming through, this vision of mind, of seeing the whole world in peace and joy, enjoy themselves. All of you as he said, has had to judge Me, have to come up to Me and really do something to You. I don't know, sir, how to thank you very much because I don't know what's, but he has been needing Me for three, four years now. I was surprised, he is such a judgment man, such a educated person, and how he could see from the subtle side of life and that they discussed about morality, all the time all the subjects were that had morality. There was a gentleman who was a surgeon who is, how did you say, dearest, that's such a person. Very old, but he is still doing operations, he is still doing operations. And he is the one who wrote the Darshan of God. And I was a research guy. He wrote a book against Darshan of God in a country where both God is so popular. But just imagine, and these people listen to their letters. They are not like Western people who do not care for their letters. They listen to their letters who are very wise. One day I'm sure Russia will be one of the most important religious country. It will have such big name on it because they have taken to truth and not to nonsensical things. And I'm sure this will prove the good word that truth is what we should ask for. We should not get in any way dominated by untruth because untruth will never bring joy or peace. Actually I'm overwhelmed by what he has said and I'm happy he has made me so happy also by saying these beautiful things about me. But I must tell you, I'm a very humble housewife. That's all I am. I'm more than that. I'm not going to challenge you. Now we have to thank the Turkish people, the French people for organizing this beautiful program and this wedding despite all the problems and also everything works so hard because there were only 40 Sahaja Yogis in Turkey and they have done such dedicated work and so capable they are. I'm amazed to see this kind of industrious I should say or maybe hard of me. They have to be. And all the problems are solved here. They say, Mother, you have solved all the problems. Now I would say the managers have been done very patiently. Now don't spoil your managers and create problems already. That's all I want to know that you have very nice children and that you lead a society and help the society of great peacemakers. Thank you very much.

May God bless you all. I mean, I never expected so many people will be there, but I'm very happy for all these marriages and so many of the girls who are willing to marry. Sahaja Yoga has a special responsibility. If you are marrying in Sahaja Yoga, then you must understand one thing, that before marriage you can decide whether you want to marry or not, once for all. After marriage, if you start misbehaving, you're doing anything wrong, then we are not responsible. And after that we can answer you from marriage list. Then very difficult to get you married again. So first of all for Ganesha's blessings you should be good people. In Sahaja Yoga everybody cannot get married. All kinds of stupid ideas, hard to be given up. If you are good character, well behaved, loving person, then you marry in Sahaja Yoga. And you have to have love for your wife, maximum for your wife, nothing else. You have to trust her, you have to love her, and you have to give her everything that you can afford. First of all you must establish very good relationships with them. Sahaja Yoga marriage is not easy. They are all there to support you, to help you, to give you all the blessings. But in case you are not capable, you are very ordinary, very troublesome, then their marriages will fizzle out and then you go out of Sahaja Yoga. So even there is chance now to decide whether you want to marry or not. If you have decided to marry, be determined, you have promised that you will remain very good husbands and you will look after your wife, your family, and ultimately Sahaja Yoga. This is a special occasion for you and for us. It's not like any other marriage. So I would say that whatever has been decided about you, please accept it fully, with full endorsement. So far in Sahaja Yoga very few marriages are made, very, very few. And those who have broken are shattered, completely shattered. So we have to establish in Sahaja Yoga very good family life, very nice husbands, not like any other stupid that they are going round. No. We are a very unique personalities and we have a very unique relationships. So I request you all to be sure on that point, that you will show that your marriages are not like other marriages, very different. And you have to work it out in such a manner that they become ideal marriages. I hope you have achieved the promise. Thank you very much.

That's right. And I think we should close the door because all the mosquitos are coming. Really? Thank you. Come forward and say, All right. Mosquitos won't come in. Why don't you do something?

Each of them, for one. Open it. If you put off the lights, just now for one minute all of them will go out. You put off the lights, you see, you have to deceive them a little bit. Now you have to pull down the blinds, you can't just leave it open. Put off all the lights, all the lights. One minute put off all the lights, you see. I'll tell you what. Yes. And then open the window. Open the door, see, open the door please. So these will go away. These lights, yes, put off. Now see, they'll go out. Open the doors. Open the door fully. They'll go away. See, they are clinging on to light. It's a kind of darkness sometimes. It's nice to be in darkness sometimes. Yes, if we would like it so much, we wouldn't call for you. Yes, but... It's a spanty much, you know. That's all right. As long as you have it low. Now put them down on the ground. Please close it, don't hand it that way. It'll be bigger. Yes, it's good. Karen? Yes. Now put down all the blinds, so that they don't come. They are ready. They are ready. One minute, Harjai. Now put down the blinds. And the mosquitoes will go out. And then you go. See, you sit in it for so long, it'll get suffocated. It's all right. Now who has gone out there? They should come back. Why are they going out, these ladies? They are going out, these ladies. They should call the women in. Should we close it? Yes. Call them in and close the door, and then they'll come inside. You know, for one minute, don't put on any light, just a little bit.

Our Mother the Earth, a presentation of American Indian prose and poetry on the occasion of Devi Pooja. Laudheyamma Deva. You're going to do it this one? This is the one you're doing? Yes. Oh, I see. I didn't know. I'm sorry. All right, let's start. Shri Mataji, dearest Mother. On the eve of Devi Pooja, we, the Sahaja Yogis of North America, gather in the town of Bantam, Connecticut. The word Bantam means place of prayer in an American Indian language. In this place of prayer, we like to present a reading of words by and about the American Indians. These poems and statements express these native peoples' desire to live simply and peacefully on the Earth. Their respect and love for nature, for you, Mother, and all your aspects in this beautiful land of Shri Krishna. We respectfully offer this presentation to you, Mother, to bring this great people and their philosophy into your divine attention. Shri Mataji, dearest Mother. On the eve of Devi Pooja, we welcome our beloved Mother, the Sahaja Yogis of North America. Shri Mataji, dearest Mother. On the eve of Devi Pooja, we welcome our beloved Mother, the Sahaja Yogis of North America. Shri Mataji, dearest Mother. Life-renewing dawn is born. The birth of dawn from sun and darkness is a mystery very sacred, though it happens every day. Pleasant is looked, this newly created world. All along the length and breadth of the Earth, our grandmother spread the green reflection of her covering, and the escaping fragrance was pleasant to inhale. The great spirit, when he made the Earth, made no lines of division or separation on it. He meant that it should be allowed to remain as made. The Earth was Mother. I was made of the Earth and grew up on its bosom. The Earth, my Mother and Nurse, is sacred to my affections, too sacred to be valued by gold or sold for silver. The Indian believes profoundly in silence, the sign of a perfect equilibrium. Silence is the absolute poise or balance of mind, mind and spirit. The man who preserves his selfhood is ever calm and unshaken by the storms of existence. Not a leaf as it were, a stir on the tree, not a ripple upon the surface of the shining pool. His, in the mind of the unlettered sage, is the ideal attitude and conduct of life. If you ask what is silence, he will answer, it is a great mystery. The holy silence is his voice. If you ask what are the fruits of silence, he will say, they are self-control, true courage or endurance, patience, dignity and reverence. Silence is the cornerstone of character. The man who sat on the ground in his teepee, thinking of life and its meaning, accepting the kinship of all creatures and knowing unity with all things, was drawing into his being the true heart of civilization. The Indian was a true naturalist, a lover of nature. He loved the earth and all things of the earth, the attachment growing with age. The old people came literally to love the soil and they sat or reclined on the ground with a feeling of being close to a mothering power. It was good for the skin to touch the earth and the old people liked to remove their moccasins and walk with bare feet on the sacred earth. Their teepees were built upon the earth and their altars were made of earth. The birds that flew in the air came to rest upon the earth and it was a final abiding place of all things that lived and grew. The soil was soothing, strengthening, cleansing and healing. O our mother the earth, O our father the sky, your children are we. With joyful hearts we bring you the gifts you love. So we for us a garment of brightness. May the warp be the white light of morning, may the weft be the red light of evening, may the fringes be the falling rain, may the border be the standing rainbow. We for us this bright garment that we may walk where birds sing, where the grass is green, O our mother the earth, O our father the sky. The ancient Hopi Indians. The Hopi Indians still tell stories of the ancient migration of 10,000 years throughout the American Southwest in the shape of a swastika. This shape gave religious meaning to the journey as the Hopi were aware of the swastika as an auspicious symbol. The Arizona, New Mexico area where they journeyed remained a special place where the silence and the purity of mother and her nature can be especially felt. The Hopi stories tell of the crown of the head as a center through which every breath moves up and down with a gentle vibration that communicates with the creator. Aware of vibratory centers along the spine they sense the echoing primordial sound of life or heard a warning when anything was wrong. In the last phase of their creation myth the soft spot hardened and this special door was closed to them. They predict and expect a new world where all peoples are blessed with the renewal of a deeper relationship with God by way of the reopening of this special door which we know as the Sastra Chakra. If there is a name, a word, that can show the world what Hopi piece is, it is balance. The world must grow and expand but it must do it in balance. What is seen, touched and felt is thought to be real rather than the reflection of the world of the unseen, the real dimension of creation. When prayer and meditation are used rather than relying on new inventions to create more imbalances, we will find the true path. The Iroquois Confederacy In the eastern part of the continent lived the Iroquois people whose territory extended from New York State to Ohio. This area of Bantam was previously Iroquois land. In ancient times a war-like people with nations fighting against nations, the Iroquois were able to rise above their history of war to unite in a unique inter-tribal government known as the Five Nations Confederacy. At the heart of the Confederacy was its constitution which, according to legend, was given to the Iroquois by a man known as Degudoida. His coming had been announced to his grandmother in a dream. In this dream a messenger from the great creator told her that her daughter, a virgin, would bear a son who would bring peace and life to the people on earth. The child was called Degudoida. When Degudoida was grown he spread his mission of truth to the Five Nations. I carry the mind of the master of life, he said, and my message will bring an end to wars between East and West. The word that I bring is that all people shall love one another and live together in peace. Degudoida According to legend, the first person to take hold of Degudoida's message was a woman. For women were to hold in store the chieftainship titles and name the chiefs of the Confederacy. Their role was to be the sustainers, those who worked behind the scenes, those whose influence was powerful but indirect. Around the council fires of the league the men spoke their voices clear in the forest. But the women were always there, quiet in the background, and the men knew that they were watching, maintaining the balance. The Constitution given by Degudoida was a sophisticated statement of government. The Albany Plan of Union, an early attempt to unify the American colonies devised by Benjamin Franklin, was similar to and inspired by the Iroquois Constitution. Thomas Jefferson as well studied the Iroquois Constitution when drafting the present American Constitution. The piece of the Iroquois was symbolized by a great tree with roots stretching out to the four directions. It is reminiscent of the Tree of Life and of the four petals of the Muldadar chakra. I am Degudoida, and with the chiefs of the five nations I plant the Tree of the Great Peace. Roots have spread out from the Tree of the Great Peace. The name of these roots is the Great White Roots, and their nature is peace and strength. Any man of my nation, any man of any nation, may trace the roots to their source and be welcome to shelter beneath the Great Peace. We place at the top of the Tree of the Great Peace an eagle who is able to see afar. If he sees in the distance any evil approaching for any danger threatening, he will at once mourn the people of the Confederacy. I, Degudoida, and the chiefs of our five nations of the Great Peace, we now uproot the tallest pine into the cavity thereby made we cast all weapons of war, into the depths of the earth, into the deep underneath we cast all weapons of war. We bury them from sight forever, and we plant again the Tree. Thus shall the Great Peace be established. We bind ourselves together by taking hold of each other's hands. Our strength shall be in union, our way the way of reason, righteousness, and peace. Harkon, O chiefs, that peace may continue onto future days. Have courage. Think not so much of present advantage as the future welfare of the people. Be of strong mind, O chiefs. Carry no anger. Neither anger nor fear shall find lodging in your mind, and all your words and actions shall be tempered with calm deliberation. Think not forever of yourselves, nor of your own generation. Think of the unborn of the future nation. We return thanks to our mother, the earth, who sustains us, to the rivers and streams that run upon the bosom of the earth, to the three sisters, corn, beans, and squash that support our lives, to the winds that move the air, banishing disease, to the descending rains that give us water and cause all plants to grow, to the moon and stars that give us water and to the stars that give us light when the sun is gone. We return thanks to the sun who looks upon the earth with a fatherly eye. I'll say something about it now. I have also now found out that in Africa, ancient times, there are people who believed in Kundalini and they believed in subtle centers within us, just like these people here in America. And they always said that, awakening of this Kundalini, we are not going to change our realization. But of course they didn't use the word Kundalini, but they have shown in pictures and different kinds of cave paintings. I'm going to find out all about it and I hope you'll be able to publish it somewhere. So the tendency of today's generation is to go back to past, to find out what was there in the past and where are we. It's nice to do that way because then you can know how far we have come, how far we have deviated and how far we have to go. Now with all these ideas, which look so primitive to modern people, one has to know that from that primitiveness, if there were no aggression, if these people had lived for today, they would have definitely been much better people for Sahaja Yoga because their attention was towards eternal and not towards transitory things. Why? Now the modern times is such that our attention has now gone to transitory things and we are not bothered about eternal life and that attention has moved so far away that say from primitive life you come to the center and then you just forget about the center and move forward and they find it so difficult to come back because they have moved so much ahead of reality that it is for them a going down or sort of a giving up something which they think they have found something great and so still they are moving towards their destruction. Then the Sahaja Yogis also feel very upset about it but you can see that in this country there are people who have said those things, they have left their vibrations, it has been so here so that exist vibrations cannot disappear. They are there and once they are awakened again we are sure we can work out wonders in this country also. The only problem is they are so mainly proud of their advancement that they don't see their advancing towards their destruction and for this people have to write openly saying that what we are thinking about advancement is nothing but is our complete destruction and that's what we are facing. Tomorrow I am going to tell you as to what Sahaja Yogis have to do for that in America. There is a special thing one has to do in America because now as you see that the country is not of that level as we think it to be and to spread spiritual life you all have to do something about it and I'll talk about it tomorrow before the quarter. Thank you. Can you put off the... it's much better now. So what are they doing? She's doing much better than she is. Ah, so what are they doing? How big they have grown, eh? Oh, he's grown so big. Hmm? Sahaja Yogis are? Tomorrow puja after puja, chocolate after puja. They won't melt away. Tomorrow they'll have to eat a lot. I'll go and talk to you. Should we give chocolates just now to children? All right. Because tomorrow there will be lots of things for children. We have a children. In the Shri Mataji's room. In the yellow bag. Hello. He'll go with the chocolate. He'll go with the chocolate. Only for the children? Only for the children? Only the sweets. No, there's a toddler on inside. He's coming. You're sending somebody? He's going to go himself. That's also flimsy. This is primitive. What is he doing? Up the hallway. The children love to dance, mother. All right. There should be flute music with this, but perhaps there's not. I don't know. I'm not sure it's got enough volume. And perhaps this is of the new generation now, Shri Mataji. This is a poem about the collective and the miracle of the children's realization of you and your gift to them. They've done this in public. They're a group that's called from the heart. Life beats. Within me, awakening. New form. Arms reaching out like wings. I am lifted. Held. Then I stand independently. I gaze upon it all. Balancing. Amusement. Am. I am happy. When I totter, flutter, turn. Am. I am we, and I am free. Am. Life greets. Another me as I grow. Bigger. Longer and funnier. With and without teeth. And I feel. I ponder. And I wonder, how am I going to learn how? Teacher. Teacher. Please give me the skills to become all that I want to be. Show me the important things I need to know to reach out. To touch. To stretch. To hold on. To let go. Enrich me with wonderment and curiosity. For I am young. I am male energy. Surging. Leaping. Expanding. Extending. Muscles strength and spirits gentle power. Life force channel to express creative joy. What I know and embody is real sanity. I respect all life and I know my sisters. I know their bounty and their beauty. As life repeats itself. As life repeats. Her pleasure. Her pleasure. Her pleasure. Mother earth, my teacher. Mother moon, my guide. Mother ship, our vessel. Mother land wherever I choose to abide. And in her pleasure I serve her. And from her treasure my needs are met. Respecting the life I am given. I reflect her special gift. For I am a child of the universe. Mother earth. Mother earth. Watching. Listening. Together. Life's feet. Dancing to its own hip hop beat. Tribal brothers celebrate. A reunited generation as east and west genetically meet. Yes. Oh yes. Let men dance again together. And trust. And trust each other's moves. Play and explore the possibilities of peace on earth. Brotherhood in truth. When life completes a grand cycle. Humanity. Humanity evolves as faith, hope and charity become. Vision become wisdom and become clarity. And we realize that by being special together. That this is indeed truly our mother's gift. The greatest. The greatest love. Of all. Now what is the next program? Next is... They are... I mean born daily. Mother must have been. She's got a... She's got a... She's got a... Can someone announce what you choose? These are the words. We've got blessing. Love, my dear. It's a video that we hope that you'll watch and if you like it, maybe this is what you'll have. We hope to... We hope to re-establish auspiciousness and the vision of America under Barat. And we hope to incorporate all the talents along the Sahaja Yogis. Not just in America but in Europe. Whoever has a Sahaja Yogis, you can help them up. Thank you. Thank you. These days, music is like making images and in the world. Every love that's flying, we'll see in time. Where angels come from, even powers that meet. Drown in the sea when the cool breeze comes. When the cool breeze comes. When the cool breeze comes. Sacrifices. Over all the time. Where have you gone? Where have you gone? You take your... We have one more song that we don't have a video for yet. The video for this is from a film called Kana Smasi. Which is a life out of balance in the Hopi language. And Richard's in the edge. This is a different song. This is a different song. This is a different song. Music plays. Also we had a beautiful day on the 5th of May this year. Two miraculous photographs have come out. I don't know if you have seen them. So it has been enlarged also. And we were going on a small little ship in... It's near Capri, you see there is a little beautiful island, Capri. And somebody was taking my photographs with other Sahaja Yogisittha. And the last two photographs, he got the photograph of Mysostra. And the second one was the opening and also the Kundalini Mai, Kundalini showing. And the three deity sitting. It's a beautiful photograph, I mean it's really remarkable. Then they enlarged it. And the enlargement you can see beautifully all the petals, the white petals of the Sahasdrava. And the second one is when it opened out. Then they used laser beams and with that they got some different colors. Normally the colors do not change. And all that you can use for your this day. Then there is another thing that happened that in Nepal on 5th of May, they saw the sun surrounded by a beautiful holo of rainbow completely. So they took the part because they couldn't take the whole photograph. Every time the sun was there, part of it. The whole thing, it's never happened like that. But also I know that when I was going to Calcutta they told me that they saw this kind of a beautiful miracle. But this was nicely photographed and they have sent me the photographs on that day. So all that can be put with this showing what is Sahasdrava. It's beautifully these two things I've come out. Imagine my brain is shown in that. With the bones even. Little bit part of the bones is there. It's very interesting. But the small one when enlarged, it's become something different. It's full of petals. So you have had photographs in the sky. I say you had photographs with my light in my heart and on my feet and all that. But this one is something out of the blue I think for Sahasdrava day. So these two photographs you can use and so far the enlargement has not come. I don't know where it is hanging. But I hope you will see it. What is the copy from Austria? Austria has got copies here. For enlargement as well as for the laser beam. By the way we also saw your halo around the sun. Really? When? I don't know about the exact dates but we saw it going actually just the day before we came to come here. So that would have been four days ago. There was a complete halo around the sun and all the dates were in the sky. And the little clouds that have all the prisms in them on the day-times were all through the whole sky. And it came across the Atron in Vancouver in a perfect band on from one side of the sky to the other. Really? Do you photograph it? You should have. I showed you those photographs of the Garuda that you had taken when you traveled back to India. You followed us from San Diego all the way back to India. That one is beautiful. But you see there are so many such things that's happening. A photography has something special, blessings I think, that I don't know if you have seen that photograph of one young boy who was a medical student, just a first year student or something, had an ordinary camera. One of the cameras perhaps you might have given as a present of whatever it is. He took photographs in that. All the dates are sitting behind me and they are throwing vibrations and they are throwing divine flowers, all kinds of things and also angels flying. It's beautiful. So all that has to be enlarged, something has to be done. I don't know who else. I think David Spiro has the negative and he has to enlarge it. So all these things are there which you can use because this idea is good with the photography if you show. These things are very good and with the rhythm. Only thing I feel about whole thing is that the rhythm should be fast, but these words must be said more clearly and again and again so that it goes into the heads of people, you see. Because to them it's just a Latin Greek sort of thing, that should not be. So there is one lady who sings very well. I think she's a realized soul and she has a very fast rhythm when she sings, but her rhythm is behind and when she says the words, she says it extremely with great feeling and clarity, extremely beautifully so, so every word you can follow. No, not Babra. This is Abhidha. She's from Pakistan, I mean she sings in another language, but still I am surprised the way she, she's not bothered about what is happening to the rhythm and she sings so clearly. So it should be very clear, that's all. All right, let's hear the song. How the good brought back the light, the evil thrown down. Today the real human race is nothing like you, my girl. The witness sitting in silent mode, the far-right shababah. Human wind, but the space we already designed our frontier. In the loving hands of grace, step outside our feet. Seize the light in your children's eyes, but live out the love of your soul. Bringing the good back to life, taking the rounds of control. The real human race, but they're meant to be my girl. The witness sitting in silent mode, the far-right shababah. What a day, we love that sense, the joy we'll be. Back in the fold, we'll be a little friendly, we're not alone. Oh, yeah, never too late, turn a page or shelter a spark of hope. Tear in your world, but not a man, meet a ton of men in love. Light that man, but he'll take you in, and sit you in the right place. The good in you will spring to life when she lights her candle. In the middle of the human race, nothing left to write back. This is the final call for affection by the king. The good in you will bring affection and hope. To find the final goal. Action, body, let the law come, jump in and out, jump in and out. Action, body, remember the angel of every man, he will look you in the mirror. Oh. Baby. Oh. Baby. Baby. Baby. Baby. Baby. Baby. These are there too? There's one more but it's very rough. What's it? It could have been a choir, but it could have been a choral song. A choir? A choir in the song coming from here on. You wonder the sing along in the chorus? I think in this kind of song, we've had some kind of chorus which take up one note. Yes, yes. The poetry is very beautiful. The poetry is really beautiful. The chorus is very beautiful. It's a very good song. What are you doing? I'm doing a choir song with a band. You're a song with a band? Yes. I'm a choir. The song is called RIP. You can hear that. It's a good song. It makes it a good thing for me. There is it. One of those bad advice is where am I? RIP RIP RIP RIP RIP RIP RIP RIP RIP RIP RIP RIP RIP RIP RIP RIP RIP RIP aza e emphasize he But how will the public understand? You've got a disc? You've got a disc already? I know I have a piece of just tape that we made at home in the Ashwami. It's available for sale. We haven't finished the... I wanted one that's given first and then we'll try to do the better in the studio. Permission, sir? It's beautiful it is. What is there to ask for permission? Beautiful. I've been selling them the market I think. It's such a... you see the whole theme is so hopeful for people, you know. There must be fed up of crying and weeping and frustrating and showing anger, you see. While something, a hope is here and also the cry for calling people to something good. So, I mean, you can see the concern. Concern and you feel the concern and also a heartfelt wrench that you want people to come to Sahaja Yoga. That can be felt like a cry, you see, like a call as you called it. It's beautiful. Otherwise the songs that they have is never of any promise or any hope these days. People don't sing of hope. They think that is not appealing to people or maybe they have no hopes themselves. So, to be honest they don't want to show false things. But this they like very much. Thank God, bless. It's beautiful. You play the sitar? Yes. Who? Me. You play? Yes. I play the sitar. Okay. I play the sitar. In front of you, there is a dance there and then two kids will be doing bala-bhupara. And then there is a... Say it a little bit further. Say it on the mic. First of all, Sandhya will be dancing. And then Sujata and Seema will be having bala-bhupara dance. And then again Sandhya will be having kulaipuli. I went. Okay. You all came to Europe. Love and I went to India. You can see Europe. You can see Switzerland. In this valley? No, in Europe. Barcelona came. At all gentlemen. Light is in the palm deletion. That's what you have to come to know. That light. That light. That light. Ohôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôôô Because my daughter used to do the sahas.

The sahasra was wearing the sahal like this. The sahasra was wearing the sahal like this. The sahasra was wearing the sahal like this. The sahasra was wearing the sahal like this.

They have no sense of rhythm. However, when they dance their saris fall down, their dhokas fall down, and they put this, they get those, what you call them, tails, pony tails. In the market, in the supermarket, and they attach it with some sort of a glue. They also fall down. So in a proper rhythm, if you dance, you will feel it much more and at the same time you should put the same feet and the way you have to, you can develop a pattern, how will you dance? You see, somebody to develop a pattern, proper pattern, different. Krishna also is very good. So I mean, you can develop different, different patterns, how to dance and that would help. All of us to develop the same pattern. So when you dance, it should look like everybody is dancing in unison. So, what is your name? I am Kavita. What is your name? I am Preeti.

I thought it was the top of the world, I was living alone, it was sad to see. I was dreaming about the truth so long, that's before I found Srimadaji. I truly believe you're what my life's about, sharing my love for the world to see. I truly believe my heart is singing out, cause I have you here with me.

Like this, you see, there are many small, small little places where the saints have worked for the betterment of people because, you see, they are so collected, they can't bear the power to this country and the way these other people are living that we are making people uh.. fatalist is absolutely wrong because no saint has done that. All the saints have made them uh.. work very hard and to work out their problems and they have also told them what's wrong with the society, what is so blind, everything they have done. And this is this gentleman and he was saying that how they emancipated the society. So, you must have gentleman, in a nice work and Bhagya Maharaj was another one, was a saint, no doubt, but he did so much of social work. First he fought for the freedom, I also fought for the freedom of all kinds and then he fought for the betterment of people which I also did and then I started Sahaja Yoga in 1947. When I found that the whole uh.. spirituality is going to the hands of people who are commercializing India, I had to establish and whatever help you need, okay. Where do you live? I see people who are living from my, from the above, from the campers, from the temple and they are migrating there today. There's a room for you. So now you should also understand Shiva's worship is to be understood first of all, how to worship them, how to achieve them. See, Shiva is nothing but your Spirit and all these people are doing that, they are understanding. So we have to understand where are these states and where are all the moments after which everybody is. So we have to see to the essence of it. I'm very happy to meet you. I have a problem with that but I have to become a false self. You want to become? Oh, good I get. I'm very bad at making my problems in my life. Yes, you know, actually we don't believe in sannyas because sannyas is outside but sannyas is within yourself. See, I've been living this life time and now I'm living very well. I'm too very rich one but I can live anywhere. You see Me, I came back in the river, I live anywhere. I have no idea. I have to say that I'm 67 years old. So, you see, the comfort of the Spirit you see. So it's a very nice idea that you have changed and you have decided to become a household. So next time we give you a very good prize. He's a mechanical engineer. Ah, this gentleman who is like a sannyasi and who is like a... I thought I would take a decision of sannyas but the proxy came over giving like a sadhu. Yes, he didn't take a decision, he says, but he was giving like a sadhu. He's such a great man, I must say, to give up everything and to work so hard for the people in education and for spirituality. Now he has decided that he will join Sahaja Yoga and also he'll get married. He's a mechanical engineer. By permission of Mekelmanjiya, I put dollars as sorrys. Once 10 years I fully devoted to Spirit. Look after you, don't worry about that. But also we'll give you a nice wife. How old are you? 48 years. 48 years. My age is 5. If you try to find that, you'll find out. It's so sudden now. I try to find the possibilities. They're all very happy.

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hi! Hi! Welcome to Game Level 3! May the So this is a nice ashram here. This is a nice. What now? This is how I turned out to be something a very wonderful place for Sahaja Yoga. And people are, mostly there are people pollination there. But so much of migrations and the thunderstorms are very, very bad. Except there are lots of civetous, so I despise a lot. I think, if people worship there as it is, it's very good feeling. I suppose you can go. After such a long time I am coming. Last time when I came in Edwin, he gathered in. But he didn't gather anyone afterwards. All disappeared. Suburbs are there. Slowly, slowly you should spread out to suburbs also. Like this Melbourne has 30 meters long, 20 meters broad. So what they started doing is to send one person in one corner, another, another corner, like that. And they had no proper ashram, they all had houses. And now suddenly all of them have joined together. Los Angeles means the angels which were lost or something. What's the Spanish meaning? The angels, Shri Mataji. The angels, haan? The angels. Just leave the angels. Loss is the? Loss is the. I'll give you some. I'll give you some. But this city plays a very big role in the whole culture of America. Very, it's as if in the Vishuddhi as you have got, Hamsa is like that, it's a Hamsa chakra, very important. But extremely money oriented places also. What a big house, eh? What a big house, eh? It's all right. It's all right. Hmm. That place Hawaii has a tradition. When I said Hawa Aai, Aai is the Mother, Hawa is the air, that's according to Marathi language. But it has a tradition, he said, that it is the breath of the Divine and everything they are talking about the breath and the air of the Divine and everything is very remarkable. Most of the things they are saying traditionally are so much like Sahaja Yoga. I want to see Dr. Wadhilikar today. And this is one of the, I think, the most important things that I have seen in the world. I want to see Dr. Wadhilikar today. And this is one of the examples of Sahaja Yoga miracles, I should say. We had another one in Calcutta, when Dr. Khan, who is a very well-known psychiatrist, he fell on his top and fell on his back and the top broke to such a big point and the skull also broke and they said that it had an effect on the brain also. So he became unconscious, they took him to the hospital and they said that he cannot be saved, he will die by tomorrow. He stitched his head up, everything was done, put the bones right and then they telephoned to Me, they had a concussion of brain and God knows how he got it, might be a heart attack, fell so badly and there's a concussion of the brain. So I gave him vibrations and said, that's beautiful. Next day again, next day he started flowing, I said, you must be all right. Even on the phone I said, all right, I'll work it out, don't worry. And next day he opened his eyes nicely, he said, I'm feeling much better and then they removed him from the intensive care to another ward. Then Sahaja Yogis went and gave him vibrations but she never felt, he never felt any pain or anything, he said. And when I saw him, you should see also Dr. Waddigar, he looks at least ten years younger. Just like that he was also looking ten years younger when I went to Canada. With attention many things can work out, no doubt but you also should attention like that. If your attention is cleaned then it will also work, it will also act but still our attention has to be all right. Australia noticed that we have lots of Sahaja Yogis there but they don't meditate, attention is not all right. They are here and there and there and here. I asked them, I said, do you meditate? They said, no, we do not meditate so much regularly, we must be honest. So I said, but this is no good, you have to be honest yourself, you must meditate at morning and evening, other things will never improve, they'll never help you and you'll be in trouble. But I think now it started working very well when they started doing this meditation. Even in the ashram they do not have collective meditation, they do not have any individual meditation. I said, what's the use of having an ashram? You cannot meditate, everybody is very busy. I said, why do you have an ashram? So this is what it is, if you have to really be growing then you must meditate. It's the only way we can do it. I mean you don't have to be meditating, in the sense you do something about it but you have to be in meditation, that's Sahaja Yoga is to be in meditation. That state you must get, you must get into the state of thoughtless awareness and in that state only you can really come up. Because I was surprised that some of them were not even attending body programs, some of them were not even meditating. I said, what will happen after some time? You'll be just like other people, there won't be any difference. And that's what it is very surprising that within ten days or so everybody improved, within ten days. It was such a journey from Perth. I went to Sydney, it's another world, I mean from Perth to Sydney means it's another continent and from Sydney they had a very beautiful place and they told us the miracle of it that there was suddenly they met somebody who said, why don't you try a ground called Scout's Ground Scout's Ground in the center of the city, just in the center. Beautiful, see like a absolute like a jungle inside the city, so quiet you could not hear anything that was going on, birds were chirping, it's beautiful place. They got very beautiful cottages but one of them was a small one, they called it Para Mata. The reverse name is Para Mata, meaning the primordial Mother. So they gave the name of Para Mata and decorated it. The person who was organizing all that was so impressed by them, he said, I've never seen such people, nothing. When I went there, he bowed to Me. He bowed to Me. How could you create such beautiful people? I said, I have not created them, they have made like that but just imagine in ten days time how much they were changed. So whatever it is, you must meditate before sleeping, it's extremely important. Let us see now what happens in Hawaii but I must say David has been very venturesome to go there, started the whole thing in such a good way and I'm sure he will manage them very well, spoke very well also. He was amazed how what a good speaker he was, spoke very well, explaining everything very well and the sentence he used was that it's tangible. This is a new word I learned from him, tangible because normally this word was not used before, it's a modern word, tangible. Sahaja Yoga is absolutely tangible and they got so much interested, it was raining, still they were sitting down. When I went there, I said, but let us change. Went inside another hall which had this platform, suddenly they found it and they all walked out with their, walked in with their chairs and sat down around Me, it's like this, it was very nice. So what should worry about one's own vibrations, one's own vibrations improve, you'll start seeing things much better and when your vibrations are all right, Sahaja Yoga is going to work out much faster, otherwise it's not going to work and as you know that America is a very difficult place so you have to work much harder. You have to really put in lot of priority for, you have to say this about the most important thing is Sahaja Yoga, otherwise we won't be able to achieve much. If you just make it a secondary thing, don't work. Don't have to sacrifice much about it but only your own ascent has to be achieved. If that is achieved, then our problems will be solved, will be much better off. First time I came, I came to Los Angeles first, first time when I came, 1970, see, it was in Los Angeles. All these things are very difficult to do. You have to work out, you have to work out. These people can be very nicely exposed and they will be exposed very soon because they are so fast and the way they talk also people can find them out now. For example, I was just saying yesterday in the night, I saw one man talking daily. He was saying that if you release one hundred, hundred dollar note, you will get one thousand. See, openly, shamelessly, he was talking like this and he was saying one lady sent hundred dollars so she offered grocery so the whole grocery came to her house. All such things. It's unbelievable. How if you can really digest such things, I mean, just could bear it. Instead of saying that you are all stupid fools, instead everything else. And he was brain washing everyone, quotation from Bible. You call them evangelists, isn't it, yourself? Evangelists. So they are the ones who make money out of Bible. So now when we have found out something very genuine, when we have got something so exceptional, unique which nobody knew about, it is our responsibility now that we have to give it to others in every way possible. And if you cannot do that and if you do not do it, then I don't know what to say because that shows that we did not react properly to the timings in which you are born, for what purpose you are born at this time. Very important to understand. You are born at this time to do something so exceptional. The timings are like that. But we have other activities we indulge into, get into other things which are our priorities. They all can be completely achieved if we just meditate ourselves. So I think I'll take you and leave today, tonight. Last night we slept about, I think, three thirty or four o'clock, not up at six o'clock and it's still travelling. I'll miss you. I'll miss you too. I've decided to have Ganesha Puja here. International Ganesha Puja will be here. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

created be our my We're waiting for the past to say I'm all in the time of my life We're waiting for all that to say I'm in my own ship upon the nayash We're waiting for the past to say I'm waiting, waiting, I'm waiting On the time of my life We'll be waiting for all that to say I'm in my own ship upon the nayash We're waiting, waiting, I'm waiting On the time of my life We'll be waiting, waiting, I'm waiting We're waiting, waiting, I'm waiting On the time of my life to the best of the world. I'm a lady, a king, I'm a star, but you're not a man and I'm a man for me. Take it to the night and play I'm a man and play I'm a man and I'm a man for me. Take it to the night and play I'm a man and play I'm a king for my hands. At the video today, we have to know that truth is what it is. We cannot change it, we cannot inspire it. Unfortunately, at this human level of awareness, we cannot know it. This is the reason why in every scripture which is written that you are to be born again. Now whatever I'm going to tell you today, you are not to take Me for granted or not to believe Me blindfolded. We have had lots of problems with these blindfolded ways. But please keep your mind open like scientists and treat this as a hypothesis and if you find that whatever I'm saying can be proved, then you have to accept it as honest people because it is for your individual benevolence. It is for the benevolence of your family, of your spirit, of your country and the whole universe at last. Today I'm going to tell you about our evolutionary process. We have come to the human level but still we don't know the absolute truth. That is why there are problems of discussions, arguments, fightings, also wars. So we have to achieve another state above our mind where we can understand and feel the absolute truth. I say we have to feel it, meaning that we have to feel it on our central nervous system. Which in Sanskrit we call as Godh, from where the Vardhuta is, means to feel it on your central nervous system. It's not just I give you a big sermon or a lecture and you start feeling it. It is of no use. What we are seeking is what I am seeking. What is our self? What is the spirit? We are not this body, this mind, these emotions, these conditionings, these things, this intellect or your ego. Because for this you say, this is my ego, this is my feeling, these are my emotions, this is my body. So who is this mind which owns all these things? Now we have to locate that mind, that is I within myself, that is this body. So you are the pure spirit, that's the thing. The second thing is, you see beautiful flowers around you, we take it for granted. But don't you think it's going to happen? Who does this miracle? Who runs your heart? If you ask a doctor, who runs your heart, he says, autonomous person. Who is this autonomous person? Who does all these works of digestion and also of absorption? It is a thing that we take it for granted. We never even think how living through this works out. So the second truth is that there is All Pervading power of Divine Love. Of Divine Love. And this power does all these things. Also our evolutionary process was worked out through this power which is the All Pervading power of Divine Love. Now we have never felt this Divine Love before. And we do not know if it exists. But today the time has come for thousands and thousands of seekers and pros to feel this Divine Love, to be connected with that Divine Love. Is it all right? To be connected with this Divine Power, this All Pervading Divine Power, and this All Pervading Divine Power is waiting for us to be connected. Once you are connected with that power the union is the yoga, the spiritual yoga. It is not standing on your head for the all kinds of acrobatic things. It's yoga. Yoga is the connection with this All Pervading Power of Divine Love. This All Pervading Power of Divine Love is the one that has all living dual. We have never used the power of love. We have only used the power of that. But once you are connected with it then this All Pervading Power of Divine Love starts flowing through you. And you feel you have become a channel of this great power and you achieve many things through it. First of all you have been told about this power of Kundalini which is in the triangular bone. Now this bone is called as sacred that means the Greeks knew it's a sacred bone. The awakening of the Kundalini is just like a threemule in the seat which has to go. When it arises from its seat and passes through six centers seventh center is below. Six centers when it passes it nourishes you. It nourishes your centers. It integrates your centers and ultimately it enlightens those centers. Most of the problems of this world come from human beings and all the problems of human beings come from the Sahaja Yoga of these centers. If you can put these centers right physically, mentally, emotionally you are once one. I must tell you in Sahaja Yoga now there are four doctors in New Delhi University who have got MD for curing diseases which are absolutely incurable. I very recently that cancer and all such diseases which cannot be cured because they are psychosomatic can be easily cured with this awakening. Another thing is when this light of the Spirit comes into our attention it is very surprising that we become aware of all the things that we are doing which are destructive. I don't have to say don't do this and don't do that. It's not the time to say that. But once you have the light you just take the things which are constructive for you. I give an example supposing I am a very obstinate person and there is darkness I am holding on to a snake and you come and tell me that there is a snake in your hand. I will not give up. I'll say no. Till it bites you. But supposing there is little light then immediately you drop it. So the enlightenment is the foremost thing that you ask to understand what are we doing? What is the purpose of our life? Science cannot answer the questions. Firstly science is limited. It is a model and cannot answer many questions. So we turn to religion. Of course all these great saints and incarnations and prophets came on this earth to establish within us religion which is a balance. But balance for what? Balance for ascent. Like if your brain has to ascent it must have a balance. So this idea that you must have a religion is very, very essential ascent. The problem is now take for example Christianity or Islam or Judaism. Christ and nomads are really great divine personality no doubt. Extremely pure. But they never understood what human beings are because if you read in the Bible the fifth chapter of Matthews Christ has said if you your heart is committing a sin thing if your hand is committing sin, cut it out. If somebody slaps you on one cheek, joint or other thing imagine if this was followed how many people in the west also in the east would have had their eyes and hands intact. The same thing happened in Ramaswami. First of all he thought that Christ can be very strict with men. So let us be strict with women. And he also used Shri Yaga, Shri Yaga as they call it which is another very difficult thing to follow because this Shri Yaga came to Jews by Moses. Moses when he came back with his step commandments he saw the decadent suicide of the Jews. So he said no, this is the scenario to follow which is very very difficult. Impossible. So I think the Jews gave it up and the Muslims took it over. But the worst is with the women. So to become a Muslim or a Christian or a Hindu or a Jew you have to have the capability and that is only possible if you get your enlightenment. If you are a self-dice person if you are really a twice-corner it's not like this like any brand like a Christian, Hindu, Muslim or twice-corner. It's just a brand. Anybody can come in, any sin. There's nothing immediately that is awakened by going to one particular religion or any other and that is the reason people don't understand that why in the name of God they are fighting why in the name of God so many men feel and now really just the name of God is used. But actually that what is described is not being established within yourself. With such a big human quality it was impossible really to follow these great people. Now in Sahaja Yoga the first thing you try to do is to awaken not only Me and to give Sahaja Yoga. You'll be amazed once you get your Self-realization you have the Self-knowledge in the sense you know all about your centers and also you know the center of others because a metaposome has become metaposome, a drop has become the ocean. Who is the origin? You can feel the chakras or the centers of another person on your fingertips. You can feel your own centers also on your fingertips. Mohammed Sahib has said at the time of resurrection your hands will speak and they will give witness against you which they will tell you most of the time. This is the time of that resurrection, Yama or if I call the last judgment. So again the judgment is like this that you are given freedom. If you want you can go to heaven or if you want you can go to heaven. This is the last judgment but it is your desire which is important. If you do not have the desire nothing can be forced on you because it is something that is your freedom which is to be respected. So the first thing that happens to you that your attention becomes absolutely innocent. Many people believe that their innocence is lost. It is eternal, it cannot be possible. Only there are some clouds. With this awakening the innocence comes out and a person becomes extremely innocent and his attention becomes devoid of all lust and cruelty. Automatically it happens. It is your potential immunity which acts. It is you who has all these glorified qualities. It's your own power which enlightens you by which you see yourself as to be something very much in the realm of divinity. As if you enter into the kingdom of God. So many miracles take place one after the other. In your lifetime that you are amazed how this has happened how it has worked who has said that who has guided you and gradually you start understanding that this is what I have achieved I am now in the kingdom of God. But you become extremely humble. You become dynamic and you always dynamic. I have known many artists in India who have become now world famous. Like you must have heard the name of Amzadar. You must have heard about the Deva Chodhi. There are so many scriptures in Kasti. All of them came to Sahaja Yoga and now to be a great artist. There are many painters there are many poets who have suddenly come out after their realization. All their potential starts manifesting. But they do not get it. With that the ego of what they get is humility. They become extremely humble extremely dynamic at the same time extremely compassionate. Now when these sectors become absolutely clean you feel absolutely one with complete intuition. Otherwise normally what we think the heart doesn't angry or give up says no God has done it. But once you are ready and I show you you become completely intelligent and you get all the powers that you can give realizations to others you can give them peace and joy and you are the one who can transform others. It is something never happened before that you can awaken them completely. You can change their lives and that is how this is spreading so fast sahaja yoga. I was saying that in Russia I was surprised because they never believed in God officially they were bad. They never believed in divinity. They never believed in the higher life. That means they were like a clean slate they were not conditioned. They didn't have any conditioning and thousands and thousands of them got their realization. Best part of their sensitivity is that they did not believe in any false masters. They didn't take to any false masters. While in the West you know all kinds of people came from India of which are very much ashamed just to make money. How can you make money in the name of God? You cannot because God doesn't understand you. He doesn't understand you. Thank you. There is nothing to do with all this. This is your area not his. But when we start paying money for a good or for church or for mosque or this or that what do we do? We think we are purchasing God. You cannot purchase. You cannot organize God and you cannot purchase God. So you cannot organize people in the name of God. Automatically they get Now see these flowers. How they are automatically organized? You see a tree now I have seen a lot of what India so beautifully. How it is that every leaf gets the sun's rays and now all leaves have to fall down changing the color because it's the nature. Nature's play that they have to fall down to create nutrition like fruit for the tree to grow and allow this Mother Earth to have the sun's rays. It's all being planned and beautifully done. Except in the case of human being they will be able to come to you free level to choose from. Now when you start analyzing everything you are automatically connected. You have to go beyond this mind because this mind is a limited thing and that state is described in every scripture which we have to get. Now this is the power that connects you to the mains like we have this instrument here and it had to be connected to the mains otherwise it is useless. In the same way you are to be connected to that all pervading power of the wild Earth which is at hand which is very easy to than have. We are living all the time on the thoughts from the future and the past. If I say come to the present you cannot. The jumping on the cusp of the one thought that rises falls, another thought rises falls. On that you are jumping and you feel so sometimes tired, really tired because your mind is all the time thinking. But when Kundalini rises she elongates these thoughts and she establishes that pause where you become one with the present and the present is the reality not the past which is finished and the future doesn't exist. So you establish your attention in a state which we call as thoughtless awareness which is in Sanskrit is in Jara Samadhi. The second state when you start using these powers and understand the divine laws then you become doubtlessly aware. It happens to some people instantaneously but some people take little time especially the ways we start agonizing everything thinking about it. But if you somehow or other jump into that second state then you become doubtlessly aware. At that time your powers start manifesting and you are amazed at yourself how things are working out. You cannot achieve it. Then your attention which is enlightened wherever you put it, it acts. First of all as a result you are in the present, you are absolutely peaceful. Absolutely peaceful. Now My Mother says I must say 72 years now I'm going to but I don't worry. I'm planning now came from New York today only 5 o'clock and today only I have this program tomorrow again I'm going to Vancouver, tomorrow is the program goes on like this but to Me it does not matter because I don't think and in thoughtless awareness. So once you are in thoughtless awareness you get your inspirations and also you get your peace. You become a peaceful person. You don't shout, you don't get angry, you don't get your stress which is a very modern disease that has come stress. You just become extremely peaceful and you watch the whole game and such on. Because you are out of your problems you can solve them better also and there is a peaceful state where you are given all the help to solve your problems. Many people were surprised how their problems were surprising. They believe in God almighty. They may be going to church most or 10% but they never had this kind of experience and they are amazed how their problems are solved. Who is doing this job for them? All the angels are there and you feel that they are there. Now the time has come in and everything has started. But above all you jump into the ocean of joy, into the ocean of joy. You have seen those singers how they were singing with joy. Joy is simply welcome. Happiness and unhappiness are the two sides of one call. Like when your ego is pampered if you get it. When it is punctured you feel unhappy. But joy is something absolutely secular is enjoyed and this is the thing that is what we are seeking in everything. Whether we are seeking in money, in power in so called love or anything that joy you immediately start to feel that you have really jumped into the ocean. All this whatever I am saying is of no use unless and until you really feel it. And this is the only work if I have done about this is that this happening was done for one person one master and one survivor. But what I have done is this was that I have found out a way by which masses could be created. It should be en masse realization and the feelings. So it's a collective happening. Many people get their realization and then they get lost. This is their problem. You have to grow and for that you have to come to collect the feeling. Coming to the collective you know each and everything within one month you will be masters. You don't have to pay for it. How much can you pay for this value of it? Only you have to respect yourself your self realization and you have to grow and forget about all the ideas of seeing and that you are so bad and you are so bad and how can you be? That is something is absolutely is of no use. So we have about fifty minutes more we need to get self realization. But I would request you that if you want to go away you can. If you don't want to have your self realization please leave the hall because it's only fifteen minutes but you will disturb others if you do not want to do what I have to tell you or what has to be achieved. It's very simple something very difficult sahaj also means very simple but sahaj means sah in its and sah in its born is with sah in which is born. Born with you is the right to get this yoga this union with the divine. So whatever said in the books in the scriptures you are amazed to see that it's all working out within yourself. Actually all these people suffered so Christ actually for three and a half years worked. The rest of the time he could not talk to people he had gone through with. Even Mohammed Sahib was given poison and nobody would listen. There is a poet in India Kabira will say, how am I to tell them they are all blind they say samajhaa no sahaja gaandha and this is what they felt their frustration of the day. So many of them really have been eating their lives very early, very very early and that is how they didn't know how what to do with it, how to tell them what's wrong with them. Because once you start telling them this is wrong, that is wrong they will just go but now a special time has come, I call it as blossom time when there are so many people who want to know the truth. William Blake has said it that men of God will be born in those days and they will become blind. Also they will have power to make others divine. He was a seer he could see that but people considered him to be a mad man because he could talk to people. Now for you you have this experience is very very simple and easy but this power of Kundalini is the power of pure desire. All other desires are not pure because today we want to have a house we want to get a house we want to have a car we get a car we want to have a helicopter goes on like this so we are never satisfied with what we have and he said in economics also that in general words are not satiable but this is the only desire whether you are aware of it now or not which is satisfied and this desire that satisfies you is the only desire which is pure. You may be aware of it or may not be and the desire is this is the one which is all-pervading divine power. Now this power of Kundalini is your own Mother like a tape recorder she has did everything about it she knows everything about it she she knows what you are aspiring what mistakes you are going to but she is the power of you like your Mother took all the trouble upon herself and gave you birth in the same way this Mother of yours which is your individual Mother gives you your second birth and it is remarkable how smooth this she was and how you get it I wish you all luck so that you all get your Self-realization again I will wait for a minute those who want to go can be the hall if we just take three minutes and see I'm so very happy that all of you want this Self-realization that means you are all great people great people on your way to become saints you don't have to change your clothes you don't have to do any of all these things it is inside that happens you don't have to go to Himalayas and stand on your head it just goes inside you see now there are three conditions which are very simple to do to run with you is very simple the first one is not to feel guilty about anything after all you are human beings and to earth is human you are not God's if you have done any mistakes it's all right you should have faced it at that time but don't carry on with it because actually what happens when you feel guilty this center here on the left hand side gets aching problem and you develop you can get into the disease which you call as angina could be spondylitis also could be lethargic organs so one has to understand that why should we feel guilty for nothing at all it's a myth why should we all the time try to condemn ourselves you are aspiring for higher life so please respect yourself and you are glorious please I request you not to condemn yourself for anything and do not think of I should say what sins you are committed moreover I feel that this kind of an attitude towards yourself brings you lot of unhappiness and sadness so there is no need to feel like you are not guilty contrary you should be very pleasantly placed towards yourself at this moment and forget all these things about sins you are not to confess anything in such a way there is no need your Kundalini your Mother knows everything about you you don't judge yourself she will be the one who will judge and she will be the one who will correct so you don't have to judge yourself and condemn yourself at all this is possible also in the west is a fashion to feel guilty for everything because there are so many norms that are made that even if they use a spoon or a spoon in a different way they feel guilty so one has to be really very light hearted at this time not to condemn yourself the second condition is that you have to forgive everyone this is another religion if you don't forgive then what do you do you torture person you play into wrong hands many people say it's difficult to forgive whether you forgive or don't forgive what do you do you don't do anything but by not forgiving you play into wrong hands so why carry on with this kind of a myth you torture yourself the worst thing is this center here on the optic chalmers like this absolutely constricted at the top if you don't forgive it won't work and the Kundalini won't pass so you will also miss the great opportunity of becoming the center so what's the use of carrying on with this mythical business of not forgiving is the easiest thing just you have to say I have to give everyone in general don't even think about it because it's a headache you think about something third condition is simple when you accept this too take out your shoes because this Mother Earth helps you so much so if you don't mind please take out your shoes good luck please have complete faith in yourself that you are going to get your Self-realization I have mentioned to you don't doubt this I assure you in my lecture if I have said something that makes you feel difficult please get the lecture also now you know there are two powers left and right and these are different from each other so the left power is for the power of desire mundane desire and the right one is for the power of action so we put both our feet apart from each other because you don't have to pass now sitting down on your chair here you are going to get your Self-realization as I told you you don't have to go to Himalayas or anything no ostricating, nothing just have faith in yourself now please put your left hand towards me like that this indicates or symbolizes that you want to have your Self-realization it's the desire, power of desire now with the right hand you nourish your centers first the heart please put your left hand towards me on your left hand in the heart resides the Spirit Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty in your heart it resides but if you become the Spirit in the life of the Spirit you become your own guide, your own master so please take down your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side your one thing on the left hand side here you have to say that you are your own master but that you can later on just now you put your hand now please take your hand right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side we are working only on the left hand side this is the center which gives you all the knowledge of pure Divine laws it's difficult to understand but later on you will know how it does now raise your right hand again in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side then on the heart then in the neck in the corner of neck and your shoulder and turn your head towards the right I've already told you that this center is there gets to problems when you feel guilty and surprisingly today I think you all have problems but you don't now please remember you are not to feel guilty now raise your right hand on top of your forehead across and please put down your neck slowly as far as possible at this center you have to forgive everyone in general without thinking about it now please take your right hand to the back side of your head and push back up your head as far as possible at this point or at this center without feeling guilty without counting your mistakes just for your satisfaction you have to ask forgiveness from this all permitting Divine power please everyone should do otherwise you know you say I didn't get the vibration please now stretch your hand fully why is she like stretch your hand fully like that put the center of your palm out of the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood now I'm telling you about the actualization of the Baptist it's not just I put some water here and see your Baptist but actualization means the cool breeze of the morning rose starts coming out of your fontanel bone area now rest back your fingers so that there is a very good pressure on your scalp now please bend your head and move your scalp with a pressure slowly clockwise 7 times bend your head bend your head push back your fingers don't move the hand so much as the scalp push back your fingers so there is a good pressure now that's all we are doing that's all now remember to put both the feet apart from each other left hand on your left hand sit comfortably, do not slouch or you just do not strain yourself, okay now you have to close your eyes until and until and until and until you please just keep them closed please put your right hand on your heart and please close your eyes here you have to ask a very fundamental question about yourself in your heart you can call me Mother or Shri Mother so please ask a question three times Mother am I the Spirit? ask this question in your heart three times Mother am I the Spirit? Mother am I the Spirit? ask this question I have already told you that if you become the Spirit you become your own guide you become your own master now please take the right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side here you have to say another question you have to ask me three times Mother am I my own master? ask this question now please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side I have already told you that I respect your freedom and I cannot force the divine knowledge on you so you have to ask for it this second has got six petals so please ask six times in your heart Mother please give me pure knowledge of the Divine you have to ask for it as soon as you ask for the pure divine knowledge of the Guru this Kundalini starts rising up so we have to enrich our higher centers with our self-confidence so now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and here you have to say with your full self-confidence ten times Mother I am my own master Mother at the very outset I told you that you are not this body, this mind this conditioning, this ego, this intellect all these emotions but you are the pure Spirit so now raise your right hand on top of your heart and ask say twelve times in your heart with full self-confidence Mother I am the pure Spirit this all-pervading power of Divine Love is the ocean of knowledge ocean of compassion ocean of bliss but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness and whatever mistakes you might have committed can be easily dissolved by this ocean of forgiveness so please raise your right hand in the corner of your right hand shoulder and turn your head to your right and now forgive yourself by saying sixteen times Mother I am not guilty I've already explained it to you that whether you forgive or don't forgive you don't do anything actually but when you don't forgive you play into warm hands at this moment if you don't forgive then this center and the optic child now won't open and you may miss out your Self-realization which is very important so please raise your right hand on top of the forehead across and put down your head and here you have to say not how many times but from your heart Mother I forgive everyone in general please don't think about that hope you have to forgive just in general you should say Mother I forgive everyone now without feeling it without counting your mistakes just for your satisfaction you have to ask forgiveness from this All-Pervading Power so please put your right hand the back side of your head and push back your head here you have to say again without feeling it O Divine Power if I have done anything wrong knowingly or knowingly please forgive me say it from your heart not how

I'm a general practitioner and what's here I think you call a family physician. And I've been, I work within the NHS, I've been doing this work for about ten years or so. So if I could just pick up on a few of the Dr. Patrick remarks about the type of patients that we see and who we may think of benefiting from, complementary therapies. The most difficult part of my work is dealing with people with chronic illnesses, chronic distress whether it comes from physical or psychological or social problems, difficulties in life. Those are the patients that really pose the difficulties. And those are the people that maybe are going to benefit most from non-drug approaches. I've been interested in sagg yoga myself for about twenty years and that's, I'm mainly going to be talking about the research which is being carried out specifically into sagg yoga. But if you look through the literature about yoga and meditation in general, it's surprising how many illnesses, how many different conditions you'll find where there aren't published studies. Just to run through a partial list, there's hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, asthma, osteoarthritis, diabetes, epilepsy, migraine, anxiety, depression, stress, chemical dependency and obsessive compulsive disorder. So I believe in the US now, you have more patients consulting complementary practitioners than consulting conventional doctors and I think we're not far behind in Britain. So as I said, I myself have been interested in sagg yoga for twenty years and there are quite a number of doctors who have been practicing for that sort of length of time. When I first came in I was quite skeptical I suppose about the benefits to health, about the benefits to myself. But what really intrigued me were my own experiences. If I could have the first slide please. This is a diagrammatic representation of what we call the subtle system and this is mainly what Shri Mataji is going to talk about when she arrives. So I won't discuss it in any detail but just to say that I myself have experiences which relate to this system. The other thing which struck me and various colleagues was how many people who have been practicing yoga would come up to us without any prompting and say that their health had benefited in various ways. So I decided to undertake a questionnaire survey. I distributed questionnaires amongst the practitioners just asking them to report in the first instance whether they felt their health had improved or not. And these are the results. Basically those people with health index 4 or 5 reported that their health had improved. So the message of this slide is that in general the longer the people who had been practicing the meditation the more that they felt that their health had improved. And the sorts of illnesses that people would describe were not on the whole major life threatening conditions but the sorts of things I have been talking about. Chronic musculoskeletal problems, mean rate, asthma, minor psychological illnesses. So that's the first study. I'm now going to move on to talk about some research which has been carried out in the University of New Delhi. Over a number of years under the auspices of Professor Rai who as Dr. Katchek has already mentioned was here two years ago and gave a lecture. The first part of this research project was to look at the physiological effects of sarg yoga meditation. So the message of this slide is that as people meditate, galvanic skin resistance increases. And as people learn sarg yoga over the course of 16 weeks the baseline if you like also increases. Blood lactic acid concentrations decrease. Urinary VMA decreases. Systolic blood pressure decreases. So to summarize the physiology we can say that it's all consistent with the reduction in sympathetic nervous activity. Other observations were an increase in alpha activity on the EEG and in a separate study at McMaster University it was shown that beta endorphins rise whilst people are practicing. Moving on now to a number of clinical studies. First is hypertension. This is a study in which 15 hypertensive patients were followed up for 16 weeks. As you can see the diastolic blood pressure fell from an average of just over 109 to 86. I'm sorry. And the systolic blood pressure that fell from about 170 to 135. And this was despite a reduction in medication amongst the sahaja yoga group. So essentially a group of uncontrolled hypertensives where their control was improved and yet their medication was reduced. In asthma, 9 patients again followed up for 16 weeks. This slide shows a significant improvement in lung function and there was also a reduction in the number of acute asthma attacks. Again, in most cases there was a reduction in the medication taken. Third study was on epilepsy. 10 patients followed up for 6 months and over that 6 months the average frequency of the attacks was reduced from over 4 to less than 1 attack a month. And 3 patients had stopped having attacks altogether. So those were all fairly small and fairly short studies done in India a few years ago. They've all been replicated in Australia. There's currently a research program underway at the University of New South Wales and they are moving on to do larger and more rigorous studies. So that is my presentation. We're going to move on now. I'm going to ask Dr Ashish Pradhan to come. He is a clinical pharmacologist currently working for Bristol Myers Squibb in Montreal where he's the project manager of health outcomes and economic evaluation. So Dr Pradhan. Thank you. Dr Pradhan. Dr Pradhan. Okay. Dr Pradhan. Very, very succinct and brief presentation regarding the studies that have been conducted so far in Sahaja Yoga. What we are going to try to do over the next 10 minutes or so is to take a very quick, very brief overview of the subtle system to which he alluded and about which you shall be hearing in further detail and with a much more wonderful presentation from Shri Mataji herself. But as a background to what we are going to see just now and what you are going to hear from her, perhaps it would be pretty useful just to know what the subtle system is about and what kind of role does it play in our body and what kind of effect would it have on the health outcomes vis-à-vis the model of Sahaja Yoga. We are also going to see very briefly some epidemiological evidence regarding some of the hypotheses. So what we can at the present moment certainly regard as hypotheses regarding the etiology of certain things. The causal relationship or the causality assessment as we specifically would do in more rigorously controlled studies is certainly an issue where you deal with the whole paradigm of meditation and its effects on health. But what we have tried to do here is based on what Shri Mataji has been saying for the past 30 years, we have tried to get from the available medical literature whatever evidence may be available to see if we can find evidence that kind of conforms to those hypotheses that Shri Mataji has been talking about for the past almost three decades. So we shall come to that in the latter half of the presentation. So this is the overview of the presentation. We shall be taking a look at the subtle system. We shall be looking as to what is the etiology of disease according to the model of Sahaja Yoga. Then we shall be looking at the epidemiological evidence and we shall be concluding with some key messages. So the subtle system is composed of what are called in Sanskrit as Nadi's or channels of energy and they correspond basically with the autonomic nervous system. Then we have the centers which are called as Chakras and they correspond with the nervous plexuses. Finally we have within each one of us situated at the base of the spine, the triangular bone, a residual garment energy which is called as the Kundalini energy. So for the purposes of introduction these are the three most important components that we have to bear in mind. The Nadi's are predominantly again three in number. On the right side we have what is called as the Ida Nadi and this side governs our emotions and it corresponds to the right sympathetic nervous system. Then we have the left side on the Pingala Nadi, sorry I have got it, the Pingala Nadi which corresponds to the right sympathetic nervous system, sorry that's a Thai Gopin and that part governs our actions. And then finally we have the Susumna Nadi which is the parasympathetic, which corresponds to the parasympathetic nervous system and this governs our evolution. The Chakras are predominantly seven in number, we shall quickly run through them. At the bottom we have what is called as the Mooladhara Chakra which corresponds to the Oxygen plexus. We have the Swatishthana Chakra which corresponds with the Aortic plexus. We have the Manipura Chakra which corresponds with the Ceniac plexus. We have the Anahata Chakra which corresponds with the Cardiac plexus. We have the Vishudhvi Chakra which corresponds with the Survival plexus. The Agnya which corresponds with the Optic Thiasma and the Sahasrara Chakra which corresponds predominantly with the Limbic system. The Kundalini is basically as we just said is a dormant residual energy and it is the instrument of our self-realization through its ascension and establishment of union or yoga. Yoga as Shri Mataji has said is basically the union. So when the union takes place we say that the real yoga has occurred. So in other words what it basically alludes to is the fact that yoga in the classical sense has got nothing to do with physical postures or those kind of calisthenics. But it is an innate internal happening and it is basically the occurrence of the union. And the Kundalini energy is the instrument through which this union can take place. So what is self-realization? It is the upward ascent, if one could define it, it is the upward ascent of the Kundalini energy through the certain centers and establishment of the union through the All-Pervading Divine Power. It manifests, and this is extremely important, it manifests as the flow of a cool breeze which in Sahaja Yoga we call as vibrations, from the palms of the hands and from the top of the head. Let us try to take a look as to what is the ethiology of disease in Sahaja Yoga. Basically we have to then define what is a health state, what is positive health according to Sahaja Yoga. So it is basically we can simply characterize with three conditions. No blockages on the chakras or on those energy centers. A harmonious and steady flow of the cool breeze through the palms of your hands and from the top of the head and a state of complete balance within the subtle system. So when the internal system which is within us as Dr.Spiral alluded to and which we have just taken a brief look at, if all the elements within that system are in perfect harmony, are in perfect balance, then we say that that is positive health. So obviously disease would be a disturbance in this state of balance. So primarily the cause of disease according to Sahaja Yoga is an imbalance in the subtle system, secondary to blockages in the chakra. This is a very simplistic kind of a mechanistic model of understanding disease through Sahaja Yoga. Now if we have to understand what is the causal relationship between imbalances as we keep on repeating ourselves and disease manifestation. So if we have to understand that, then we have to understand, we have to look at just some of the hypotheses that Shri Mataji has been saying over the years and we are going to examine just three of those hypotheses for which we have found kind of evidence in the literature. These are not studies that Sahaja Yoga has conducted as compared to what Dr.Spiral alluded to. All of those were studies done by Sahaja Yogis. These are studies which are available in the literature and they were retrieved through the search of medical databases like Medline. So basically the first hypothesis is excessive and inappropriate activity of the right sympathetic nervous system, which is your Pingala Mani on the right hand side, leads to a direct effect on the heart center. Let us just take this hypothesis as it is at the present moment and examine how it pans out. So basically when we say excessive and inappropriate, it means that if a person is more likely by nature to get angry pretty quickly or has increased hostility within him or has a kind of a domineering nature because the right side governs our actions. Yes, we need to perform our actions but actions have to be tempered with compassion, with the right quantum of the emotional input. Otherwise it tends to go into a system of imbalance. Let us keep in mind that due to the constraints of time we cannot go into too many details but this is a simplistic notion of what excessive right side activity would mean and its effect on the heart center. Bearing that in mind, the first study was the ARIC study published by Williams et al in Circulation just a couple of weeks ago. The investigators were from Duke University and from Johns Hopkins University here. The design was a prospective study of 13,000 individuals for over five years for the association between anger trait and the risk of combined cardiovascular events and heart events. So called soft events were incidents of angina, non-fatal myocardial infarction as compared to heart events like acute MI and CHD or tardisic and triclobutamine. Basically the patients filled out a questionnaire and kind of identified whether they had an anger trait, whether they were more likely to get angry relative to some other people that they know, that they did not lose their temper that fast and so on and so forth. Once their baseline was measured, this was a part of atherosclerosis risk in community study which was done all over the United States. The results, if we look at the odds ratios and I presume most of us are aware of what odds ratios are, it is the likelihood of the event in the, when you take a ratio of events occurring in a particular group which is an exposed group, which is a group of interest and the denominator is different groups. So if you look at the odds ratios, for high versus low anger, it is 2.2 and the 95% confidence interval which means statistically significance can be attributed to this study and they range from 1.36 to 3.5 which means if you are a person who sees himself as getting angry pretty fast as relative to someone else, your chance of getting a fatal MI or a cardiac event is between 1 to 3 times as compared to someone else who does not apparently have that trait. For heart events in fact it was 2.6 with a confidence interval of 1.4 to 4.9. The second study was done in Portugal by Coelho and colleagues and it was published in the Journal of Cardiovascular Risk last year. It was again a case controlled study where cases of acute market infarction were compared to controls and what was found out is again cases of AMI versus controls, type A behavior was found to be a significant predictor of acute market infarction and it was also found out that they have significantly more depressive symptoms. So basically what this kind of goes to suggest is that within a psychosocial construct of an individual there was some kind of an imbalance and anger is an emotion that is predominantly controlled by this center which is called as the Agnya Chakra and it has like we said in the first, as we started off by saying in the hypothesis, indirectly affects your heart. Further evidence with this regard comes from this American study which was published in the American Journal of Epidemiology was conducted out of Willingburg Lake in California. Again it was a prospective cohort study, 2200 men over a 9 year formula and the odds ratios are men with hostility scores in the top quartile had an all cause mortality of 2.3 with a 95% interval of 1.4 to 3.5. Cardiovascular mortality was 2.7 with a CI of 1 to 5 and the last study in this category that we are going to see was published in the cycle journal of psychosomatic medicine by Gallagher and Conings. This was again a random sample cohort study and if you look at the odds ratios the predictive value of a low anger out score of ischemic heart disease events was 1.7. Again it was a statistically significant outcome. In this study what they did was again the patients had to fill in the question there like anger in, anger out, do I express myself when I am angry etc. So basically these studies kind of show us that out there in the world of epidemiology we are now kind of beginning to find evidence which might lend support to the freedoms that imbalance within us especially mediated through mechanisms like anger or hostility may have deleterious effects on cardiac events. Now all these studies that we have presented were done adjusting for traditional cardiovascular risk factors like smoking, hypertension, obesity, diabetes etc. So in a multiple regression model for example even if you adjust for those factors these factors like anger and hostility stand out as independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The second is anxiety or insecurity predisposes women to an increased risk of breast cancer. So this is not incidents of breast cancer agreed. This is breast cancer patients who have been followed up over a certain period of time. And the primary outcome variable here is whether or not they are responding to the same risk of breast cancer. So this is not incidents of breast cancer agreed. This is breast cancer patients who have been followed up over a certain period of time. And the primary outcome variable here is whether or not they are responding to different health. And the results are quite fascinating. The HADS score which is the hospital anxiety and depression score both depression and anxiety were significant independent predictors to chemotherapy. So women who had very high scores of anxiety and depression had a higher likelihood of having recurrence secondary to chemotherapy or failing to respond adequately to chemotherapy. The last hypothesis is we as Swamantaji explains very beautifully that after marriage because marriage is also the spiritual union between the husband and the wife both of them complement each other's state of health. So if the wife is having some kind of problems it does reflect in the husband's health and vice versa. So it's an absolutely complementary relationship between the husband and the wife which also means that behavior of one affects the behavior of another. One would say why do you need a study to prove that? But this study was carried out at the University of Utah under experimental conditions agreed. And what they did was by Brown et al. it was a randomized controlled trial of 45 married husbands in a trial setting to assess whether the perception of spouse or dominance can predict blood pressure reactivity. And the primary outcome was systolic and diastolic blood pressure and we found that, sorry, the results stated that subjects interacting with the spouse perceived as dominant was associated with having a higher blood pressure like both the systolic as well as the diastolic components. So what are the key messages? Psychosocial factors are emerging as significant independent risk factors of disease. Sahaja Yoga presents an excellent model for explaining the role of these risk factors in terms of a possible etiological role. For example, when we say that there is an existence of some kind of an internal imbalance. Sahaja Yoga therefore affords a critical alternative for management of these diseases through a simple and effortless program of correcting these internal imbalances. How that happens, how it all works out is something that you will find out. Misha Mataji is here and she will speak to you. But what we want to say here to these studies is that basically that there is this kind of an evidence out there and though we know that these relationships might exist between these kind of risk factors and heart outcomes, how do you cure? There is no pill that's available, there is no methodology that can account, there is no procedure that you can undergo in order to have an effect on these kind of outcomes. It basically calls for setting right your internal imbalances and maintaining a state of positive spiritual health which then has an absolutely salutary effect on the physical health and this is where Sahaja Yoga can present its. Our next speaker is Dr. Brian Wells. He is a psychiatrist for profession, he is a consultant psychiatrist who practices, specializes in addictive medicine. He is based in central London and has an international private practice. He has lectured at many international conferences and he accomplishes very widely. Dr. Brian Wells, thank you. Good evening, my name is Brian Wells as Dr. Pradhan mentioned. I would like to thank Dr. George Patrick very much indeed for allowing us the opportunity to come here tonight and also to thank you all very much for coming. I appreciate it. It's well past the working hours even though Dr. Spiro and I are operating on UK time which is well past working hours. Congratulations for coming. I know that you are all eagerly awaiting your items too much and I can assure you, you are not going to be disappointed when she comes. We have heard a fair bit about some of the science around Sahaja Yoga and some may be feeling that this is still very rudimentary and one of the reasons why we are eager to present this evening is because we want to actually demonstrate via properly methodologically sound research that the teachings of Shri Mataji actually have a great deal to offer and that they are based on a scientific basis albeit presented in language that some of us may not be aware of. Some of the words like Kundalini, Chakras, Nadi's, etc. may not be familiar to all of us. They certainly were familiar to me as an allopathic trained doctor who in the late 1970s found himself having to become abstinent from alcohol and drugs and go to 12 step meetings. I am sure you all know meetings like Alcoholics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous, etc. Eventually in 1980 I managed to get clean, get sober, go to AA, did my 90 meetings in 90 days and all that. As you may know the 12 step fellowships have a leaning towards spirituality. They are not religious organizations. There is quite a lot of talk about power greater than oneself and the knowledge you understand. As I was progressing through my own recovery I found myself actually looking out for things that made spirituality more meaningful. I tried going back to religion, I tried looking at different types of meditation, some of which I was very attracted to and some of which I wasn't. It was a very personal issue. Being someone who was interested in altered states, in chemical experiences, etc. What I needed was something that was experiential. I found if I sat in a lotus position or a yoga position, for me it didn't really do a whole lot. I was somebody who needed spectacular experiences. In 1982 I met an Indian doctor who I was working with. I was a junior psychiatric doctor. I sat down and had lunch with him and asked him what he had been doing. He said he had been traveling in India and he had met a meditation teacher. When he touched her feet he was plunged into this state of oneness and pure joy and pure knowledge. He felt this cold wind rushing through him. He was in a state of pure joy. To an ex-drug using psychiatrists he was looking for some sort of spiritual direction. This sounded kind of interesting. I said, do you have to be Indian in order to experience this? You certainly had to be Indian in order to understand the terms he was using, like Kundalini and chakras. I have to say that in my own quest I wasn't really a hippie. I never got to India. I would run out of money by the time I got to the airport. I never quite did the Indian trip, which a lot of other people have done. But I found myself interested. I liked this guy. He had something about him that was appealing. I was certainly interested to try this out. I was trying out all sorts of other things. Why not this? He arranged for a couple of people to come round to the hospital where I was going. I had to be on duty that night. They stood behind me. They had a photograph of Shri Mataji and lit a candle. I looked at the photograph and they stood behind me and seemed to wave their arms around and mutter things which I now realize were Sanskrit. They were the same mattresses. I sat there waiting to be plunged into pure joy and knowledge and oneness and ecstasy. It didn't quite happen. What I did feel was this cold experience starting at the bottom of my legs, working its way up my legs and stopping at the base of my spine. I was convinced that there was a draft coming under the door. They said, no, this is the sort of thing that people experience. People have different experiences, but people by and large do have some sort of physical or physiological experience. They then said, well, it started if you just meditate and by meditation I mean just looking at the photograph, using a candle and just achieving a state of thoughtlessness. This will just happen for you. You don't have to do anything. It will just work itself out. They left me with the photograph and with the candle. I have to say I was a little disappointed. I was hoping for a thunderbolt to come through the window and enlighten me with oneness with God. That hadn't happened. After I'd gone, I did know that something had happened. It was something that was totally free. Nobody had asked me for any money. It was also something that I knew in my heart was perfectly safe. This was not going to harm me. There was no question I had to wear funny clothes or eat strange food or do anything that I felt uncomfortable with. The people who'd come around and see me, they were working. They'd come around after work. After a normal day, they were doing one. One was a computer expert and the other was his wife. There was nothing odd about them. They didn't have weird beads on or anything. So I felt completely relaxed. After they'd gone, I became aware of this. It was as though it was a bubble of air that was following me around. It was sitting on top of my head and following me around wherever I was. I was also aware that my visual perception had changed slightly. I remember looking at the on-call room I was in. It had a white porcelain sink with a bar of green soap. It wasn't my soap I had to wear, but somebody left a bar of green soap. It slightly stood out. It was as though I'd taken a small dose of mescaline or something. I was aware that something odd, but something very good had happened. I was on call in this busy hospital. I went to sleep and just slept. My pager didn't go off. I wasn't disturbed. I woke up the next morning and I felt very relaxed indeed. The next day, I had to run around London doing all sorts of things. What I found was really quite odd. This may sound a little cosmic. It may sound as though I need a little anti-psychotic medication. That's fine. But this is what happened. Whenever I drove anywhere, the lights seemed to be green. I just flowed. I had to go on the underground on the subway system in London. I just seemed to walk in. There wasn't a line to buy a ticket. I'd buy the ticket. The train would come in. The doors were open. I'd get on the train and go. Instead of waiting in line for more hassles that I was used to, I seemed to be in touch with some sort of synchronicity. Things were just flowing and things were effortless. I was very conscious that this was unusual. It was a strange experience for me because I was used to having a hassle and having to fight my way through London and work hard to make things happen. I think we'll just pause for one second because Shri Mataji is here and the stage is a bit dark so she needs to lead the way over to the stage. I'm just going to stop and then when she's seated, I'll carry on for a second. It seemed to flow, this cool business that was referred to earlier by the previous speakers, it just seemed to flow and it made me calm down. It worked very well actually in conjunction with my 12 step program. What I was impressed with was that there was no money involved. I didn't have to do anything strange. I could carry on working as a doctor in a busy western city. If I just practiced this meditation as was gently suggested to me and did little things to help myself clear up such as put my feet in warm water in the evenings. That felt pretty strange sitting with my feet in a bucket of warm water with salt in it but actually it made me feel a lot better. For me what I really liked about it was that this was experiential. It wasn't some academic process, it wasn't something I had to sit and read, I didn't have to learn Sanskrit, I didn't have to do anything other than just experience what was being suggested. I gradually began to meet Shumataji and go to meetings where there were large numbers of people. What really struck me about this is that when there are large numbers of people who are all actually utilizing this energy, then the whole thing actually becomes a very powerful experience because there are energies involved that Shumataji will describe. When there are groups of people doing it together there is a collective accumulation of energy and the whole thing becomes extremely powerful. So I went to a large meeting quite early on and I came away after a couple of days of meditation and larking about and dance programs and theater and things that were put on. It wasn't very joyful. It wasn't a sort of intense let's all sit down and meditate for 24 hours, the sort of experiential stuff that I had kind of ventured into previously and encountered groups and this and that. It was all very joyful and the thing that struck me was that Shumataji by herself was full of joy and she would be describing these very complex processes and there would be laughing and there would be a joyfulness and an innocence and an almost childlike state that folks seem to be in. As well as this extremely powerful experience of the meditation and what that meant for me was when I sat down after one of these meetings I just wasn't thinking. I felt totally calm, completely relaxed and when I did think, every thought I had was spot on. It was pure. I knew it was accurate. I knew that I exactly knew what was going on with my patients and I just had this confidence that when I was feeling like this, which wasn't the whole time, it was after, it did involve doing some work to achieve this state, but when I was in that state, which was a wonderful calm state to be in, I knew that every thought I was having was some form of pure knowledge. It was quite extraordinary. This all happened to me about 18 years ago and since then things have evolved. I now use Sahaja Yoga as part of my practice. I work a lot with addicts, alcoholics. We find an awful lot of people get involved in Sahaja Yoga and their desire to use drugs, to smoke cigarettes, to drink alcohol simply melts away. We don't do intensive counseling. We don't give them detoxes. Some people need to go away and have detoxes and when they come back they find that the balance that was referred to earlier, the state of well-being that was referred to earlier and the flow of energy, particularly when it's done collectively, just seems to lead people into a state of well-being and leads them into a pathway that seems to be in their own interest, which has been very much my own experience. So I found that my career has come together. Life makes much more sense. It absolutely complements everything I was heading towards anyway. It's helped with things like one's value system. One suddenly discovers that driving around in fast cars and things doesn't seem to matter quite so much when this is there as a way of spending one's evening. So hassling around and wheeling and dealing with stuff just didn't seem to make a whole lot of sense. So for me and for a lot of the patients that I've treated subsequently, I'm in no doubt that Sahaja Yoga is based on a scientific basis and it does need to be researched and we need actually to get a lot more data than we're able to present tonight. It's an experiential process. It's not academic. We actually feel physiological cells moving around. We actually feel ourself and we feel energy shifting around in our body and hopefully our technology will allow us to experience some of that this evening. Sahaja Yoga is a complete formula both for prevention of illness, for the diagnosis of illness and for the treatment of illness. It's also entirely free and there are other forms of meditation that aren't. There are other forms of meditation and healing where people are making a lot of money out of traditional spiritual techniques. And for me being free and being something that wasn't forced on me, being something that's natural, gentle and joyful is important. So ladies and gentlemen, I'd now like to introduce the teacher of Sahaja Yoga, the founder of Sahaja Yoga, the person who actually has evolved and developed this form of meditation. I know you're all very pleased to welcome Shumataji Nirmala Devi who is here with us tonight. Shumataji Nirmala Devi, At the very outset I would like to thank the National Institute of Health for inviting me to speak to you people about Sahaja Yoga. Today I'm going to tell you the secrets of medicine. So far whatever we have known in the medical colleges or whatever we have known, there is something beyond it which we should know and utilize our knowledge for a great deal of advantage. Sahaja, Sahaja is with enjoy, he is born with you. With you he is born this right to become self-realized. Yoga is the union with the Divine Power. We have heard about Divine Power in all the books, scriptures, but we have never experienced it. We don't know if it really existed or not. But the time has come for us to experience that. Also in the medical science we know quite a lot about sympathetic neurosystems. But we don't know much about parasympathetic and its control. So the secret I'm going to tell you is how to control your parasympathetic effects. I will not tell you what is parasympathetic and how it works. But then it controls and it balances all the activity of the parasympathetic. If I say there is a power placed in our triangular bone which is called as x, you may doubt that. But this triangular bone is called sacrum, it's a sacred bone, that means the Greek new about it, it's a sacred bone. In this bone is placed in three and a half coils, that is also mathematical, three and a half coils, a power, which is made of milliplets. And which is the one, what we call, is for our ascent, for our last breakthrough. After human awareness, if we had achieved everything in our evolution, there would have been not all these problems. So many problems exist as we know, on individual level, on collective level, on every type of level. Why these problems should be there if we are really fully aware, involved? But we are not. There is something really has to be happened and for that our Creator Himself has placed this power in our triangular bone. Now you need not take My talk as granted, but you should experiment, as all experts do, you must experiment and see for yourself if there is this power or not, if it works or not, does it does not? No giving about it, it's absolutely scientific, absolutely scientific. And once you enter into that arena of secret science, there will be a means that there is so much to be known about ourselves. Now all the scriptures have said that you should know yourself. For us it is some separate subject, not for doctors. It's some sort of a religious subject that you should know ourselves. After all, we are a human being. Now of course we know that there is a doctor for one eye and a doctor for another eye, but this is we are going towards the unity. Unity as a human being, unity as all the movements, all the world, how do we do that? Is there any way of connecting you to that area of Divine power by which you all become like that? For example now, there's a small little piece, doctor has fixed for me here and I am talking to you all. It never happened when I went to college, it was never so, but now it will happen. So the new future, uh, medical science has to understand what is parasympathetic, what is this Kundalini I am talking about, what is the function of this Kundalini, how it works. Now it is like a primule in a seed which sprouts, which sprouts and then it grows into a tree. Firstly, whatever is your seeking, if you have not known yourself, seeking is, may go on and is going on in this country as you know, like a mattress. All your seeking must come to an end, otherwise it has no meaning, waste of life, waste of energy. How can it be that it can be finished is a very, very simple thing. Within you lies this power, whatever may be your color, whatever may be your nationality, your religion, whatever, as long as you are a human being, this Kundalini is there, quite ready to be ascending. It ascends automatically, just like a seed has a view which ascends. You don't do anything. You don't have to stand on your head, nothing of the kind. It is there, so it also means spontaneous. It works out spontaneously. So, it is spontaneous. You all have this power within you and only thing you have to experience this. This rises, this power rises, passes through six centers, I think they have shown them here, and pierces through your fontanel bone area, which you know what it is, I need not tell you, and then pierces through and becomes one with this all-pervading power as this instrument is connected, you also get connected. Without connection this has no meaning. In the same way we do have no meaning, we are going here, there, there, there, there, but we are not yet knowing the truth and the truth is that you are all going to be the Spirit. Now here we come very close to spirituality and to the eternal. Not to be afraid of it. It is a part of the same relationship. It is a part of us. We can't live without the grace of this Divine love or we can all-pervading power. Of course it is not mentioned in these and at least in any one of the books that you might have read, but it is a fact. You have to see for yourself. Don't deny because it was not in your hopes or you have not learnt it from any point of view, but try to see for yourself if it is so. Because how beneficial it is. First of all, all these centers are responsible for your physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being. Now you see there is one psychologist, another is a doctor and they will do all that because we don't know anything about psychology. I always tell you that your psychological, all these knowledge is like a child's knowledge. Then the right side which is, I should say, is the knowledge of the body, of the body in the physical self and also the mental self is also not good. What you know is outside of your position. For that what you have to do is to first of all get your realization. That at least you should have. Nothing happens to you. There is nothing to be frightened about. There is nothing to doubt about. You all have to have your self-realization, that is the self-knowledge. Once you have your self-knowledge, you know all about your chakra, on your fingertips you can feel what's the problem with you, what's the problem of another person. For example somebody has cancer. Now he has to go through such a lot of rhythm and old, to dilute the whole thing. Sometimes people die during that time. But it's only on your fingertips you can say what is the disease the person has. On the fingertips. Because you are entitled, you are empowered. But first raise your powers and become that and talking about becoming and nothing else. Unless and until you become that, you won't understand what is the gift of the Divine to you. Once this Kundalini arises, she enlightens all the centers. She integrates all the centers. Apart from that she looks after all these centers. For example I will give you a piece of cancer. Now what we know about cancer is different doctors for different things and all that. But it's very simple. Very simple. You have said, you have left side and right side of sympathetic nervous. Now I don't know in the medicine how far they have gone but when I studied they thought both are just the same. They are not. They are two different systems. One works for the other but in a way it is opposite. So it's complementary. I'll show you now supposing in my hand I'll show you. This is one center coming from the right side, another center from the left side and you put them together. Now this is the spinal cord system for you. Now when you work very hard you are working your right side very much, right side sympathetic very much and you are exhausting your energy in the center whatever it is. Suddenly your left side just breaks. Why? May be some shock, may be some accident, may be anything due to the sickness it breaks. Now it breaks means it has no connection with the center. That means it is on its own. That's how many months it starts. Very simple as that. Now supposing by any chance, by any chance you could raise the Kundalini and push it through both these ends then it turns into a problem. That's how cancer can be cured. Of course Sahaja Yoga has cured cancer. All kinds of cancers it has cured. But we don't want to become doctors, you see. We don't want to do doctor's job, that's your job. But we can tell you how you can cure so many people. The way I got this doctorate on paper I read about one chakra. So because in a short time I can't tell you everything, it's the Swahishtanta that shows you. In the second chakra I read. Chakra is the center, in the subtle center which talks out of your third center that you call as Nabhi chakra. And it starts moving like a lotus orgy. This is the one which looks after all the organs in the spina. This chakra is a subtle one. Of course you may not see the dissection but it is there. Now when it starts moving like this, what happens is that you get too much on one side. Suppose you are working very hard here, then it has to go too hard. If you are thinking too much, we never think how our brain is given energy, from where does it get energy. It is through this center our brain gets the energy. I mean the brain sense, the brain sense gets the energy from this center. Now this center is working very hard so it, and when it starts thinking too much, people who think, think, think, think, think, what happens to them is a simple transfer of energy we should say and this Swahishtana chakra becomes attentive only to the brain. It also looks out in your liver. It looks out in bacteria, it looks out in your spleen, it looks out in kidneys and also the artificial cells. I would say the whole of it is that. That's the job it has to do, this poor one center. Now when you think too much, what first thing can happen to you if something goes wrong with your liver? Now the liver as a function as you know, is to take out all the heat of the body, heat of the body and deliver it into certain ratio of blood. Now that heat accumulates it cannot do it because liver is fading. As a result what happens, this heat starts moving upward. Now this is not in the medical news but I understand, starts moving upward. According to us there is a center, we call it right heart, the right heart, the very important center which we have left out right hand center of the heart, there are three arms. The right heart is connected and you can make Astha mind. Astha mind absolutely pure, 100% pure. No doubt but you have to take to Swahili, that's all. Then this moves from here, the heat goes to the heart. Now when a boy is young, twenty-one year old, twenty-two years of age, is playing tennis and also drinking too much, then what happens that his liver goes out completely and maybe he gets such a massive heart attack that it is fatal, you cannot save that child. But this process goes on and sometimes people get massive heart attack later on. So this is the heat process which goes say from here and moves to the pancreas. You get out also this pancreas affected, you get diabetes. Diabetes is also in store of you to become a serving thing that you. Then it moves down to the kidneys and you get foundation to the kidneys and the kidneys stop. One general, then heat also as I told you goes to the spleen. If the heat goes to the spleen only then it's what we call blood cancer. I shouldn't say but we have cured many blood cancer patients and mostly architects and chartered accountants, all such people get this blood cancer. They are cured. For the last ten years they are living well, they are alright. But we don't cure, we don't want to cure. You have to cure, you have to die, that's your job. I can only tell you what you have done. Then your intestines are affected and you become a super-paradigm. Very constipated person, always constipated. In the common human being, constipated. With this one center settling down with the Kundalini movement, all these problems can be solved. You won't believe, see now, before this if I tell my grandmother that people are going to the moon, she will say, I have not first met her. How can I go to the moon? Now you know it is true. So it's a very fast happening I should say. I call it the jet Kundalini in modern times. And it really works then, it's surprising. Now this happening of one center is so important. There are so many diseases which can be cured if you can look after these centers. Except for two which I will say is one is this. Eats. Because they can be cured but they are extremely arrogant. And they think they are doing a martyrdom, they are martyrs. How can you talk to them? There are some big things like that, the silhouette of themselves. You cannot talk to them. Then another is the almighty. That's another disease which you cannot attend to. Because this comes to people who have been just like killers in their lifetime. They are very aggressive. These people when they get this disease they become even worse. They may even abuse you, they may say everything, they can't get up and hit you but they will say everything that is possible under this disease. So you give up your hopes about that and you say we don't want to have all this abuse. Not that they cannot be cured I mean but it's little too much. Sometimes it's too much to attend to them. I tried on three people then I gave it up. Because when they started abusing me and all that I was surprised that they couldn't receive any vibrations of it. So I said this cannot work out for them. So one has to be humble about it. If you think they have known everything it won't be enough. One thing. Another thing you have to be extremely honest. You have to be honest. You have to be honest to yourself and honest to the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga. It's all for you absolutely, the best that can happen. Now I was told that in this institution you have lot of research for you. I would love you people to do this research also. All of them. All the rest of the gimmicks people have done. All the best. It has not at all scientific in no way. For this you don't have to do much research. Because you raise up to the linear of one person and you will see there is something. It's a tremendous power within. But we don't know our value. That's what we said you should know your value. We don't know what we have. What powers we have. What we can do. Not through book knowledge but through the knowledge of the Divine. So how when we come to that we understand that spirituality and good health, everything is to you. So as a result what do you get? On your fingertips you can feel the centers. Five, six and seven. Just like that is five, six and seven. The right thing. You can feel it. Where is the problem? There is no need to take them to the bar, sing them to a As we are not in this way we can't do this. That's the simple thing about it. And I wish as you have been so kind to be here, you learn what's there. You don't have to pay. There is no problem. Like so many people have suggested that and have written books that if the Kundalini rises then this problem comes and that. Nothing of the kind. Last thirty years I have been told, I have not seen one person anything how do you relate? Never, never. So it is for you just to see to it, spend at the most one month and you will be amazed, you will be masters, you will be masters. Because it's your own power. It is not somebody else's power. It's your own power. It's your own power. Only thing you should have the full knowledge, full knowledge about the secret science of medicine. Because only with this we have no thinking. Medicine is for theorists people and can do. Then this is the best, easiest way. But that doesn't mean you discard. Because you are much more knowledgeable about it, you know what is the problem is. With the symptoms also you can say and you can verify. Very easily you can verify. Supposing you put your hands to something and you feel that person is a psychological place. You find out, you verify. And psychological places are completely pure in Sahaja Yoga. There is one patient who is here who was with you and only two years back I met him. And today he is a pure man. Psychology is very little pure, I must say doctor, I'm sorry. But they think very little pure. Also medically affected people also can be very little. First you must become the masters. You must have the whole powers within. And then you work it out and you will be amazed what powers you have. How much you can do to help this world. Apart from that the best thing that happens is a person gets completely calm from you. I feel, I have written also in my book, that in the genes we have a phosphorus. And if a person is dry, less water, this phosphorus explodes and you get into tempers. Getting into tempers is not your doing, it's just phosphorus works down the neck. So how to get rid of it and how to cure it, it can go up to the point that it changes also your genes. It's very surprising, that's the most important thing that you can transform into. People become so beautiful, so collective, so compassionate, so loving, the life becomes so enriched with all this qualities and you enjoy your life with all of them. So you get your experience. Then you get your peace. How do you get your peace? There is the proof. That our style is to see anything we react. You must, I see this top, table I react, I see people I react. But with Kundalini rising it stops. How? Because a thought arises, falls down and a thought arises, falls down. It's a continuous thing and we are mostly jumping on the cusps of these thoughts. Now when the Kundalini rises, she elongates this person. There is a space in between, it's called in Sanskrit, the villain. We can call it pause and when your mind stops at that, you become thoughtlessly aware. You are thoughtless but you are extremely aware and you reach the witness state. You see everything as a witness, just as a witness. Say for example, I see a beautiful carpet. I am very very shy, enamoured and I react with, I say, Oh my God, what a good carpet, how much it must have cost, where can I get it and all that. Supposing it's fine, then I am too worried, I have not yet registered it or issued it, so there is a promise. But supposing I am a realized soul, then I just watch it. I watch it silently and enjoy all the art that is put into it. That's how you learn how to enjoy art. In Sahaja Yoga, all the people who were chartered accountants, never knew anything about music or poetry, have become poets, very great poets. Somebody who never used to sing has started singing, so many things have happened. Apart from that, anything, I must tell you this capital is the tree that you prosper. Because your awareness is so great that you prosper. All of them have prospered. All those Sahaja Yogis who have come to Sahaja Yoga have prospered. Not that you are hankering after money, but money hankers after you. You get prosper. And because your attention is so tight, your attention is so pure, in the light of the Spirit, your attention knows what is destructive for you, what is constructive for you. For example, somebody gets the money, he goes on wasting all this wisdom and getting all the bad qualities that are not needed for your body or for your mind. But supposing he is a realized soul, he gets the money, he says it's possible for some good problems. And that's how he works it out. So the prosperity comes and joy. Joy is singular, it is not happiness, it is happiness. Just if you feel joyous, you feel so joyous and happy and you don't hurt anybody, that is not your job. You just enjoy your compassion, your love, your confidence. So this is what, when Meemee has produced this thing, for expression of her love, you have become a doctor. For her compassion, you have become a doctor. But now the ideology has changed. That's what has to do with you. Enjoy it during the day. I mean I'm not taking anybody to these doctors, neither. They are trying anybody from the doctors, patients. But the enjoyment of the curing is so great, much greater than all the best people. And that's how you get. But you don't become poor. There are so many ways in your health because I said this Divine Power is also very important. Doctor's thing, I can tell you, he, when he joined Sahaja Yoga and then he was in it, suddenly he got a very, very big job, very big job in India. How he got it and how he got it. And very happy. That's how you understand how to have your beautiful family, how to have your beautiful relationships with each other, how to lead a very beautiful life and make a beautiful country. Such people are needed today. Such happy, joyous, peaceful and loving people we need. And that you get, for that you don't have to suffer in any way. Don't have to suffer. You enjoy. For curing others you don't suffer. You really enjoy every thing. So I wish you all the best of God. Please. If you can, if you want to have self-realization, we'll work it out. But that's not the end of it. You have to attend our centers. No money in it. You can't pay any money. This is one thing you should know. I mean in this country you could try to accept me because I was not giving any money. Can you believe that? They say, there are no rose-fries, I know. I only work on my uncle and I have nothing. Then you are in the business, no, I'm not. Then we don't want it. This attitude has been changed. What will they all fall for? For joy, for happiness, for being good to others. And automatically your heart starts melting and really will be no longer different. Other problems also get solved. You see, there's too much of right side because I'm saying, because you have dropped it. You people all develop right side more than the left side. Another thing which is very dangerous, one can get into, is the same heel going into your head. So you can get palampegia, you can get balance. It's common. It's very, very common. But that's not necessary. I even have very old, much older than all of them. But one thing is there that I'm very active and I never feel tired, never feel tired. It's so enjoyable, the whole thing is, to talk to people about issues and things and some kind of issues. Moreover, it cannot be forced on you. It cannot. You have to ask, why? Because this Kundalini is the pure desire. You know one thing, that our desires are not pure. If they were pure, there would have been no economics. Because you want to have one thing, all right, you get it, then you want to have another thing, you get it, you get it. You are never satisfied. So when this pure desire is said, you get the satisfaction. And that is not there and you enjoy each and everything, each and everything. That's the temperamental duty. Beautiful. Human beings are very beautiful. I think they are little bit lost in the wilderness. And they have to come back to understanding of the truth. Because you get the Absolute Truth, Absolute Truth. If any person comes to Me, and I say, he has been saved, you can verify the Absolute Truth. Anyone who comes, say, from India and tries to cheat, when the guru goes on, you can easily find out if it's true or not. Any other thing, whatever you want to know, it is absolutely knowledge that you can get. We call it as Gyanamaya, Mr. Power of knowledge and the power of absolute knowledge. On your nervous system, it's very, very dynamic, but you are dynamic. It's still, it's still being put away. But let it rise and you will see how dynamic you are, how much you are effective, how much you can go to retirement. Thank you very much. I made it. And I would request people to understand that I cannot force you. It has to be of your desire and soul. I would say, if you don't want to have your Self-realization, then go away. But nothing happens, hardly takes ten minutes for you to reach the heavens. So why not try? There will be no questions, I think. I wonder if you could be specific about what one would expect to see. Does one sit in that position? Does one say a mantra? Does one do physical movement? Does one close one's eyes? I have no idea what I'm talking about. That I will tell you, infinitely. But you don't have to stand here and ask, nothing of the kind. You can't. It's very simple. Wherever you have to go, it's all right. Thank you for asking. Motherji, what would be the effect of diet and posture on meditation? Ahara sahaja yoga, ahara sahaja yoga, ahara sahaja yoga, ahara sahaja yoga. This you can find out. Once you have your realization, you will realize what sort of a personality you are and what sort of food you should have. You see, it is not before that you can just say, all right, you become this, you become that. Once you get your realization, you yourself will realize that what kind of food you should take, what kind of posture you should have. It means that Motherji, certain schools say that the kind of diet that you take, for example fruits and like natural foods which women are agreed in getting, like in meditating properly, there are certain things like say, meat or for that matter or wine, all these do not work properly. That's why you are saying that you are not like that. It's not like that. It's not like that. It's a very analytical because say for example, I would say in general in India people should eat meat because they are so big, their muscles are so big. But say in the European countries they should eat less meat because they are quite muscular, I think they are sometimes. For a liver patient, there is balance of the kind. It depends on the personality. Thank you. First I was saying in Marathi and then I was saying in English. I was saying in Marathi and then I was saying in English. My son is autistic and he has a very low mental IQ. So how can I treat him? How can I explain him? How can he do the yoga? How can I explain him? He is a very good person. He is a very good person. He is a very good person. He is a very good person. He can be cured. He can be cured. He can be cured. He can be cured. He can be cured. Where is your meditation class and how can we get there? You have to come and you will be seized. You can try and you don't have to pay. You bring that son there of Charu Charu and you see for yourself. I am just telling her, she is talking about somebody who is 29 years of age and he can't even say it. So I said, all right, you get your realization. You understand and you can cure it. Also these people can go and do it. Not that people will not. But she can do it herself. We have no hospital here, nothing. Actually I wanted one of these doctors to come and stay here and tell you about Sahaja Yoga. Who has the means of Adam and Eve, so no problem. But if somebody could be employed or something, he could come here. That was my suggestion. Thank you. I have a question. Dr. Dallai, you do funny ones, don't you think? Yes? Dr. Dallai, you do funny questions, don't you? Well, it depends on your son. Anyway, this is also your yoga. So you are dealing with the Kundalini aspect of the yoga. India is everywhere. It's not here, don't say. I'm just saying or not. Okay, my first question is, you are dealing with the Kundalini yoga. That aspect, can we find any one person, any who can join also my experience with you? Yes, all right. That's the point for that. You have to come to our center. We have got, I have a human to find us, not only 50 for books I think. And also we have written about medicine, you can come and get it, they will help you. But you have to come there. Yes, I will come there but is there some flyer? You can come to know where are the yoga centers you have here in Maryland. So, can you not see from here? That information will convey to you shortly. Let me do that. Thank you very much. You are so anxious, I'm very happy. But they will do all that and tell you where is the thing. Now, most of them are anxious to get their Self-realization. So you get your Self-realization and then you go to the center also. All right? Thank you. May I make a quick comment? I'm sorry, I just wanted to let you make a comment. May I make a quick comment? I'm just trying to tell you that I have, I myself have worked with the eight patients that you mentioned and they want to come back to the meetings and they do the same meditation themselves. They have been treating themselves. Okay? Like this. Bending and bending. All these things you can ask is the letter. Why don't ask there? Why people are waiting to get their Self-realization, isn't it? So just respect that. You have to respect them, respect ourselves also. Is that what I'm saying? I think, by the time they are fully available, they are coming to me. It's common. I'm not sure. All right. Now everybody must sit down. That's important. You should be relaxed. You all should be relaxed. Now one half of you have to ask is to take out your shoes because it's not an earth itself but we eat them. I hope you don't mind. Okay. There's no need to sit on the ground or anything. Be gentle in your curiosity, okay? That's the problem. All right. Please put both your hands towards Me. Just like this. Simple like this. If they are on your lap, also all right. You shall make a good feeling out of it. Now, as a very outside, I have to ask you one thing. That you should not feel guilty at all for anything. I'm catching this figure. That means there are people who are feeling guilty. See, whatever has happened in the past is past. It's finished. And the future doesn't exist. You have to be in the present. And so please don't feel guilty. If something has been done wrong, all right, so what? At this moment, at least you should not be guilty. It's a wrong thing to feel guilty and kill yourself. That has happened. I don't know why, in the West they have done nothing. Nothing wrong. If they were guilty, they would have been in jail. It's a common fashion to feel guilty also. Indians will never feel guilty, somehow. They don't know how to fight for his feeling. And then another theory is that you have to forgive others. Forgive others. You may say that Mother, it's very difficult to forgive others. You may say that. But what I would say logically, whether you are forgiving or not forgiving, you are doing nothing. What are you doing? By not forgiving, only you torture yourself. So forgive. Forgive everyone and forgive yourself. That's a very important thing and it has such a tremendous power. So I request you to forgive yourself and forgive others. That's all. That's all you can do. You'll work out, I'm sure. You'll work out. Now how do you forgive? Just to say, Mother, I forgive everyone. That's all. Mother, I forgive myself. Mother, I forgive everyone. You can say that's very simple to say. That's not a mantra or anything but it's a very big thing because it opens the center here which is on the crossing of the optic chalice, which is very constricted and it opens. Like that. So just say that because you could really need has to rise. That's the main thing. Now please put your right hand towards Me and put down your head and see for yourself there's a cool breeze coming out of your head. Just see. Cool or hot breeze coming out of the fontanel bone area. Just see for yourself. You can put your hand up there or on the sides or forward, backward, forward, backward, anywhere you feel like and see for yourself if there's a cool breeze or hot breeze like vibrations coming out. It is hot because you have not forgiven yourself or you have not forgiven others. This must be the reason but let feel that it's coming out of your head is the biggest proof. Now don't doubt it. There's no air conditioning in your head that it is coming out. We must not doubt it. So lay it little bit. Lay it little bit. Not in front. Take it on the fontanel bone area which was the soft bone in our childhood. Now please now put the left hand towards Me and bend your head and see with the right hand now, see for yourself there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head. Have faith in yourself. That's the main thing. You all can get realization and you can become all self-realized also. Just like saying Sufis. Now put your right hand towards Me and left hand again on the fontanel bone area. You can move your hand and see for yourself if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head. Now after this please put both your hands towards Me and bend your head. And don't think. Just don't think. Don't think. Just don't think. Have your hands fully open like this and don't think. All those who have felt cool or hot breeze on the fingertips or on the palm or on top of your head, out of the fontanel bone area, please raise your hands. Oh My God! Thank you very much. So many of you, wow! Now only I have a very humble request is that you must attend to myself. Please attend to ourselves. I am trying to master this out. You can. This power is delivering you heat. It's coming out of your fontanel bone area. And it is there. It's so great and worth it no matter. So I would request you to please go to our center and mark me. And you will see how many wonders you can do. This was yours so far. Again I thank you very much, all of you and your history. You are so kind. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

This is very beautiful. The last time I checked it was on YouTube. Shh, shh. Shh. I'm not going for the wedding round. I will, but... I'm sorry, sir. Ah, thank you. I'm not going to leave you for a long time. And you're going to be oppressed. Shh. They should write in English because I can't read. Still I'm not sure. Shri Mataji, when the Indian teacher says something, you will be in trouble. Shh. I'll try to not repeat it. Shri Mataji, when the Indian teacher says something, you will be in trouble. Shri Mataji, in English. My heart is so cold, I don't know. Because maybe I'll be a city legend and live with my own family. Shri Mataji says that your heart is like joy. It's like the heart is like your own family. Thank you. You know what? What is also good is nothing but compassion. Because all yoga is a way of constantly becoming more and more compassionate. And if you have any pain against someone, just try to forgive. For getting it, you will forgive and you will be in relief. This is the kind of cure that helps you to be more and more compassionate. The best thing is to be able to give up and to be more compassionate. Because you feel very pure in the heart. There are so many things in me that I can't forgive. I'm just a friend of my heart. I am also a believer in Shri Mataji's benefits with all your support. I chose to come quickly because I did feel alive. I'm alive. I decided to come to Italy because I want to receive the love and the love of Italy. The joy that you are experiencing is really between the two of us. The joy that you are experiencing is really between the two of us. Because more is needed to get the realization of the other. And more is needed to be profounder between the two of us. And you will know your sense and you will know everything. And with all your heart and with all your heart and everything. Because yoga is the only way by which to become your Self. When you become your Self, then only you can know who's as well as your Self to be with you. This is what is very important. That you should know yourself. It is easy to know what's a problem you are trying to deal with. Also you will know how much you love the man. And you can cleanse yourself. But when you give realization, you can cleanse yourself. But when you give realization, you can cleanse yourself. And you can cleanse yourself. And as I told you, that means you need more sedition. You have to be creative. And what is the benefit of creating more sedition? And also you will get other creative powers. And you will get other creative powers. The whole of Europe, which I guess are the most creative. Because in all Europe Italians are more creative. The great senior San Giorgio is present here in the International Center. He is the senior San Giorgio. But nowadays I find that we are the most mechanical. Now the rural comment seems to be triangle. This is verywe Shareg week against vacation. I'll remove it, take two minutes to talk about it. Then it is time to aftervaccinate. Okay fine, we took colour amazing results to teach the other and the other. So you are willing to do your art, your expression of life? Through art, through our heart, through love and compassion. Then only you will have satisfaction of life. And only we will have satisfaction of life. It's such a beautiful thing to see so many people here in such a beautiful state of device, a vision state of device. You have visited Europe three times, in the last year and a half, the final tour of Europe was in the spring of 2020. It is beautiful to see that many people have been given this status of connection with the individual. The life that we have been given here, no doubt, but also knowledge, absolute knowledge. We have lived through joy and comfort, but we have become very close. For this you should really do something in finance or anything. And to answer this, I don't know if you have ever tried to do a type of penitence or austerity. It's introspection. It's only introspection. I will see what's wrong with you. It seems that something is not going to go through you. Then you can select yourself very easily. Whatever works the fastest, whatever you do the best.

Good-bye. Good-bye. Good-bye. Good-bye. Good-bye. Good-bye. Good-bye. Good-bye. Good-bye. Good-bye. Good-bye. Good-bye. I don't know what to say after all this but I think you are all sitting in a big darbar sitting and the way he is playing there you must see his presence of mind what surprises Me. He never repeats and the presence of mind of suddenly taking to a new theme, suddenly taking to a new turning point is really very, very remarkable. But I think he got lost in his meditation also. And the depth of that has brought the voluminousness, the grandeur of darbari, grandeur of darbari. Like in the deep sea if you go you will find lots of precious stones like that he found out on his depth and all that has come out. Something so unique a treat and we all should give him a big hand for that. Good-bye. Twelve o'clock in India is not the same when he was born. At least two and a half hours more when he will be born. That day. But you see the beauty is that when you are say erecting a big palace you have lot of time and you can plan it out and then you start seeing things and you start working it out where to put what. But in a raga like darbari the way fast he was going on every minute he was putting a new pattern, a new design, a new color. It was really remarkable because I know something about architecture and without even seeing it what is to be done he was just working it out, such a beautiful painting you can call it, a four dimensional painting it was. And I was amazed at it the way he was using every moment to change the whole picture which is very remarkable, very, very remarkable. And the time was so short but the depth was such that in the depth he would just jump into the depth and change over to a new pattern and again bring out some new diamonds and new rubies and pearls like that. It was tremendous I must say, it's very beautiful it was. And as it is this raga is like an ocean of Swaraj, you can feel it, the whole as the ocean you know we are now near the ocean like that. It's a very enormous, enormous atmosphere it is, enormous, enormity within ourselves. The enormity is created and you start feeling yourself an enormous personality is it. So it gives you a kind of a dignity and a kind of a weight, what we call the Guruthva. You get that Guruthva within yourself. How you should produce a sound and how you should talk, how you should sit, how you should walk, as we say Gajagamini like a, and like a majestic walk of an elephant you see the whole thing was moving so beautifully. But the elephant can't move so fast also but this gentleman was moving the elephant so very fast and the trunk was going round and the tail was moving and the whole thing was so beautifully done and all these little, little movements also built up there. It's like making a beautiful pattern in a big palace and it's such a short time. The whole thing was so beautiful. May God bless you all. May God bless you all. May God bless you all. May God bless you all. May God bless you all. What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that? What's that?

The raag is jingoti. It is with my limited knowledge. It is basically a raag for the instrumentalists. But for Ustad, there is nothing that is restrictive. Whether it is strictly for the instrument or strictly for the vocalist. These are for people who are aspiring to become masters. It is... No, I was saying, Swadhanji, those who are aspiring to become masters, for them it is difficult. A master has already achieved this stage whether it is purely for an instrument or whether it is purely for a vocalist, it makes no difference. And you will see both the aspects, I am sure, as to what we call as the gaikis style, that is the singing style and the vocalist style. And you will also see the style of the tantra, that is the instrument, that is purely instrumental style. But there is a very happy blending of the two, I am sure, in this great versatile artist. Sorry if I have said something wrong, I would end my apologies. You have said more than I can do. I am sure... Next time I have to put a curtain here before I play. I assure you, he is showing the qualities of Hanumananda who never knew what his worth and what his capacity is. He is a very humble person, is what I would say. My sister would never certify anybody like that, but for him she said that he is one of the most humble artists I have come up with. See, in the truth, you see, the truth, and a little tuning goes on, whether it is a tabla or a star or anything, immediately they must correct it, even if there are other people's teeth, is not regarded as bad manners. But in the West I have seen, once they start playing, they go on playing, whether it is out of tune or not, just won't play. Because every instrument can, you see, can lose its shape, can come down, it can happen to every instrument. But in India nobody feels funny about it. But in the West it is so formal that I have learned so many times over the after hours and sometimes I have to feel it going so out of tune, instrument, but still he was continuing with it.

Clear a space in a whole circle there. It's all the time on My head. You have it for a short time. Imagine. I have it all the time on My head. Come here. Go on, shut all that. You have to learn from Me. I never complain. Though it's quite rich, you can imagine how terrible it is. See, they have like their cloths very well. I love the teacups. Some of you can sit this side, yes. Sit on this, don't sit on this. You can have something spread there, I think. Shri Mataji, Anand from Fiji has composed the song and he wants to sing it to you. All right, thank you. Before they start the dancing, if he could just sing to you. I think you come this side. Quickly, just play the lights down. Perhaps you'd like to sit over there. With the mike. Oh, I see. You're right. Come and do it here. Sit over there facing the mike this way. Don't you have some colored paper that will look nice for the dancing girls? If you have any colored papers? You can call it the silicone now. Silhoupe. Give him the mike. Writing's not that good. Get ready to speak. Do it on the panel, please. I'm going to sing the song. Shri Mataji. Atma jnana mukodena.

Yourelling and is Your spirit eighteen of windows and flourish as Love it on Thy 69th.

So now we'll have the dancing. If you people move a little bit this side, then dancing girls can come easily, come forward. You sit in front of her. Here you can come and sit here, all right? I think you better close the sides because it's very cold I think for people that side. You may close the outsides. That will not give such a big, yes, see now, when they are dancing if you put it, see this, put it in front, see the colors will change. No? This side, make it double. Color, it won't be so much shining there. Yes, when they, when your face is showing red, looks nice. Yes, give one there, one there and one here, you see. Make it fourfold. So when they dance, you see, the face will be showing reddish. It won't be such a thing on the face. Yes, you may change it later on if you want. Let them come. It's here, somebody has it, my spectacles, Modi? Almost. Much more soothing, isn't it, this way? It doesn't give such a light, better. What's happening? The elevator not working? Oh, it's burning. Just throw it out. Just take it out. Leave it. That one also. I don't know what you did. You should not touch. That's the problem. Keep it away from it. You see, then it's just above that. You see, just hold it, yes. On top of that you could have done it. It is, hold it, just hold it. When they dance then hold it, that's all. No, that's very open one, you see, that's why. It has no cover also. But you can hold it when they start dancing. Don't tie it up. Stand from front, not from near, yes, that's better. Just hold it, it's better for a while. That's it. Give it a bandhan. I wanted to have the picture of the children dancing. Bandhan works. Now again, it's all right. It's very nice, the colors are, see, it's all red. Except for Me everybody is looking red, I don't know what's the matter. Come along now. All right, the music has started. Very good. Who has taught them? Very tight. They have the lilt of it.

Mother, I might go and ring Steven in Adelaide and find out about the... No, I might ring Steven in Adelaide now and find out the time of the interview for tomorrow. The radio interview in Adelaide tomorrow, I will ring Steven now and find out what time it is. I will ring Steven now and find out what time it is. He's on the telephone now, he's ringing from bank on the telephone. He must have tried because we have changed our program now. PG is creating a conflict now. It's such a funny situation, big drama. I don't think this fellow will continue like that. But PG's, Indians cannot buy land there, that's the constitution. They cannot purchase a land. Yes, they have to go into business, they have to be in business to make money. Now he wants to start a new style of fire. You can sit down and eat the part of the chicken. No, you can't eat the part. You can eat the part of the chicken. No, you can't eat the part of the chicken. You can eat the part of the chicken. So, they now he's trying to form a new constitution. But that's not democratic, is that it? PG Islands. But Indians did not want to kill everything when they circled out here. I'm not sure of the history, Mellon. They were invited to come and help with the economy. But the constitution was made such a way that they come on land. I see. That creates trouble. There is all the time tension between the Fijians and Indians. Indians are very clever. They'll not kill anybody, but they don't do it. But they'll increase their population. They'll increase their population and win the elections. And a kind of a balanced life, you see. So, even in England, Indians are not religious people. In England, why this problem? Because they are balanced life, they don't bring their own good families, children get education, they are doing business. Where it is, they are very religious. Most of the Indians in England have got, um, uh, mercy rates. Most of them. And they don't take drugs. They don't find drug business. That below their degree should take a drug. How do they manage to do so well, Mum? How do they manage to do so well? It's just, first of all, the people who are gone there, have gone there to die of making money. So the whole family goes. They have day and night shops. The whole family goes. Day and night. They're so open. And now imagine, they are producing things in England, in the, in the culture. Many things which were never produced in England. These are all things are selling. They are very industrious people. They have got to make money. And they don't have any business. They work very hard. I went to one place called Trolley. And I saw some houses there. Very nicely done and all. So they said, these are the houses of Indians, I said. I said, England. At the English house, they were, he loves it. He clearly bathed the other person. So I said, what do you mean? Why the English? He said, they divorce their wives. Then I have another wife. Then another wife. Then why don't you talk? So then I have busy with the boys and the children are running away. And they, so there's no home like this. You see, somebody is owning the house today. Somebody, tomorrow has to sell the house for the wife will divorce and all. So this is the condition of the place. So I said, then what is the situation between you and English? They said, no, no, we are, they are daggers and with us. They don't like us. They are very jealous. They see our children being educated as architects, doctors. They don't like us. But I really saw it and I was surprised. You could make them out very lousy, absent, sexy. I think they must have their drinks in the night. They must go to the pub, water, money, they earn gold in all these things. This is the curse. And then Indians tried to copy the books which also have English. I do many things. So best I saw was this, that went to a Sikh's place. And as we climbed up, they had made a complete pub in his house. They took a look at the pub. I was shocked. I said, what's this? He said, pubber? She said, call it pubber. He's in my pub, he said. He took out the water, he showed me how the soda comes out of the mouth. So then I said, do you sell it here or what? They said, no, no, no, this is for our family. I said, do you drink? No, no, we don't drink. But those two girls should drink, we cannot have that. We make a drink, drink things like that, the whole pub over there. Mother, you were telling us a story about the lady with the pine furniture and she... Ah, pine furniture. She, we took a house on rent. So I didn't know my husband was busy. Even there, he saw the house, he liked it and took it. Then he said that there's a lady, his wife, she's like a vampire. I said, what's she doing? She's a very thin woman, she is very absolutely skeleton and she has very, some sort of a blouse which was quite transparent and I didn't know where to do. And this woman came in and she's a very, very hot tempered woman. She said, see, now this is my furniture. We are not to remove it, even an inch if you remove, I'm going to remove it. It should be, we are not to remove my curtains. He said, see how these curtains my wife won't like, I tell you to be very frank. They are very thin, you know, we can't remove them. I'm sorry but you see, no, no, no, you can't remove the curtains and this and that. So he was quite frightened of her, he said, for buying this house to be now out to manage. I said, why are you afraid of her? So what you tell her off? That no, we will not do these things. He said, no, no, you know now, you cannot tell her, now we are under contract, is that I said all that. So what happened then? After eight days, I found a lot, what you call dry lot, in that furniture. So then all the junky pine furniture, I don't know, there's a fashion nowadays to have all the junky pine, you know, supposed to be very fashionable. Any good cheap is fashionable, isn't it? So it was there. And we were both our very heavy people, so we were afraid to ever sit on them. We didn't know what to do and she wouldn't allow us to bring our comfortableness furniture, instead we were like, we didn't know what to do. So I said, now you sit on the ground all the time, what to do now? There's so much afraid of us. So this thing dry lot appeared. And suddenly in all her furniture, I discovered dry lot. So we found that, I see there is dry lot in your furniture, we don't want to keep this furniture in the house, because all your boards are already cracking and they have got, if they get into that then your house will be finished and this, she got a fright. She said, all right, put my furniture in the, in the garage and you can bring your furniture. I said, but we not bring our furniture, which is your furniture there. Then only you can put all my furniture there. And this was treated by somebody, so I asked Antonio, treat it. So removed all the furniture, we brought our furniture there. So when my grandchildren came, you see, they said, but grandfather told us that it's a very witty, horrible furniture that you have to live with. Where is that? She said, no, no, that's all gone in the garage, because there was dry lot. So she just laughed. So she asked me, Nani, what did you do? She said, no, she said, please. So that was the thing. But now there was a tree which was just shangin' on the date. And there was no car to pass through that disease. So we had to cut that part of the thing. And they would ask her, and then he cut it. Then she said she was, she told her husband, you see, I don't know what's her husband said, my wife is crying for the tree that was cut. Not the tree, a branch is cut for that. She's just weeping for it. I don't know what to do. So you better make some sort of a compensation. So then I took CT, you tell her that money cannot come bring back the tree in any case. And we give it up to her saying whatever she said, no, so we have done it. And nothing of the kind. We are not going to compensate. And CT is a quite a big lawyer, you see, now he got corrected. He said she should compensate for giving us dry lot for nature. I said, Nani, so many horrible things to us. Then he said all these things. I said, see now, you should be afraid of people who are sick and never be afraid of nasty people. You must face them up and you must tell them. You see, because nasty people are cowards, they're cowards. If you stand up and fix that, they're not. Thank you. Good people should never be afraid of nasty people. I don't like to be afraid. And that's how we put the right crowd. She was absolutely non-trust and cheating on. We told her in and of that you come and see your things, all things are there, just see for yourself, and now we are shifted to another house. Because now we'll be 15 from London, so you won't take a house permanently, or you'll tell it off. So we've gone on to this. She's a South Korean lady, married to an Englishman. The Englishman as a husband is a cabbage, absolute cabbage. She always looks at her and says, what she has to say, whatever she says happens. I always say, Englishmen are the punk cabinet, just because they're boys. Basically, there are two tight slaps sometimes. The English women are also, sometimes are so dominated, sometimes so dominated. So she has picked up from somewhere, she's American I think, that is in America. But now things are working out better. You have some very good ladies, English ladies, very decent girls, and now things are working out better. But in the beginning I found some of the ladies who are so dominated, very dominated. Lots of imbalances. The Sahaja Yogi hospitality is same everywhere. The Sahaja Yogi hospitality, moment we've come here, given us something to eat. The moment we arrived, we begin with eating. They're also... No, I say, Baba, I just traveling, traveling means too much. But now you'll find out what is the situation here about you. When I came to Canberra also, I couldn't hear for the whole day. Not for the whole day. Then it was all right. Again this long travel, this is some trouble. The whole thing bothers me very hard to see. After you left us, Michael, you know, where do we go to all this? Yes, we heard. We sat in the airport for two hours also, upstairs. We were upstairs for two hours. Because James left on a later flight, Mother. And so we waited with him until his flight left. And it was about two hours after. John, back to Sydney, Mother. Why is he? That's what I said, one often you can rest for a while, then another half now. So the people from Hong Kong wanted to see me in Singapore. So I said, maybe in Singapore I might not have so much time. They are all the way to Hong Kong. So I said, they have to stop at Hong Kong to see me. Yes, what's it all right? Yes, it is, Mother. All your interviews are on Tuesday. Nothing tomorrow. Ten o'clock, ten o'clock on Tuesday, and half past one on Tuesday. So why did they have your supply list? Come to my bar, go to their... Our desire, Mother. Actually, the Irish people wanted me there. Who is the father of the Irish, the last one? Lawrence Castle, Lolita's husband. Lolita? The Indian girl, Lolita. Lolita? The doctor. How is she? She's much better, much better. He came from Nepal? Yes. I don't know. It's remarkable how people come inside of that. We have really lots of stories to be written about, sir, just for us present. From every country and every way of life, Mother. From every country and every way of life, the children have come. I mean, everyone can write individually, collectively, so many things happen and how it works out. How it works out. Are you starting a publishing company or something here? Yes, Mother. They have already started one called Margarita in Italy. No, no, not Italy. In Switzerland, where they want to publish my books through that Margarita. The name of baby is Margarita in the French language. So they have called it Margarita. And it's already been registered and all that and they are writing. And I don't know when the books will be ready. But I don't know if these books can be understood by non-realized people. I've gone into details of all the chakras and all those things there. Quite a lot. I just don't know. It's custom like the book for you, Mother. He said this would be a good book for you. And my lectures also will be edited and there will be published with it. And today, the man who was serving was the person. He called me Mother. Have you surprised? Yes. In fact, I wanted to ask him, how did you know she is Mother? Then I felt maybe insulting. I don't know. Robert is in quarters. Robert is in quarters? Yes. Robert tells you that he is concerned with you. So skinny, Mother. So skinny. Where is he now? Sydney. I hope to see him there. His wife is gone or she is still there? I think she was going this week, early this week coming. I was going to talk to Gildor about it because I haven't yet told him. So I have to tell him at first. Otherwise, you see, it will be acceptable there. Yes. The children are going or staying? Weed, stainless and before, when I return, she will be there still. Yes, yes, I think so. I think he vitrically aims that. To hold her. I have to talk to Gildor about her in any case and tell her what is the position is. And then I have to see her and tell her. Because after all you see Gildor also has all these pressures, more funny women and things like that. It is too much funny. But I think there is a, they have to have the same problem with the primary schools for that. I don't know. I think they trained asalapajna. Primary school mother and teacher must be trained. Not traditionally. Sir? Yes. If anyone is in the class, then any teacher is welcome. If you see, Nagaraya Deputy Director of Education is our man. So there is no deputy. And in the meanwhile the person can... Anyone who is a... He is a graduate. What is the name of the house? It is made of Indian style chaat. What is the name? Masala or Sardar? Thai chaat. Hello, Kheer. Hello Kheer. Hello Kheer is done. Today is the end of the school. What is the name of the game? Kheela and Kheera. Kheela and Kheera. Kheela and Kheera. Kheela, Kheera, same. You can eat anything you want. You can eat anything you want. I went there and the kind of work they do on porcelain, I really tell you, with a small little brush. Have you seen that kind of work here? No mother. I have got one little wooden piece. That is called Kaliya pe. And this was a trance. One round, all these things can sit out. That's something. It's something like this. I think they do that kind of work here a little bit. Because the one you have given here is a present. It can sit there. But this is something so beautiful. Savitaja Mola Takkotapara. Savitaja Mola Takkotapara. That. They speak little. Savitaja Mola Takkotapara. The photo. Just a little picture. But I have it. So I want to take this picture. Oh, beautiful. Beautiful. Just like a moon. Such a beautiful child. They say there is a little group here coming up to the right. That picture. Right, they can. Who says a little born child, born, born? Absolutely. You must be hard to say. His eyes are shining. The mother and father, both have said you will be. In between, they will see that. Ma Shahi, is it? Is it? It's here. That's an order. They said it will be right coming up from there. Very small. Very small. But I have to say, they can take it off. They look quite normal. We just want to bring what it meant. The life's soul will be taken. What's the meaning here? It's like a moon. His eyes are shining. Oh, absolutely. Absolutely alert. Calling Ananda Chandran. Ananda Chandran. It's a moon of joy. Thank you, Chandran. Also, it's my grandson's name. Ananda Chandran. Ananda Chandran. She's like, she's my best friend. I was telling my mother. Don't write it down before you know it. That's why, for one thing, that I have to give the name to Savita's dad. She told me that, you have to give the name. I said, all right, let the baby be born. She messaged you? We took the baby and she was admitted to hospital on the way back from the airport after seeing you off. I think she was very anxious that she should be with me when I'm here. Absolutely. This is another miracle story about that has come. I don't know if you'll absolutely know. There's a fellow who is a worshipper of Shiva and there's a photograph. There's my photograph, you put it there, you see. So, the light came on my feet here and showed like that Shiva's, just a ninja is the point, or could be the rest of the area. There was, there was, maybe your thing, in his face of the Buddha, he had put my photograph. And imagine what came out here, certainly this light, like a Shiva, my feet. Who is this ninja on the point? He's Bombay. Bombay. He was basically a all kinds of some sort of a, I mean, whatever I am. What are you doing? What are you doing? What's that? Luck. Okay. Okay. You know this, Jerry, who is a, who is a ninja, she's the first one who got this photograph. Cheryl Slade. She's the first level photograph. She's the one. And she said that I don't know if other, your ashram has got it or not. Yes, we have one. You have got it. The one with the light coming down. Yes, we have. So I think only ashram has one. Yes. She said that Indians are writing that we have one. So I don't know who they sent this picture. We have sent this. Yes, we, I know we've got one in Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane. Just somebody tell them that they have to tell it with luggage. There's some people have, there's already some people have them. There's some people bringing. You're going to have a lucky day. That's a good one. You deserve good marriage. They should stay and have a holiday with us, Mother, after the tour. They're going to say tonight. That's what we'll go with you. Whenever you are there. I think it's channel, you know, photography fresh. If you sub-curring, you can go to Basledini for my wedding. That's right. You did? You did? I did in the weekends. This is the one where you will be all the Mother, no? The Be All the Mother is the Mother. It's another one, Mother. This one was used the year before Mother, on the Postress, 1983. This one. And Be All the Mother is 1982. And... 1985. And 87. And 85. And 87. 85? 85 was the same picture. You used it in 85. But it was photographed in... Oh, photographed, I don't know, Mother. Oh, you had done this? Yes. Not sure, Mother. Photographed in here, they used it in 85. But you took a poster, Mother. A poster, the whole Mother, just from there. But I'm sure, I think I was so clear and so understanding, and not doubtful about anything. They wanted to know more about it. Yes. And the young people, that's a very big thing. But here there were also old people about, say, about 50, 60 years in this group that we have. Quite a lot. And quite a lot of young people. Quite a big group. I think from where have they all these sensible, sweet people have come up? But they're good people, isn't it? Yes, yes. And it's really, really happy to see them. Very nice, sweet people. Very good people. Yes. Shri Mataji, would you like a rice from day in film? Or should we... What? Should we set up on... No, no, no. No, no, no. No, no, no. No, no, no. Ah, thank you. No, you don't set up on the day. I mean, I've been working very hard. You better rest now. Otherwise I'll set up for you. I've been working here. This is the money. Yes, this is the money. It's fine. I don't know where it is. It has a black background. Mother, you are coming out of the dark. It's fine. Yes. I look quite dark also. Complexion looks dark. And you asked us to change the black for a light colour because you said you have a light coming from the light, not from the dark. This was black. It was black. It was a night time shot in India, I think. It's beautiful. She's like a mother. The side is not of the clothes. I'm not like that. That's all. I'm a Sahara photographer. He said he's an attitude there, Sahadev Panathik. But I, why I will say it so, have you seen all of you that photograph that is viewed to me by Rajesh as you return to see me? Yes, he has this photograph. It's going around, it doesn't reach you. And because what I've seen is this, that there's something in the photograph, you see, that I've tried to keep it. Now, this time they didn't have any advertisement as such, in the sense that they put a small advertisement in the newspaper. You were thinking in the evening news that you would be advertisement. And the people came and they didn't get on, they were talking to me and then they hurried up. But I think you were late for the evening news. So it was not there. Then also there was this, the mother, the arrangements, nothing worked out. And specially the eaves we, the there one lady came up and she said this will be a brief after two weeks or something. So it was all as if nothing has been in the newspaper much and they were worried. I was telling them it's alright, we'll get the people advertisement as we can bear and all that stuff, that's all I have. But I was amazed so many people were. So I am feeling that it catch something in the face, definitely. Because even in London, when we have programs, just with that advertisement that I am coming, so many people come in the hall that you can't even walk in. But when it comes to sort of what you call other people trying to eat or there, I am workshop or anything, then the number goes up, I can't understand. Now so many people came here, you see again when I come they come to this house. There must be something in the face, that's all. I am sure other ones will. I don't know how can they, I don't know. Which number, which number, which number, which number, which number, which number, which number? Number eight, it's number eight. Number eight. Seven, six, five. Seven, six, five. But it can be raised. Seven, six, five. It can be raised. And seven, six, five. And it can be raised. It's time to... This is something I can't understand that in America also, same thing I mean I am not an American, I am not a music writer or anything. There is something I find in my face, I think, practically from that. Otherwise other people make such advertisements in the films, in this thing, that thing, even in the cinemas, you see that. And so much they do. He groomed my, she is lady groomed my, she is going to some place and she sends at least twelve people ahead of her. And they contact all the big people. And they say, we invite you we will be sitting on the main chair, this, that, all kinds of things. And then they have to tell who are all the people who will be coming. And then they say, what has to be the invitation cards. They spend such a lot of money and then when they are in still you find about fifty, sixty people come to their room. This lady is lady groomed my, is the daughter of that Muttalanda. And she doesn't say she is the daughter of it. She is the lady that she went out. And one son here. Now, she went to my brother's places because he is the high court judge he is sort of this person in the birthday. She went to see him. She saw my photograph. So she said, they sit in my place, he said, yes. How is she here? He said, she is my sister. She ran away. She ran away. That they know they are doing something wrong. Otherwise why should she not have? Yes. No, she in fact said that they have come to the wrong place. She said, yes. One of all disciples, not she herself, but she said, she said, this right, that means you, nothing. Mataji's photograph was there in the hall. And she was sitting there, supposing. That's all it means, picture, photograph. It was good. I don't think she can open it. Please, don't do this. You have to just, you see, lift it, then it opens. All the girls like to enjoy their little children, right? Don't be very dulls. She is a good dancer, I must say. Her dancing is very good. She is learning here the dancing? Yes. Where is the school here? Come up and tell Mother. That's all. What is your school here? I don't know, Mother. It's in Melbourne, it's in the suburb of Melbourne. Who is the teacher? She's called Shanti. Shanti? And you have to, she has records. She plays the records and teaches you all records. Sometimes she has loud music. She has? Some people have it played on the New York dance. We haven't done it yet, haven't we? She's so talented, she's very talented. She's our one here too. Just use that one of my tips. I don't want to get lost in it. Oh, oh, oh, oh. She learns, but it's not good. And it's very difficult, Mother, for the western girls to know all these movements. You see the feet like this, and to dance. Yes. My doctors used to do that. They learned all that and they were understand also. But then they grew very tall, so they first started feeling shy. Such a lot of money is to be spent on their dress and everything, you know, the whole thing is quite expensive. So, let's say you provide with the dress and all that, or you have to get your own. Oh, I'm lucky because I can get all the hand down. And also we made the hair, the hair fix. And the dress, the solid thing that you are wearing. We got that from India. We got that from India. We got that from India. We got that from India. We got that from India. We got that from India. Good. They have a school here to teach parathas. Yes. In Mirabar? Yes. I think it's better to learn Bharat, this of Kathar. It's better dancing. Because what happens is that Saati and Nanji, or you have to have all the things together. But there's no Kathar dancing here, is it? There's no Kathar dancing. What style do you learn, Mishra? Paranacham. This is Marath Man. This is the difficult one. Difficult in the sense you must have a a singer. Then you must have a violinist. Then you must have a percussionist. But Kathar also... Kathar is also a tabla. Tabla. Tabla, the beauty of tabla is in Kathar. You have seen the Kathar dancing these boys must have sent you some from what? They have done. You did some Kathar dancing in the recording. So what? You didn't send them any? No. Because they don't know the things, you must send them. They are some of the good ideas. So who would you like to see? You haven't got any films you do here. No. None? None. None of these were the mainly style of music and all that. I also want to talk about this in my birthday. We weren't there then. But maybe you sang very beautifully in my birthday in the wrong way. You were not at your birthday. What? You weren't at your birthday? Ah, you were at your birthday. Rajesh made it. Is it all I thought? What's that? Can we afford you a dress? I was thinking that some music don't have any happy. I was thinking that some music don't have any happy. I was thinking that some music don't have any happy. I want to also be happier. I want to also be happier. Stop talking in a sense. Have you, you have got any music you got? No. You have got music you have got? No. Every time I must tell you all that you must be to some music. We have music. We'll just have to put it on to the side. Let's see before you know. No, not with us. We will do it in future. Must always have. It's very important. I don't know if there is any difference. Okay, I will just come. What's going to happen? No, no, the suitcase is broken. But you can tell us like Ram. There is a piece of rope. There is a piece of rope. There is a piece of rope and it's in there. It's in there. It's all under here. I will just have to take it. That it's a little bit. It's all over. You can tell us. I'll have to tell you. I'll have to tell you. So, how do you like it? Beautiful. This was the bad jams in Sydney, mother. She said to one better thing. How beautiful they are. Oh, yes. Thank you. Very important. Yes, they were for the Shuddy Camps boys. Were they? The elephants? The elephants? Oh, that's all. Beautiful elephants there at your feet, mother. Very much beautiful. Yes. Shuddy Camps people. This one has take the graph. That's a good photograph. I appreciate it. This one is. Go India. It's a travel poster. No, I see it. No, I see it. This one is in the office. Yes. I think you were talking to Mr. Saitay. Lilliana, call the dentist. Just have a look. Okay, mother. I'll call the dentist. Just see this. Just see this. See. How about the body? The master piece. It's a master piece. Beautiful. I don't know how they achieve it in the point. I think they put the brush and then remove the rest of the thing with the another little brush for us. Krishna was saying that they use a hair brush. They use it for about 50 years of age. And her husband at this late age has removed us. But look at this is the beauty. Such a beauty. And after Sahaja Yoga she started doing it so well. They use hair brush. This one we're going to get blown up to take just where you are in white with a little bit of dark at the back and had it blown up as a process. It's something I wish it blows. Looks like an engineer. It looks like the cool breeze has taken the shore away. I didn't know I could be cool like that. Not with the sand. It's very beautiful. Very beautiful the back. Rajesh took the man. Very satisfied. Very satisfied. Is Rajesh did this one? Yes he did. He took all. That's wonderful. And this one was a pure color. Something went to that. One better idea. Very nice. Beautiful. I'll say beautiful. Beautiful. The colors mother are so beautiful. What do you think of me? Very satisfied. We looked at these and Rajesh said they would be wonderful for three photos like this. So I'm going to get big ones for Rajesh and send them to him in India. Just beautiful. Colors are beautiful. Can you change the background? Just see that. Can you? It's absolutely a masterpiece in nature. Doesn't look like personite. What's that? Doesn't look like personite. Painting. Painting, yes. But he's painting now. But what of painting now? After we had our mission she said she would do this one. Of course. Mother, David Spiro has just run on the telephone. And with your permission he'll ring back in ten minutes to talk about shooting camps. You have to talk to the gentleman. In ten minutes. You want to talk to him? Yes. They are still going around. He's invited us for the photograph. Right, first. This is one of the things one can show after Sahaja Yoga. How can we get to art? This is an old woman, imagine. You two have done marvels throughout the world. We're also but I must say this is something remarkable. Did she used to paint before Sahaja Yoga, mother? She used to do a little bit, not much. But this kind of work she started after Sahaja Yoga. She lives in a village because she's a farmer's wife. Her husband has been a rocker. So she just makes these things and such and such. And also she makes some dolls she's just having it. Thank you. Michael. I would like to have a copy of this. You may have that one. This one. Please do it. Alright. You can't remember, see that one. Have a look through the photos here. Come on, how many? Where does that come? Because I have the negative. You select it right. I have the negative. I can make some. Where's the negative? That's right. Come on, how many? It's a bit of a big one, isn't it? She must have very good eyes, too, too. And she doesn't have a good eye. You see, Michael. You see. You can see, Michael. Now, you two things have come to see. There's this there's a school for Marathakya in India also for Marathakya. She wants to go there. But we are ourselves thinking of starting a school of Bharata Kya and Kathar and all that in Kulpatipur. We have got the land, so we want to start something, where we can all advertise all over and get people there for that. And if people want to learn those 21 hours, we have decided. On 21 hours and we get 20 teachers there and we can choose seven out of them. I have to be there for six months. For six months they have to stay there. And then we can, I mean, we don't quite a lot of the six months, because without six months you can't learn. And the six months, because three months it's a very big rainy time and three months some attack. So when you go six months, six months will be the primary time for them. That is one. And the another is Vaitana school, which you are going to have for children from abroad. But that, now if you have a problem with primary school, you can start a primary school also. But seven year old child, the other three, they'll look out into your water. But that's also the time when they must begin Kathak. If they want to learn Kathak, they must begin now. Then only. That's seven. Have you seen Kathakal Singh? We have seen of Mr. Pallas. He's a great exponent. He's a great exponent. Both his wife and him. If you were saying he can come to Ganpati Purae to do the dancing for us, he was quite anxious. Let us see. These artists become very sort of busy when they go to the West, because some they go to this country, that country, all the time programs are there and stuff. But if you can get three, four times in Ganpati Purae, it will be a good idea. And you see, it should come for a day. Madras is the place for Farhat Natya. You have to study between Madras and Madras. Here we don't have a very good Sahaja yogi, or anything. We have very good Sahaja yogis there. Very good Sahaja yogi. Mr. Murti is a very nice man. You must have met him. Yes, I did. He's a very loud house and he makes good chocolates. He's a very good chocolate seller. Is that tall person? Tall person. He's very good. And such a fatherly person, very nice man. You have met some very nice people in Madras, very good search. One is Jainthar, Mr. Murti, that Mr. Murti's one niece is there. He's another very good girl. But it's also a place where many horrible gurus like Satya Sai Baba and all these have come down. And that has created such a problem. Because his own brother became mad with that. None of the body lost all his money because Sai Baba wanted him to make one thing. And he inaugurated the film and all that. And the whole thing has gone to waste. All that money is for it. There are so many criminal cases pending against him. Just a few months. In Madras. And here all the angels are after that. We should really publish the action. It is published. Despite of that people are changing the radio very fast. Is it published? Yes, yes. One of the magazines which believes in rationalism published all his life. So what do you think of the artistic talent of the living? Superb, isn't it? Superb, no doubt. I mean an artist can understand it better than any human being. Very, very subtle colours. Such a colour says, what theme lines? The mark of a man. Where is she from, Mother? She is from New Zealand. But she is an aunt of this chalry. Have you met her sometimes? She is the one who gives my photograph which has got this Dhammamana hair. She is her aunt. And then her husband suddenly left her for nothing at all for some other woman as well. So she said, alright, it doesn't matter. She took to Sahaja Yoga. And she used to paint a little bit. But this all is here, then after realizing it. Am I missing in modern times and imaginary? Isn't it in modern times who can do like that? But what she does, I think, also that she was telling me that she paints the whole thing and then with a smaller brush she takes out the paint and spreads it on the sides. She will make it thin. That's the very difficult task I must say. If you have any of the brush you go on. She has nothing there. Also there should be a piece of her, feel the kind of work you are doing in which gold rims are there, only the gold rims way. From town up or like that, gold rims. You know, big, contiguous, some sort of a gold like that. So it's like a Kundalini I felt, the fate you are going in a spiral way. I share no guidance of each and every. I must show you one more thing nice I can't bear to see that. So the brush talk about, I have pet her, where's my coat? Let's see, see, where the coat is there. Really they are very artistic people. Because they are, I think farmers. Because they are farmers they do this artistic job, very artistic. And out of the palm tree, can you imagine, the inside of the palm tree, I wish I had brought one piece out of that also. I don't know how they took out the inside of the palm tree and made all kinds of things out of that. And they, inside of the palm tree they say, there's a natural things there and they are painted it. So something so extraordinary. Very delicate work. Also they, here also you buy them, those boxes, with beautiful work on them, some sort of a thing they call it. But very cheap there, that's much cheaper. Much cheaper. This is, this is, this is, I am just a nice, see this works, you can see. Even a chef would appreciate that. It's a basket, it's a basket made out of cola. Such column, beautiful columns. Just see that. It's really masterpieces. What a workmanship. Beautiful. This is a basket, made out of cola. Take it out, get one. Only gone. Isn't it? I mean such minute things about how to speak of it. It's beautiful. It's a flower and a basket and some fruits. Beautiful, right? Last word I have to, I'll be excited. No doubt, I mean, sir, something with the last word that you can say, out of that please. It will be quite hard to carve the coral. No, it might be hard, it might be like also, if possible. And to put a design on a piece like that, not one piece. And what procedure? Precision. Very delicate, very delicate. Delicacy is the point I am saying, the very delicate. Whatever instrument they used, must itself have been very delicate. The instrument used for carving, must have been also very delicate. Very delicate. And the eyes have to be excellent for such a thing. I mean, even Sakunat B.B. and things like that. This saree was going to be one of the Guru Sujjha's and the workmanship of this saree is also something so remarkable. That's, there's a Guru who is giving the diksha. The whole thing, you can see later on, I'll send you over, the saree. The whole thing, see that it's such a minute work, just have a look. Very delicate. It's all movements, very delicate. It's beautiful. It's beautiful, it's a world. See, very delicately they can work. See, this one is so delicate. It's all woman, that's the part of it. I don't know how they do it. They don't think they do it also. Perfect Indian. In India they might do it in Ivory. You may try. Ivory, India is quite good to see. They make balls in balls like seven balls in the world. They can rotate the balls like that in the one round thing. I don't know how they manage it, but they do it. But this, this one also you can see if they can do it. They carve out elephants in Ivory, which you can't see with the naked eye. Naked eye. In a small age, shell like that, a small big shell, there are hundreds of them. And you open it and put it on your hand and you can only see with a magnifying glass. Every elephant will do it. They get blind doing that. I don't know how they do it. And they don't have magnifying glass, that's the best part. I can see in Ajat Dabhi's time, Ajat Dabhi's. They were all done with naked eye, it's nothing, they didn't use anything. But here if you have to see, then you have to put the light to see. And what work? Reminders work. We asked them how they must have done it. They said they used water to reflect the light. Water to reflect the light. That was to be like, they must have put in some water. Some water in some container. Yes. Or mirrors could have been. No, they didn't have mirrors. They didn't have mirrors like that. Only water. So they put the water in an angle, so the water used to reflect. The light. Otherwise it is all dark. So dark, but still in that light to do such work. Yes, yes. And they already get their stones there. These are like balls, the stones are. If you break them inside that, you find there are all sorts of quartz, all kinds of beautiful. Also you get some slightly precious ones. So they used to dissolve it with some sort of a solvent and they painted with that. It's like a bowl, you see. You didn't see them when you went to Ajata? In Nair. Quartz they were selling there? Yes. Yes, they were selling there. They saw them? Yes. And if you break them you get the bowl like this. They had a solvent. They used to dissolve that and they have used those. What is it? They call them thunderballs, mother. Thunderballs. Thunderballs. Thunderballs. Thunder eggs. Thunder eggs. Thunder eggs. There is Sydney people have it. Yes. You have them? You also have them? Yes, they are little ones. You have them? Small ones. Yes, a little one I've got. No, no, they are so big and fat. Yes, some are big and some are little. Yes. They have them here in Sydney? I don't think you can get them here mother. I'm not sure. They must have brought it. We brought them in between here. So that they would dissolve into some sort of a solvent. What was which one and that's what they used. What did you use? That's why it's over the last. Seven generations. They started first essentially before Christ. Two thousand five hundred years. Before Christ. Five hundred years before Christ. But ten generations long, no, eleven centuries like that. It's a bond of conflict. Eleven centuries. Eleven centuries. Could be ten generations. Eleven centuries would be twelve generations. Yes. Yes. But what is their acidity? Just if they have never seen Buddha, Buddha never came that side. From what devotion and how they did it? It's a jungle. I mean there's nothing available. No food, nothing. Monks. Goodest monks. Monks. And they have depicted all kinds of life there. Also there's somebody wearing a belt and skirts and hair dresses, all kinds of. I don't know how monks thought of all these things. See they have shown even Romans. Romans they have shown Romans. Because Romans physically. Yes. They have shown this. A long time back. Much before these people came in Moskoli, Rama and all that. Before that Romans had been. We had trade with Romans. Yes. We had trade with Romans. Because this python which is the place of Shalivana, the Sathvanas, they have got coins, they have found out Roman coins. Such an old couple of them. So I hope you'd like the name. I am the Chandru. Thank you. See, this is CP's name is Chandraka Prasad. CP's name is Chandraka Prasad. That's the name means the blessing of the Goddess. See Chandrika is Chandraka. But they also have Chandraka. Goddess name is also Chandraka. But also they have made Chandrika into Chandraka. In the UP style they use Chandrika for Chandrika. But that's the name also God's name, God's name. Prasad means the blessings. Prasad, they must be knowing. They are not Sahaja Yogi's. My Sahaja's name was Prasad. Prasad, God's, my father's name. His name is Vinay, Vin's modest name. Or we can call it Vinay is also name of Shri Damesh. Very few people know me by my name, the Christian name Vinay. All know me by my nickname Mahasana. Mahasana. So I've become known here also. Yes, called as Mahasana. Vinay Kumar. Vinay. There's a difference in my passport. It's in the name of V.P. Salvi. And the ticket is V.Salvi. You're asking me, oh, this difference has come. And said, don't worry about it. So should we now go and rest for a while? Would you like to rest, Mother, please? All right. Thank you very much. Nice meeting you all. I'm very happy to talk to you. Thank you.

It's quite a crowd. It's a crowd. CHEERING CHEERING CHEERING CHEERING AND APPLAUSE APPLAUSE CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Wow. Oh, yeah. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE APPLAUSE Oh! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE APPLAUSE CHEERING AND APPLAUSE CHEERING AND APPLAUSE CHEERING AND APPLAUSE CHEERING AND APPLAUSE CHEERING AND APPLAUSE APPLAUSE CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Welcome to Ganpati Puri. APPLAUSE You suddenly got cold and I think you should be all careful about it. Not to expose yourself too much, especially in the night. Be careful. Ahh. Today's program is first to announce all the marriages fixed. We have already announced so many marriages and so many were not fixed. We tried to do the last bit of it and it will take about half an hour only. But whosoever is called, please stand up in your own place. We don't come down. We tried, you see, very difficult to have an international marriage. We tried to match as far as possible with their heights, with their education and with their looks also. I hope you like our choice. But if you don't like, from today I am telling you, please let us know that you don't want to get married or you don't want to have a particular choice for yourself. Ahh. It's much better to do it now but after getting married, passing through all this audio, if you say no to someone it's very hard because sometimes you are registered and lots of problems are caused because of that. We thought that all such people who after marriage misbehave or say no will have to go out of surgery. We can't tell you. Now you have four days you have to decide, four days. And in that time if you cannot decide then we can't help you. But don't say it's an atmosphere, it's somebody says, nothing. You decide on your own. It has caused us lots of problems so far through. But I told Yogi that stop this marriage business. As it is there are lots of problems in the choice also. So in such a short time whatever we have done also we must have made some mis-adjustments. I accept that. If you don't want to marry someone, you please tell us. We are not going to get angry for that or say anything. But understand that we have tried. Now there are some people, thirty-nine year old, suppose, and they want to marry only Indians. It's impossible. And under these circumstances we can't help you. If you put restrictions, of course we observe the restrictions. But in that case there's problem. So now we start, alright? Also those people who have been announced before, there were some girls who were missing, some boys they were missing. So also you can find out and try to match. Yogi has been working very systematically, he's working very hard and don't think that I have not seen. I have seen all of them but still you must know that in such a short time to decide is very difficult. Siddhartha Gupta from Nagpur. Only those announced should stand up please.

Francisco Fellini from Argentina and Maria Angeles from Argentina. Thomas Anthony from Angkor but we have found out that Russian girls are the best as housewives. They are very satisfied, I must say. They are not about the rescue, how much you are earning, what you are doing. They are very satisfied and they can live with two, three sides. Very sweet girls. They are very good looking. And also from other countries like Romania, Poland, they are very good girls. But I am surprised that Indian girls are very fussy and some of them want to know how much is the pay of the husband and how much you can earn, very calculated. So we have avoided such marriages, you see, because you have to fight your life in Sahaja Yoga. Because you, who got married before, didn't have much money but your mom. Your faith and everything worked out well. So two extremes are there. Thank you. This song that Sai is going to sing is a new song written about the glory of the lotus feet of Srimad Gaji as to how we all desire to be on the lotus feet. Thank you. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.

You are trained, Miss Horeya. Your train has to leave. He's telling Me on one side, on the other side, He says, I must speak in English and explain to you what they are saying. It's very embarrassing because they are praising Me to the highest. They find it impossible to translate it and according to them it is all My grace, as they call it, Karam, that it has worked out. For God they have two names are like Rahim and Kareem and Rahim is the one who loves, Rahimat, who forgives and the Kareem is who is the one who does. So this language itself is a very symbolic language and the way they are singing is also extremely symbolic. But what I liked about them that they know very good classical music and also rhythm was very good. Apart from that, you see, they are singing from the heart. It's not just to please Me or to please you. When you sing from the heart it's different and if you see their eyes are just shining. They are all realized souls. Now I have to tell them later on about Mohammed Sahib, about Salimdha, Ali, his two sons, all the history about them which they don't know. Then they will know what they are singing has such a meaning. So they are all our own, they are all our relations and we all have to accept them as one of us. May God bless you. Thank you.

Sahaja Yoga is not only that you transform people, but you also transform the atmosphere. And the people who are different or who have not yet got their realization do feel that something is lacking in them and they have to find the peace. And that is how Sahaja Yoga spread in many countries, tissue-like zombies, where there are mostly Muslim people, mostly. But somehow they felt the joy and happiness on the faces of Sahaja Yogis and they took to Sahaja Yoga. This is something remarkable how people get impressed by you. So I'm sure that this country also will spread a lot of joy and happiness. As it is, this country is not only on a quarrelling basis, it is quite a peaceful country. And it should spread here the news of your attaining peace and joy. Sahaja Yoga to look at is very simple, but you know it is very deep also, deep rooted within us. So even if you get your self-realization and even if you have given realizations to another personally, still you feel you have still to achieve some more talents in Sahaja Yoga. I'm so very happy this has happened in this place. You can never expect it will happen. But by chance I happen to pass through to the Yogis and to stay here and talk to you about it. I would love to have your questions. Write it to me and I'll try to answer them to you. If you have any problems or any questions, please let me know. It was otherwise how can I know what are your problems are. So don't hesitate and please write to me. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank

But the police stopped us in the morning. Why did they not come? They came at 4 o'clock. Did they kill foreigners? They came at 4 o'clock. They came at 4 o'clock. They told me that they will come at 6 o'clock. I told them that they will come at 6 o'clock. But there are many people like that only. And they shelled my father. There are many such things. I told him that I felt surprised. I told him about their history. And I told him about my past. And it took at least 8 days. They said, we are going home. Let us go to the school. Let us do this. Let us not send them to prison. We will come back soon. But they went to the puzzles. Yes. Yes. ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... No, no, wait me please. Where is the contestant?

Yesterday they got beaten up by their wives. Do you know how many bad people they are? You have completed the program 8.30 am. No, no, I can't finish it at 8.30 am. We tell you in the morning. You had come here at 4 am, right? I didn't come here. I came here after coming here. You tell me. Hello, hello, Angapur village. You don't speak. Tell me. The police had come from our side. They told us that this is the program. You wait a minute. You don't say like that. Angapur village, I request you. We all should stand on one side. Don't try to make anyone to stand in the middle. This group is going to go now. Let them go. Hello, Lakshya. We will go on one side first. Then we will go through the whole program. Hello, Lakshya. Yes, come here. You see, you should just wait here till these people go away. It's because I don't want you to be hurt. Alright? So sit down. Just quietly. I think they are very quiet. I am their mother. I have given them the right to live. It's fine. It's fine. I am going. You go. Now, they have gone. They are going to check me. You are on the road. How can you do this? They have gone. They are not coming. Where? Now, they are on the road. Where should I go from here? You come. Listen to me. They will come. I will take them safely. Take them out. And take the girl with you. Don't leave her. Take the girl with you. Take their names. Take their names and see who is who. They are blind. They beat us. Sit down. They will go. I will tell you. What you will tell them is a very Vare vare. They are heritage is spirituality not science. What have they achieved in science? They don't even know English language. And they have got no idea about science, nothing. But they think you people are coming from the country of science and you know what science has done to you. That's why you must understand that this country there is a kind of a stupid understanding about science. When the British were here we were sticking on to our own culture. Science has no culture and that's why you all have lost everything that you had and you are having all your social problems and this violence and other. Because they are dealing with science they think there is no God. So they are not doing anything. They can do whatever they like, they can kill anybody as what is happening in the West. So these are few people here, not many. But still you must see that what is going in this country is very dangerous. That's why I have to request all the Sahaja Yogis of India to work very hard to spread Sahaja Yoga so that these people will be controlled. They are very criminal type of people, very criminal. Already one of our Sahaja Yogis was killed by them in Bombay. They are very criminal type and I think gradually the government will take over and they will be alright. They wanted to come on the stage because they can't arrange any program, they can't have people. Nobody is going to attend to their program. They wanted to speak from this stage. And people said that we have not come here to listen to you, we have come to listen to Mother. So just imagine how the violence is now spreading in this country and how important it is to spread Sahaja Yoga. You all know very well what's happening in the West. They are saying that I must be taking money from you. Now is there anybody who can say that? The absurd thing I tell you, just a kind of a funny aggression which has no meaning. So you should not really bother about these people because they are here. Tomorrow we will see to it that we inform the police about it and we will take them to task. I think we should carry some dogs with us. That's a good idea. If we carry some dogs they can attack them. Not we, we are not dogs. It's all a drama, you just see that. It has to go on in the history and see how people are. In a country where there is so much of culture, spiritual culture, we have such a heritage. They have no heritage of science. Now what are they talking about I just don't understand. I think some of the doctors are afraid that if we start curing people out of Sahaja Yoga they might lose their jobs or they might lose their patience. But there are so many patients in this world and I told them yesterday that I am not going to treat all the rich people. Let me treat only the people who are poor, who cannot afford to get cured. I told them very frankly. But they don't want to listen because they are all drunkards. They are all drunkards. And that's why they are behaving like this. Just like this they were shouting. So they couldn't, cannot see us enjoying anything. That's the main thing. They can't see us enjoying anything. And that is why it is important for us to understand that we are Sahaja Yogis. It's nothing compared to what people have suffered for religion in this country. For their goodness, for their righteousness. Shri Mataji is saying we don't have to seat for our selfish lives. These people on this planet have no connection. We don't have to tell anyone's anything you don't know about our lives, we don't have to watch the way they behave or its happened before. So let us not feel 1938 when they said they were interested in something, they were. But they don't know it, when they said a 3 ah parar mal may get me stuck in tears. Are you aware of that?

Koi shaani kai karta? He say Rangapur has a very special feature about it. You see, Shri Ramadaswami, the master of the Guru of Shivaji, found the statue of Shri Rama, Sita and Lakshmana in this river, at this point, in the Krishna river. And this was such a remarkable thing, they didn't know how the statue has come there. So it was taken to a place called Jaffar where they put it. Now Shri Ramadaswami, I have created lots of Hanumanaks out of the Magadha, lot of Hanumanaks out of the Magadha. And And many, many others And many, many other Hanumanaks. Shri trusting people would listen to them. Shri willing to get angry and to repel the Nanaka. Now it is understood that He is saving us all in two very difficult lives.

K landed on the street, the cops got scared and ran away. Rep Marriage Children are liked by parents. Baby girl Take care of her child. Mommy was banged. eman's husband Women don't get bruised in your home. Men can go few minutes. He'll go last. The Sahaja yogis, men have to go now by buses because the police is afraid that these people might try to trouble you. So they are going to get the buses here and you all should go in the bus. Now all the men who are here will not go but quite a lot of them will go. There is a one bus coming, one by one you go by bus. The police man is going to look after you, all right? The village in Angapur is called Savanam. My name is written here. Nirmala Mata Devi is here. And now they have stopped their work. So let us all stay calm. They have to go to their place. So Savanam is my name. No matter what kind of trouble we face or what we do, we should stay in this village of Angapur. I am a little bit of a believer in this. What he is saying is that the shop is here. The police came here before. The people of your village have come here. So they want to start their protest here. And they have received money. And what will they do? They will come. I don't know. What is wrong with you? What is wrong with you? What is wrong with you? What is wrong with you? But I don't understand. Is summer secret for us? No! I admit that tomorrow willruk another estos. The funding is due for the next month. It will be in two months. So nobody pays for it. I will never understand. No, no, no. If we really'll can do anything about it, we should leave the place. No you know that. No, we are successful fever. We can't do anything about it. Me? If you can do anything? It's easy to do that. Give me five rupees. Five rupees, money? Five rupees?

...words that I would like to end and I'm very happy that you have come and I will request Mataji to say something also. Now you ask Me questions. Come forward. Can we feel these experiences? What? Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes, you should, you should, you should, you should feel. Why not? Why not? You should. You want to feel it first before asking questions. That's the best. I mean, if you are a seeker you should ask for that. What's the use of asking questions? I'm not political leader, not seeking words. Best thing is that. Yes, why not? And specially you. Firstly because you are Indians and you come from Kerala where Adi Shankaracharya was born. Why was you born in this country? Great province. You can, why not? Just put your hands towards Me, you can. If you want to ask Me questions, you can ask Me. You see, it's a question of what you want. Not only that you can feel it, but you can see with your naked eyes the rising of the bone. You can see the pulsation on the triangular bone. You can see the rising very clearly. Absolutely, with the stethoscope. Now we have Dr. Bajorji Vida slathily, he's here. You can see it rising. Yes, that's the best. All right, you ask the questions first of all, the way you like. But you move forward. It's, it's a question just a split of a second the Kundalini rises. But there is a little part. The part of the Kundalini sometimes is blocked by your physical, mental, emotional disturbances, which are these different chakras, which we have to nourish a little bit. And can thousands of them get just like this, in the villages specially. That's why I said I'm more interested in the villages than in this five star hotel of mine. It's very easy to give realization to Indian people. Before them I can tell you. It's very difficult task to work in London. But in an Indian village it's just like this, thousands. Just like this. Because you see, definitely this is a yoga building. We have to be proud of it. But we have to know what our culture is. We have to know our heritage. At what time do you realize that you are able to realize this? Myself? I ask, you see, if you ask Me this question, I'll have to ask you one question, so that will explain. If I ask you what stage did you realize you are a human being? If I ask you a question, what stage did you realize you were a human being? You won't be able to say. In the same... I think what human was after, how long training? No, no, no training is needed for Me. You see, you were a human being. It is inbuilt. It is all inbuilt, you see. So supposing you are a human being, so your capacity as a human being is inbuilt within you, isn't it? You don't have to be told that you are a human being. In the same way it has happened. I don't know, I'm not interested in this part, how you will know that you are a human being. I don't know, are you in the same room? You are not aware. Yes, you are quite aware. Can you tell Me what moment it happened to you that you were aware? If you are able to determine what is what, then you will realize. You know you are a human being. In the same way you know you are this. You know this. You grow up like a child, first of all. Still you know that you are there. A dog knows he is a dog. A human child knows he is a human child, that he is not dog. Mother, what is the difference between your philosophy and the philosophy of life in the human being? Oh, tremendous, absolutely tremendous. Now, I would say one thing more. Again, you see, because I'm your mother and you must guard My state about it. Because you see, the government has sponsored this and all this is the first time I have yielded to a thing like that. So I don't want to fall into a controversy. But it's just the opposite of My own. I can tell you this one. Absolutely just the opposite. You just think of something like you give somebody a name. I mean, why do you need a guru to give a name? All right. Then you give a name. There's a big Shastra. If you come to Sahaja Yoga, you will know that different dateings are on different chakras. Then which chakra is wrong with you? Accordingly, you are to be told that, people that take that name of that deity at that particular center. Then that Kundalini moves from that center to another center. So you have to be told that. There is no talk of Kundalini, of chakras or anything. You just give somebody a name, you see. It is like saying that take this toothbrush and brush your teeth and you will have a little bit before and after sort of... It's all advertising thing. Moreover, it's much deeper. I've seen people who go to Transcendental Meditation are very difficult to get realization. Very difficult. We have got here three people from Transcendental. They have tremendous headaches, they suffered a lot. When they came to Me, they were just rattling like this. Now, you might say that I may be wrong too. You see, I may be wrong. But now how you do determine this way? That if you bring a mad person, a lunatic person, he also trembles the same way. If you bring a possessed person, he also trembles the same way. In the same way, they tremble before Me. And rather difficult to give them realization. They take time. You claim to be an avatar of this thing. No, I do not claim. I do not claim. I'm sorry. I do not. They do. You see, these people are not Me. That's the different thing. You see, this is the way it is. Always the human mind is from the other side and mind is from the other side. Why should I claim? Does the sun claim that I am sun? Why should I claim? If you are that, you are that. Do you claim that you are a human being to anyone? What is your concept of avatar? Avatar, you see, these avatars, it is a Divine. Now first of all, do you believe in God? Began me. No. Do you? All right. If you believe in God, God has to take you, say, from amoeba stage to human stage. How does it do it? How does He guide you? He has to have some way of guiding you. So, one of His aspects, which is known as the Vishnu aspect, you can say, the evolutionary aspect, takes different forms at different stages, comes on this earth and tries to guide you. Like a fish wanted to come out of this. So a fish have got it. Like that all the avatars are nothing but guiding leaders, which came from Divinely. There is another psychological way that they describe as Jung has done it. Jung was a disciple of God. He said that through our unconscious, in our dreams, they guide you. The Divine power guides us, the all-pervading power guides us. But dreams, when the time we are awakened out of dreams, we forget most of it, you see. So the guidance is not correct. After all, somebody has to tell you about the Divine. I have to tell you where are your chakras. I have to tell you how you catch them. I have to tell you what are these fingers for. You will see all this we have done very elaborately. And these fingers, what are these chakras are? Actually I studied your medicine, just to talk to doctors. I studied also a little bit of psychology to talk to the psychologists, because God does not have language. So do you have the same complaint that you are the second coming of Christ? No, I am not Christ. Christ has to come. But when He will come, He will not spare anyone. That's what it is, colouring. I'm just preparing for that child, because I'm a mother. He'll just come and slash out on me. He will come, but He is not going to come to give you Realisation and to convince you of righteousness and sin. No. He's coming for the last sorting out. What we do to our banana trees, when the fruits are out, cut them out in the same way. He's going to come for the last sorting out. And there's very short time, so we have to be careful about it. What do you do actually to release the fact that the fractions are... You see, what I do is, this... Come here, come here. It's all right. What we do is to... Now I'll tell you something about medical science, which is, you know, it's quite boring, but if you don't mind, I will explain to you what happens. Because, you see, if you ask Me to put on the fan, it's very easy to press the button, isn't it? But what did I do and how it worked out, what was the electrical thing, what was the history behind it? Of course, there is an organisation. So if you want, I can explain to you what I do. It's actually I don't do anything, I would say. It just happens that you have got already built in you the mechanism, the complete mechanism. You can open the page and see. There is a picture of a human being sitting with the mechanism. You can see, open yourself. So you can have a look at that. Then I have a diagram, one of that, so far. Now you can see here, you see, this one is the picture. This is the subtle energy, a subtle instrument within us. This is, this is, this is. Now, of course, I mean, you can't see this with your naked eyes, because this is an energy form. But if it is there or not, for that you have to come to Sahaja Yoga and see with your own eyes that this residual energy here, this triangular, bold residual energy rises like this and opens out this. This is the baptism about which Christ has told you. He said that you are baptized, but not by the people who are graduated from theological college. You cannot graduate. You have to find it. You have to become a saint. That means this must open out. Unless and until you are enlightened, like a light, which is enlightened, like a candle which is enlightened, can enlighten another candle. Now you have to be a candle to begin with, and that is the candle you are. You are already made like that. You are an instrument which is already prepared, like this, you can say like this tablecloth. You are made like this, like the computer, and you are just to be put to the mains, and the whole thing starts from there. It's the fine aid of the whole thing. Now what I do in medically, I have explained in my article here, which means this is your, I had addressed to the medical people, and this is the address that you can see for yourself. But it works. Now, this one is here. Now, what you can understand is that God has made you from amoeba to a human being, all right? Now, after human being stage, what does He want you to be? Why did He make you a human being? Why were you made? Have you got your fulfillment? Supposing I make some machine, then you'll ask, Mother, why are you making this machine? That must have its fulfillment or not. That instrument must have its fulfillment. So you are made like this. It is already made, it's all prepared. I don't have to do anything. Just what I do is when the Kundalini sees, because it is a consciousness which knows Me. It just runs automatically. But how do you do it? How do you do it automatically? You see, because it is a consciousness which knows. It just runs. How do you make a fish rise to a weight? What do you do? It has the hunger. It is just... It's about the consciousness which is in the latest. In the? Consciousness is in the latest. In the? Yes. No, this is the residual consciousness. The consciousness has many, many aspects. You see, we have, in different ways, we have consciousness. First of all, we have the conscious mind which you are listening to Me, all right? You are listening to Me. Now, all the experiences and everything that you are listening to Me is going into your past. So we can say that is the subconscious. Then with which there is a conscious mind which also thinks for the future. That is the pre-conscious mind. Now, I am talking about the super-conscious mind where you become one with the All-Pervading Power. So you become collectively conscious. You become that. Now, they can feel your Kundalini, they can feel your chakras, they can see what's wrong. They are just like you to look at nothing, no difference. But inside they know and you will also know because it is an actualization, not just talking a brain wave or just a sermon or sitting down giving a pravacchana. It is not. It is a happening that happens within you and when it happens, you become into samuhit, Chetan has collected consciousness. It happens to you. You just become that. For example, see, human beings, they are better than human animals. How? How do you know they are conscious, this is better? For example, you take a dog through dirt field. It won't mind but human being will mind. A human being understands the beauty, the combination of colors of things. A dog does not understand. This is a different dimension that you have to reach, all of us have to reach. This is your evolutionary jump now where you become conscious of that All-Pervading Power about this Shunabhi here. It is so dynamic, you can't imagine. Sitting down here you can feel somebody's vibration. You can cure, of course. It is already built in, you see. Like I come outside and I can push the button, the whole thing can start working because it's all built in. It started from the amoeba stage or even from the, you can say from the carbon stage, even earlier when it was just a power which got into many forms and now that is expressed through you. You go to another level of consciousness where you become electrically conscious. As I was telling Mr. Rajat the other day that first you know yourself, you know your power. Without knowing yourself you cannot know God. Like without eyes you cannot see the color, you cannot know God without being self-reliant. If you go to a temple, what do you do? It has to make an everything. You have to become that. You whatever you may do in the name of God, God does not know you because you are not connected. It's like telephoning to somebody, you cannot connect. Once your self is connected with God, then your own property, the Sampradaya you get. Now you are a capitalist when you get your something. Then you have to distribute. If you do not distribute, you are not happy. So you become a real communist. There's no forcing about, just flows. You can't live. Like the sun. Sun is the greatest communist you can think. But if it did not have light, how can it give you such? And then you do not want any rewards, nothing. You just force. It emits. I'm talking of that awareness, which we have not yet gone into. Shankaracharya has talked about it. Who has bothered about it? You see our great politicians, I've proved very much against them. But what I'm trying to say, they are all English people. We are more English than the English are, I can tell you this. What we have to project is what we have. So our politicians cannot be the same. Our politicians cannot think that this is the thing we have got in our country, our spiritual heritage. Let us put this and manifest this. We will leave the whole world one day, if you tend to react. We are very great. You have no idea. I mean, you have no idea about yourself. And we are much happier people than them. They have to learn from us. They have finished their family and lives, they have finished their societies, they are very unhappy, the richest countries, Sweden and the maximum number of societies. And for your information, in England, every two children are killed by parents, legal children are killed by their parents, mother or father. Can you think of such a thing? They have become absolutely animals. Where are we developing ourselves from? Why not short-circuit it and bring them round also? They are extremely unhappy people. And we have got this such a great thing and I have got it here. You see, now in America I'm refused to go there because the doctors there will immediately pick it up, you see. This is your thing, your heritage. You should have it. I have to teach them about Swami. Gregor also, you see, he knows right here, he's from Switzerland. I have to teach him what is Ganesha, who is sitting down here. He knows about Christ because he's a God. But what about others? Ganesha is the same as Christ is. He's the same incarnation. It is Christ who is nothing else but Mahavishnu. I can prove it on the Kundalini. You can ask any absolute question once you are realized. You get vibrations and you know whether it is the actual. It is fantastic. But you see, I cannot have a, as he said that, I can't have cheap popularity. You see, if I have fragrance you will come to me. And how can you charge money for such a thing? I mean, it's insulting, isn't it? Even to think like that you cannot purchase God. And it's nice, I don't have to have ashram now. I can always bring people to Kovalpil. You see, even a building an ashram is a headache. Everything is a headache. They wanted to have ashram in Bombay. I said, I will agree to ashram, you collect money. But I don't need any money from them. And how can I take money from my children? But I said, if you want to have ashram for yourself, please. But one condition is that no black market money is doing off. And seven years they have tried, they cannot have ashram. For such wretched, sinful people, why should there be ashram? Just not one person has offered us that Mataji have this place. But they don't mind giving money to this, Mahesh Yogi, this Yogi, that Yogi, all those people. They have got roars of them. Now this Rajneesh is another fellow you must have heard of. I don't know if I should mention it under your this table. But you know what sort of a mind is? Come on. Shri Mataji, can you tell us something about your background, where you were born and your education? My education? Yeah. I did medicine. You see, I never needed any education as such. But I did medicine because I wanted to be a doctor. I also studied psychology. And she is also a very well-known doctor and she is also, was a professor of chemistry. And the lady who I have cured, Nahi, they are saying, the one whom they know about in London, you see, her husband was my professor. And he could not believe that this is so. They cannot, you see, the scientists cannot believe that there is all pervading power. What can scientists do? You see, I don't blame them. Because if they see this is red, they say this is red. But supposing you are a doctor, you are a doctor, you are a doctor, but supposing you have eyes like microscope, through which you can see more than this, then you can prove it to them. So I said, you take your realization, then you can see this. Now they don't want to take it. Now, I cured is, no doubt, I've cured a hundred percent. I've cured so many cancer patients, my disciples have. And cancer cannot be proved by anything else. But, Sahaja Yoga, take it from Me. It was born with me. So My background is that My father was a congressman, a very fellow congressman. And he also came to Kerala once to do a lot of Tamil things for elections. He was a great speaker. And also he was the member of the old Central Assembly, where there were only two, from Madhya Pradesh. And then he was the member of the Constituent Assembly, then of the Parliament. And like that, I have a background. I, Myself, I have been tortured by the Britishers and they have really tortured My life. Because in 1942 I took a very active part and naturally we had to be free. It was important, before getting free, how one would understand it. But as soon as we got freedom, you forgot that you are in this. So now you are finding how to be free. I know that, I know that. You see, I have no bitterness about it. You'll be amazed, the British today, the younger British, the younger people, are very different from their fathers. They are such excellent people that in the foreigners, I would say, they are the best. Because they do not have a shifty nature of the Americans. Americans are doing only good shopping. You see, they are very solid people. They don't take to Sahaja Yoga easily. They seek for themselves and then they come to it. You see, they are the most blessed people, I don't know, maybe they have got blessings of this country or whatever it is. But they are the most blessed people, they are the most balanced among all of them put together. And that's why My husband got elected and that's how I'm there. So what more background you want to know? I have got two daughters and four grandchildren. And you know about My husband? Yes, I've got it. Now what more? Who is he doing? No, who is for that? I'm the Guru Mata. Now who could be My Guru, tell me. Every one of you is, really, to be very frank, because I have to understand about four people. To you I understand. I really don't understand you. And to all of these people I have got. So I should say, you are My Guru. That's the way it should be. How old are you? How young are you? I'm very old. I'm forty, I'm fifty-six. Yes. I'm fifty-seven now. Yes. In terms of what? I'm quite old. Age, it has to be accepted. You see, even God has to be a normal person to talk to you. I have to become old, I have to use jashma, I have to be just like you people. I'm not here to show miracles. You have to be absolutely a normal person, absolutely a samayana, just like you. So that you'll accept Me much more, you see. You mean you have very much total control of the world in life? Not at all, it's all nonsense. It is just a show. What are you doing? You see, if you are wearing, say, those dresses to show that advertising that I am a sannyas, you don't know. It's just a happening within yourself. It's a happening within yourself. Nothing. On the contrary, I bless all the families. Family is the most important. And do you know there are some very great souls who want to be born in this country? Nothing else. Why do we have overpopulation? Have you ever thought of it? We used to pray for fertility. Do you remember that, few years back? And why people are trying to be born here? In England there is a recession. In Germany there is a recession. People are giving money, incentives to produce children. Children are not born there. In Sweden they are borrowing children from India and they are also going to Colombia and taking children with them, orphan children and all. Why children are not born there? Why? Because which sensible man would be born in those wretched, horrible hellish countries? There is any way. No sensible man. That's why we have to bear the law. Don't you be afraid of your population. Yes. I think there are no people with strong beliefs in Swamis. They are more adept in the career side. Yes, they are. No doubt you are correct there. But still people don't open their eyes. They do not have wisdom to see, you see, because they have a glow around them and they go with a big bump and show and this and that. So people are so superficial. They are accepting. Like I was telling about the Rajnees. In London only nine people started their show, you see. And it's a very funny way they started, in a basement. They had no money. So they took out all their clothes and started dancing and shouting. Some people came round to see them. Now they have thousands. They don't know what to buy. They will buy the whole of London when they are in. But one simple thing is, in this respect, in this licentiousness and publiceness, why do they need a guru? I mean they can teach all of these gurus. There is no rising of the Kundalini or anything. It's all happening. It's not rising. It's possession. By becoming naked, if people can become, realize. Then I think in Kerala half of the people will be. It's all absurd. You see, you are intelligent people with a heritage. It's a silly thing that he is to, absolutely silly and foolish and he is a panther. He is to insult the Devi, to insult all the chastity. He is the one who has taught people to absolutely convert it. You'll be shocked the kind of people live in that place. You have no idea. These people cannot even tell you. I mean you are too innocent to know what sort of people they are. If you don't give in the paper, then I'll tell you one. But don't give in the paper. It's too much shocking. Because we, king, know they are very happy. There is a law in England and all over the western countries that a man cannot sleep with his mother. Sleep with, doesn't mean the way we sleep with our mothers but the dirty way. And a daughter cannot sleep with her father. There's a law. We don't have such a law that don't do dirty things. You see. But they have a law. Now they are wanting to break that law and there's a big procession at the parliament. I've seen with My Una is in BBC, on the BBC table. They are demanding that this law should be broken and we should be allowed to enjoy it. Now can you think of such a thing? With all your advancement, they are silly people, idiots, idiots. You see with ego one becomes an idiot. You must have read Tulsidas's Ramayana. In the Ramayana they have shown how even Narada became an idiot, it is ego. So even Narada can become an idiot but they are all idiots. Absolute idiots. You don't know how to talk to them. Absolute idiots. What affluence they have got? They haven't got even one cotton dhoti that you have got. They have only plastics and nylons. Why do we need nylons for this nice climate of ours? God has given us such a beautiful planet. Why do we need so many clothes? Oh, we can live in a hut. Now they are coming and living here in a hut and we want to have parishion with us. Just a minute. Now more questions? You must, you must, all of you must ask because you see I don't, because intelligence is such, you see it always stands back. But this is beyond intelligence. It's a happening. Supposing a seed is to be sprouted, what intelligence are you going to put there? It's a living process. You cannot do it by thinking. It is built in you, it will work. But here the people are very well educated, you see. In English, not in Indian philosophy. It's a same. It's a big same. Look at God now. Just see. Not only He but all these, He's an Englishman. Now we have Philippa here, she's a great writer, but she's a difficult, she's there. She's a writer, you know, just. Oh, they have sorted it out. Once they have found the truth, they have sorted it out. All Markandeya, all Shankara Charya, everything. Nobody did Shankara. You read Shankara in our country, you tell me. Huh? You find it? No, no, no, they will tell who is the. You see? I mean that would be very sad. So that really, just imagine, just imagine. How can people respect us? We don't know anything about our own Motherland. So it is Sahaja Yoga is not only the, you can say the evolutionary process, but by evolution you reach to reality and the thing. And it's a revolution, complete revolution. Is also a dharmic relation. For example, in the temples, not so much here, in the north, what are these pandits mean then? Horrible people, all of them as rakshasas, sitting down and taking money from this person, that person, you go to Padarthi. Where poor these people walk all the way, you must have heard about this cult, which the people go singing, walking for miles together, for one month they walk and go to that temple. And there are these pandits called the padami, that means the beaters. They really take the heads of people just like a coconut in the middle. Actually like that they do. And they are minting money and they read such a and such a wide lab. In the name of God, actually they are mammals, they are not human beings. So it's a revolution against them also, to prove what are the mantras, to prove what are the deities, what is the reality. We have to get rid of all these nonsensical things which are sitting on our body and on our being, complete. Who is the Brahmin? Is the one who has sought the Brahma, the realized soul. Brahmin is not born. And somebody told me that in the geek as soon as I think, who was Vyasa? The one who has written Gita. You know who, Gita at least. He was a son of a fisherman. That's really legitimate. How could you write that you can be born as a Brahmin? You cannot be born. You see what we talked to the caste was this, the aptitude, that you are a Brahmin by aptitude. That means you are seeking God in the Brahma. But the ones who are chakya, who are supposed to be chakya, are the people who are seeking power for joy. But joy you can only get through this all-convening form, through your own being, through your own spirit which is the meaning, which has to come into play. But when it comes into play these vibrations start flowing, which we call as chaitanya. They start flowing from you. Like Christ has said, somebody touched this robe, but he said, my energy has passed out. What do they know, these Christians, what do they know of Christ? Imagine this oak, wearing all these big, big diamonds on top of his body. How many diamonds did Christ have? And in Colombia I went down and I went to Chile and Argentina. And foolish people, they said, if Christ was not born a poor man, then he would have been more effective. That's all. How to talk to this man? You see, if Christ was king, he is a temporary man. Those who are hanker of things, how can they be kings? The king is a satisfied soul. Supposing you make me sleep here, I'll sleep here. If you make me sleep there, I'll sleep here. Such a person doesn't need it. How much do you need really? You have only seven days, sir. You don't want me to expose yourself. You see, you have to be very careful. You have only seven days, sir. You don't want me to expose yourself. You see, whatever you want to do out of Me, I'm here. And I will be free in here. And I have told Mr. Varadarajan that I would love to be the villages. And I'm for them. But here I have come. It's a good thing in a way. I must praise your minister very much. I met him for the first time but I liked him for one thing. He's such a rare person, I mean, to think he said that this is the heritage of our Mother Earth. Daruh, in Hindi, it's Daruh. This is the heritage of the Mother Earth. We should project this instead of casinos. You see, they have casinos, they have ballroom dancing, much better than you have. Actually, nobody comes to India with that idea. They come here for peace, for peace, about which they know of. While they come here you give them cheap chairs and this and that. They do not want it. You ask all of them. They come for peace and for relaxation. And he said that, that we should project this instead of projecting their sort of synopsis. That's why perhaps I'm in England because English can teach us. So that's why we won't learn it directly from them. Is it so that we have to learn from English? If you want to have experience or anything, you can stay on. I would like to see. And moreover, one more point I would like to see because Parjurji has said that there is a village where people are suffering from this. There's all these things, you see, there's all these things which you, everybody gets to do. Yes, we have to neutralize it. How do you leave those things? You neutralize it. Yes, you neutralize it. Otherwise people are not going to give up one thing to accept another until you become so tangible. Yes, I know. You won't. Yes, but you must become a political thought. No, no, no, not at all. Then you go from one extreme to another extreme. You see, you don't become politically wide but you be free within yourself. Then you do not jump from one to another. But then how can you win? How can you win? I mean, people are not going to leave those based on material things. They will, they will. We can neutralize. We have power to neutralize them. They will. You see, the winning is which way? You will need it. You will need millions of these people. We have. We have to have. We will get them. We will get them. There are so many other ways we can work it out. For example, cancer. You cannot cure cancer except through this. You must get your Self-realization. So all the cancer people, let them come down. We have a doctor here. He is practicing in London. And now I've cured a doctor's wife of cancer. So they will have to accept this. They will come. They will come. They will have to accept. There are so many other ways you can make them understand. Well, do you have a card in London? Because I've got a lot of... We had one lady working very hard in Tehran which another crowd should go there. This is now I mean... Like everybody else, they're all refugees now and they're all in a bad state. So if I can ask you to get in touch with people. Just can you give me one of the things? Have you got one? You must give. You see, they have really given a very elaborate... All are exhausting? Some. So we'll send it over to you. We have given in details all the things about this. What is the mechanism within you, the subtle mechanism, how you get connected with the males, you see, how you are made and everything. We have tried to do it in short and in quite a concise way. But we have given quite good information about it. And please have a look at it. What I think that I would like to meet the people of England who are actually sort of are... They think they are in charge, you see. I would like to talk to them about it. Because these young people, you see, they have no say. This is the problem why I say you will end up going into politics because there's no way anybody in the Western types that can do anything without having some game, playing some game to do it, to bring it to be recognized. Because the people, as you see, prisoners of their material way of life, and it blots out the problems. The moment they're living lives, it blots out from the scabies' lives to take people away from the scabies' lives, you have to offer them the most incredible inducement of all. It's not like a backward country where you can, like in Iran you had first you had the Shah, the monarchy, the glory, then suddenly you had Islam the other way around. But this is the only thing that would take away. The Shah fell simply because he didn't understand that Islam where they get all these people, but I mean Englishmen are not concerned about that. Englishmen are concerned, I say, about their football and their television programs and everything else. Life is too full, so you have to slowly get things closed down. Like your grandmother is making progress, so you have to start that way. Yes, you have to start. But I would say that your young people are going to also. You see, to get into politics and this and that, and this and that, it's a good idea. I have My attention on that. But I would still say I'm preparing them. They have to be something of a very higher personality to impress on others, you see. If they are to be defied like others, I have to prepare them. Can you imagine, I worked only on six people for four years. Now I have so many, only on six people. They were all hippies and taking drugs, but now there are three hundred people who have given up drugs at them, beautiful people. And they have had all kinds of experiences and everything. So it is going to work out. But I mean, if you think that some people would be willing to do something, because you have to think that you could be the leaders tomorrow. But I mean, do you have, I never see when I'm an immigrant, I never see any much on yoga and related subjects. You see, the trouble is we have been giving it in one yoga today, one article with very, very difficulty they published. And in the TV people they gave all kinds of fake gurus who have such an importance and everything. They even had what you call this Muktanandami, the Pope, but this nonsense and these horrible people, you see. I don't know why they make such fuss out of these horrible people. Those who have ruined your young people, they have reached them completely, made money out of them. Why can't they see? And they give them. But for Me, you see, somebody from India had gone who was to be filmed and so She said, why are you filming Me? You have got Mataji, who is the one who has given Me all the power to do this. So they said, no, no, we have had many like that, we don't want it. That's what it is. You see, it's very difficult now how to push forward things and we have a neighbour who is a MP, Conservative MP, who stayed there and you cannot just stop thinking about it. He is so mad with his politics. I told you, that's your answer, right? I have to start yoga politics. But I have to ask, now you just give some ideas to these boys how to literalize their money. I think we will work it out, we will work it out. We will, I am sure. You can't by being, I mean, you know, passive policies are no good to anybody. Because even somebody like Me who may be reaching a point where I may need something very soon, I mean, you are much too, how am I going to get My attention? It's impossible. Very soon if I go back to England, I will be immersed in the racing, football and everything else. It would be too much bother to come to you. You see, it is for them to think about it. Tehran was this was the problem. You see, Tehran they westernized it too much, the Shah. And they westernized so much. ...if you can provide, there is no alternative. But the point was that the left is not the left, it's the Muslims. Just think of my fallen dead body too much. They really genuinely believe that revolves whether it is a man who is highly scoffed and is defenseless or not ethics or anything else.

I bow to all the seekers of truth. As I told you before that the Spirit has the nature of being the truth itself. And this truth is the love of God. So the truth is that God is love. That this power that works in you is love. Love of God. And love of God is pure love. We have lost the sense of purity because of our own venturesomeness. But purity is where the love has no lust, no greed, it's innocent. Like the sap in the tree rises, nourishes the whole tree and goes back. It doesn't get attached to any particular flower or to any particular leaf and says that, I like this. It's absolutely detached. It just nourishes and goes back. But carnal love is like the sap rises, goes into a flower and gets lost. Thus the flower will also die, the tree will also die. And one must understand that when you get after realization what you have to do is first of all to see yourself how much you love others. How much your heart has opened for love. How much you can share. The individualism should drop out. That is collective consciousness. It doesn't mean that you can feel the chakras of another person. You can feel the chakras that you have the problems. You go on like that. It means that when the Spirit starts shining in your attention, first thing that you develop a great compassion for this human race. Not for the animals or for the bugs like the many vegetarians do, but for the human beings. They are the epitome of evolution. So you develop your love for other human beings because they become part and parcel of your being. Now for example, a finger is sick and the other finger looks after it. It is not doing any obligation. But actually it is soothing. Because if this is soot, all the body comes to a very pleasant state. If this is unpleasant, the whole body is in an unpleasant state. So if you treat one finger, you are treating the whole. In the same way your compassion starts flowing. But many people have very funny ideas about compassion also. And these must be corrected through experimentation. Some of the ideas of compassion are that you should worry all the time about people who are absolutely at the low ebb of life. As a mother I would say, you have to first mature yourself. As children you are still growing, that is what humility means. Understand that you have to still become the Spirit in the full way. And just now to jump to tasks of taking up very difficult cases will be very dangerous and you may get enwrapped into it and your progress may stop. So as humble students of Sahaja Yoga, first you have to learn how to master it yourself, to become a person who doesn't catch from other people, who doesn't get troubles from other people. In a way such a person has to be in a very cautious. Now I have seen so many people. They come to the programs, they find one person who is possessed, shouting, screaming. And a Sahaja Yogi who is really matured will say, now you get out of this place, you should not be here. Because that person will know that everybody will be troubled by this person. Because this person has got a disease which will be contagious. All mental troubles are contagious which people do not know, like psychologists. They don't know that they are treating psychopaths, they themselves become psychopaths. Because they have no way of protecting themselves. So first of all you must protect yourself and you find anybody like that, better not go near that person. At the most you can say, Mother, look after this man, if you have so much of feelings. But sympathy of this kind is very dangerous. I call it same means to share and pati means pathos. So you share the pathos of a madman and you get into troubles. So as good children I have to warn you that you should get more attached, more adhered to a person who is more evolved, more enlightened. Instead of that people start feeling jealous and get ego oriented and start fighting with a person who is much better. Now Dr Warren, as you know, has achieved it, a very late height in Sahaja Yoga. But in Australia I found many people who were really jealous of him for nothing at all and they wanted to oust him. While they themselves were at the low ebb and they always wanted to go to people who are at a lower ebb. If you have to go higher, then you have to stick on to people who have gone little higher and not to go to such people who are at a lower ebb, while they can come up only by looking up. So you cannot bring them by going down to them. So those people who have got Realization for the first time, who have just touched it, should not suddenly start thinking, now they have become the great evolved people. They have to grow, grow like trees and acquire the knowledge of their powers. For example, if I entered into one room, that doesn't mean that I have gone to all the rooms, that doesn't mean that I know what's happening in other rooms. So for a person who has got Realization, has to be humble about it, that I have to see more and I have to know more, I have to be better. This attitude helps a lot in their growth. And once you have achieved the higher state, which we call as Nirvikalpa, means doubtless awareness, after that you yourself can start with great enthusiasm, helping people, those who are much lower than you. This is one of the reasons many people who come to Sahaja Yoga go down and take lot of time to come up. Sahaja Yoga is becoming. It is not that you can make somebody a plastic Sahaja Yogi. You cannot give a certificate, all right, now you are a realized soul. It is you who has to certify yourself. It is you who has to grow up and it is you who has to master it. It is you who knows whether you have got it or not. So you have to have due respect for yourself and for others. The second problem arises that a person becomes bomb-shast, and starts quarrelling with Sahaja Yogis, taking sides of people who are negative, people who are not yet anywhere, is also a common sight I have seen with many people. So one should see what changes have come in me, what transformation has taken place in me. One can even write a diary to see how I become more compassionate, how I become more tolerant, how I become much more nourishing. Can I share things with others? Do I enjoy the company of others and the company of Sahaja Yogis? But that doesn't mean that you have to enjoy the company of the people who are not realized and not to enjoy the company of the people who are realized. In India we have very good saints and very realized souls, and their idea about human beings is very sad, because they think that human beings can never understand that when they have to grow up, they have to grow up with humility. Like a student has to learn from a professor, you have to learn from your Kundalini how to grow, how to become better by watching yourself. They think that unless and until the guru is very strict, actually like the gurus you have in the market, they are not. They are very different type of people. They are terribly hard task masters. If you see their methods are so horrifying that I shudder to send anyone to them. Once I had sent one gentleman, he had told Me there was one guru called as Gagan Gad Maharaj, who is a real guru, and he is very well known, but he lives in the jungles and his legs are broken and hands are broken by human beings, and he is carried by a tiger. So he told Me, Mother, if you, if anybody troubles you, if you are in difficulties with somebody who is very troublesome, you send him over to Me. So I said, all right. The one gentleman who was very torturous, he used to ask questions after questions like mad and very troublesome fellow, very ego-oriented. So just I said, all right, you go and see this guru. Now this guru doesn't see people at all, so he felt very enamored, his ego was pampered, oh God, the guru has called me, something great. So he went to that guru. After a month he came back, and like there was a big passage, and his legs were on his neck, and they were ringing him, as if dangling towards Me. I looked at him. I couldn't bear it, and tears came into my eyes. I said, what has happened to him? He said, Mother, I'm sorry for what I did. I said, what happened? He said, you see, when I went there, I was rather bad because I told against you to the guru. I said, what did you tell against the guru? He said, I told that Mother is giving realization to every Tom, Dick and Harry, and she should really first of all verify and then give realization and this and that, and I was talking ill about it. He said, yes, you are wiser than Mother, isn't it? And then in the night the tiger came and threw Me in a cart and fell down fourteen feet down. And then this guru lowered some bread after three days and asked that you can eat this food but stay there. And I was lying there for five days, and every day he used to lower the bread for him and he was there, all filled with filth and everything. After five, six days he sent three, four people to pick him up, and when he came up, he asked them to give him a bath and all that and it changed. And then he told that you put these legs around your neck and go dallying to Mother, she's the one who'll put you right, not Me. And if you ever say a word against Mother, then I will break your legs in such a way that you'll never be able to fix them. Poor fellow, he was shattered. And he came to Me, Mother, it was too much. Of course, his legs were fixed, he's all right, he's a good fellow now. But that is what they do, because according to them, unless and until you take them to task, you cannot humble them down. Like another fellow, I sent him to another fellow who was a doctor and who used to really bother Me too much. But I just told him, go and see this particular guru. So when the doctor came back, he was thin like sticks. I said, what has happened? Didn't he not give you food to eat? No, Mother, he gave me food all right, he was very affectionate. But what happened, why did you lose so much weight? What has happened to you, you are looking so very thin? So he was staying about seven miles, one had to walk up. And every day he had to carry two buckets of water to clean one dilapidated temple there. Every day he was supposed to take that and clean it. So I asked this guru, what do you mean by torturing him like this, taking these two buckets to clean the thing? He said, for a donkey you must give donkeys work. I'm not a mother to look after these ego-oriented people. It's better that he's trash now, he'll be better off. So this is what, the way they think people can be taught and they are to learn their lessons of spirituality in this way. Even when you go to them, they'll test you in so many ways that you absolutely get fed up and you leave them and they are very happy that you have left them forever. They are never anxious that you should be close to them because it is a thankless job, otherwise if you see, if you don't take any money, you are never rewarded, people try to always boss over you. So they think that it's better first to put them right, let them learn that you have to go hard with them to be the Spirit. But Sahaja Yoga today is not like that. As a mother I thought, let these children who are already under pressure and tension receive their realization. Let them have their realization. Let them have their light in the room and let them see what's wrong with them. Then they start seeing their ego, they start seeing their superego, they start seeing their conditionings, they start seeing their problems and gradually when they see it, they can cleanse it if you tell them how to cleanse it and they work it out. So after realization, it is very important how you look after yourself. You may be a king, you may be anything, makes no difference. In the realm of God, the one who is an evolved soul is respected. Not the person who just is a big man or something, a big politician, has no place. Only thing is who is more evolved. Even a simple person on the street can come to Sahaja Yoga and can rise very high. And a person who comes in a big car and a big way and tries to all the time impress upon Me the greatness of his worldly treasures, does not reach anywhere. So in the eyes of God, it is not important what you are in life, what your ego tells you, what you think of yourself. But it is God's judgment that He sees how far you are in realization. And in realization you have to judge yourself through your vibratory awareness. When this awareness stations down properly and you really become absolutely endowed with it, the joy of Sahaja Yoga starts trickling in your existence. People can see, those who never laughed, started laughing aloud, feeling the joy of life. The whole drama becomes sometimes a comedy, sometimes a tragedy, and you start seeing the whole drama as a witness. And when this happens, then a person really, really enjoys the beauty of their Spirit. But those who think that they are great and they have read this book and they have been to this guru or they have done this great job, they must know that it is not counted at all. It is how you are within yourself, where are your vibrations and what are the chakras you have opened out, how much large you have grown. That is how a person is known by his evolution. You are all seekers of ages. You are not a seeker of today. You have been seeking in previous lives and many lives before and so you are here today to seek the truth. And the truth is to be faced as the truth is. You cannot force the truth to be like you want to be. Like some people say, but Mother, I still like this. Then go ahead. I don't say no. I never say no to anything. I said, go ahead and then learn a lesson. Like one day I'll tell you about Dr. Warren himself, a very interesting story. It happened only few days back when we were in Singapore. I just tried some tricks and make them learn. Like there's another nice lady, very nice lady, who is very evolved and all that. And she got after him that we must go now to Kuala Lumpur because she lives in Kuala Lumpur and she was worried about the meetings and this and that. And I had told them that I'm going out and I'll be coming back and we'll all go together because there's a shuttle service all the time. And I said, we'll go by the evening plane. But they wanted, she wanted to go two hours earlier. And she was after him that, you better come along. Mother has a ticket and she'll come along. And there were other people with Me. So these went just to organize everything, two hours earlier, five minutes of plane. When they went there, they reached all right, two hours. But when I arrived at the hall, what I find that they were getting down from their car means they arrived even later than I had arrived. And I thought they'll be now very much embarrassed to see Me getting down with them. So I asked the driver, I said, let us go ahead till they come out of the car. And I asked them what had happened. They said that we got down all right, but on the way there was a big jam. And we didn't know how to go, so we thought, better take another road. So we came out from the pavement on the sides. And when we came out, there was all, we found that this was all filled with mud. So the car got stuck in the mud. And they had to pull it out and all sorts of things had to be done. And they reached little later than when I had arrived. Then she realized, she said, yes, that Warren was telling Me all the time that you shouldn't do something that Mother has said, we should go with her because she looks after everything, so why should we worry? So like that, you see, little, little incidents start occurring in your life and you start understanding that we are unnecessarily worried. Like sometimes, as our habits are, we want to go to the airport even before the aeroplane is fitted there. I mean, we are so futuristic. And there are people always with Me who are of that type and they get after My life saying, Mother, you should get ready now, we have to go, we have to go. And they become so quite wobbly. I said, all right, to put you at rest, I'll come. But there's nothing going to happen, we are just in time, don't you worry. So we reach the airport and there they say, suddenly the plane is delayed by two hours. So they can't understand the plane was not delayed and why the plane is delayed now. Now I said, now, settle down. Fix your left navi, fix your wobbly nature and let us work it out at the airport. This is what it is. One has to slowly and steadily understand that the God who has created this great universe is the one looking after. He is the one who is looking after us. His angels are around us. They all look after all the realized souls who are on this earth. All the beautiful rutumbara prajna, that is the knowledge of the enlightened mind about the seasons of beauty. They start enjoying it. And when it happens to you, even it happens to you, you just don't worry because you understand that everything is laid bare before you. And it has happened with so many people. But there could be another person who may not accept and say, no, no, no, no, no, no, we must be very careful, we must do this and this and start worrying. The same way they have been worrying. Actually some people get upset even if you mention them that you have to go to the airport, I've seen that. And then they find that they are losing their passports, they are losing this and they are getting so wobbly. In Sahaja Yoga, first of all, you must steady yourself. You must try to steady yourself. Put your left navi as they say. Here is the left navi. This one is to be put at ease, is very important. Because if it is not at ease, then also there is a possibility of you heading for some sort of a very serious disease like leukemia. As I told you the other day, that with the overactivity of this center, on the left hand side, people might develop leukemia because your spleen becomes hectic, it becomes very nervous and it becomes crazy actually, because you are doing ten things at the same time and you are yourself crazy. So this becomes crazy, it starts producing malignant cells and you develop a disease called leukemia. So first of all you must put yourself to a peaceful life. Now how do you do it? First of all believe that you are not going to miss anything in life. Even if you miss, supposing you think that you have to miss it. Like once at the airport we reached and the plane was leaked for five hours in Bombay. And in Bombay people know Me very well. They came to know that I am at the airport. Right from pilots to the loaders, everybody came there to get realization. And about five hundred of them came down and they got their realization. So My sitting there was important, My doing that work was important, so the plane was leaked and everybody enjoyed it. So to get upset about what you have thought that you are going to do next moment. And when you don't do it, then you feel, Oh God, the whole joy is finished. Because people live with futuristic ideas. The whole future they built in beforehand and they expect that future to happen and when that future doesn't happen they become miserable. Actually in Sahaja Yoga you are in the present, you are never in the future. Absolutely silent and absolutely peaceful with yourself, you are in the present. You are dealing with the present moment. So the present moment is the reality while the future doesn't exist and the past is finished. So where you are, you are in the present, where you are enjoying the dynamism of the present. And this is what I have found with Sahaja Yogis is that when first they get their realization, they either go to the future or to the past according to what they have been doing. Now the people who are, who have been indulging into the left side also can be very much harmful themselves because they also start living with their past. Most of them I have seen, they'll come to Me, Mother, My father is not all right, My mother is not all right, My grandfather is not all right, My grandmother is not all right. The attention immediately goes to the whole, whole lineage, to whole progeny, My son is like that, My grandson is like that. But if you get all right yourself, you are the center. You are the center of the whole core and once you are all right you can put everyone all right. But what happens that suddenly the attention shifts, you see, this is the habit, to shift the attention for yourself to others. Then the shifting starts about other Sahaja Yogis, that Sahaja Yogi is like that and this Sahaja Yogi is like that. And that Sahaja Yogi did this and that Sahaja Yogi did this. Like some people who are absolutely such that we cannot call them Sahaja Yogis but they come, they go, they are still going on and then people see them and they say, if this is the Sahaja Yogi, I don't want to be a Sahaja Yogi. It's like this, the shifting of the mind starts and people try not to be there but you must position yourself on your Spirit. You must know that you have become the Spirit. Position yourself is the point and then once you have grown into it, then you do not relate yourself in this way, that My father, My mother is My finishes. Then you think, yes, My father is here, who is a person who should come to Sahaja Yoga. You go up to a point, tell him, all right, if you can come, well and good. If he doesn't come, you are not father. You develop your relationship with the Father, God Almighty and with the Mother who has given you realization. This is very important. Then secondly it starts like this. Like, of course, there have been great saints in our country, like we can say that we had Sainath, he was a realized soul, a great person and his disciples would come to Me and they'll say, all right, Mother, you have given us realization, thank you very much. But Sainath, you see, we have Sainath's photograph, we worship Sainath. Now this is another start, is that now Christ is not here. So when Krishna came, they said, oh, we will talk about Dattatreya, not about Krishna. When Rama came, they said, we'll talk about somebody who came before Him. Never, when they were there. When Abraham came or Moses came, so they said, let us talk about somebody who came before. When that happened, then when Christ came, they said, let us talk about Moses. And now I have come, I have given you realization, then you would like to learn everything from Christ, who is no more there. He's not going to tell you. I have to tell you. That doesn't mean you are disrespectful to Christ. Christ is as much there as Myself. But I have to tell you, not Christ. That is not His responsibility at this time, it's My responsibility. And so one must understand, who has given you the realization? And that's why Christ has said, that anything against Me will be forgiven, but nothing against the Holy Ghost, because the Holy Ghost will give you the realization, and after taking the realization also, if you try to put yourself backwards, then you cannot go further. So one has to understand, that who has given you the realization? The same thing happens about gurus, there is that people are sucked back. But what have they given you is the point. You should know what have they given you. Have they given you something substantial? They have not. Then why are you sticking on to that, which is not going to give you what you want? They are not going to answer your question. They are not going to tell you anything about it. So why not ask a person who can speak, who can tell you, who can explain, who is in present? And this is another human weakness, that they don't want to live in the present. But some people will say, no, the Messiah is going to come after, say, two thousand years. Then you won't be there. Today I am here, so better have your realization, learn about it. When He comes afterwards, another one, then it's all right. But that time you are not going to be there. So the importance of present Sahaja Yogis must understand. At present what is the situation? Where am I? What have I done? I have to understand each and everything at present. This is the important time. I am not going to lose any children. Time thinking about the past or about the future. At this time what's My problem is? And then the growth starts. All living things, whatever it is, works on present, never on the past. Say, as I told you yesterday, a root, when it starts sprouting, there's a little, small, little cell at the end of the root. It just sees what is the situation at that time is. All right, at this time it is a hard soil, it waits. As soon as the soil becomes little better, it starts moving. Then it creates a boulder. All right, the boulder is there. Let's go round. At the present you have to achieve it. You can only achieve at the present, never in the future and never in the past. So this is another thing. The Sahaja Yogis who are realized souls must understand that they have to move with the present and not with the past. I had to go on fighting with people, telling them, now be in the present. Now the knowledge of Kundalini was never told so clearly, as it is said today. Now they will say, but people used to get realization after so much of cleansing and this. That was thousands of years back. Now we can go to the moon. How many people went to moon before? So do we say no, but they used to, never used to go to the moon, so how can we go? It's just like that. If something has worked out like this, that it's a jet Kundalini now, and you can go to your Spirit, you can become your Spirit. Why not take that one reject? It is because the mind is not attuned. The mind has not understood the importance of time. And this time, this present time, is the most important time in the whole history of evolution, I can tell, which you will realize very soon. It's the most important time, but people don't realize it. And for them, what does it matter? Oh, we can do this, there's nothing wrong, there's no danger. What's wrong in going into the subconscious? Why not get into the subconscious? Why not do this, what's wrong? When they suffer, they go down, they lose all their capacity to come back, then they will come to Me and say, Mother, yes, I did this and I did that. Best thing is that you must understand where you should not go, and you must understand where you can go, how far you can go and how much you should do. All this art of understanding is called as true knowledge of the technique of the Divine. The technique of the Divine has never been explained or told before. Nobody has ever understood the technique of Divine before, because there were not so many realised truths. It was a very exclusive thing, which was told to one or two persons. But today you are fortunate to be born at this time, that this technique you can know, you can handle it and master it. But even now, escape will be there in your temperament, so be careful on that point. Now the another thing I've discovered, that people think that if you destroy something, that is the past, this is another starting, then you will reach higher. This is another idea, like establishment, you destroy everything, destroy all the traditions, everything you destroy, and then you will become something better. It's wrong. If a flower becomes a fruit, part of it drops out, not the whole. Part of it becomes a fruit. In the same way, destruction completely is very indiscreet. And that's how people said, we are against establishment. That is wrong. Whatever is good of the establishment has to be taken up. Like traditionally, marriage is respected all over the world, was respected, today it is not. But I don't say about it, you will yourself find, how marriage is blissful after Realisation. A simple logical conclusion you should arrive, say, at this thing. Now supposing you have children, and these children are great souls, because you are realised souls, so the great souls are born on this earth through you, because you are really the people who can look after them. Now these children, when they are born to you, they find that there is no sanction of the collective. You are still not husband and wife. The collective has not sanctioned you. It's a stigma. You give that stigma to the child for nothing at all. You have no business to give that stigma to the child. Today the society is such that it accepts. But the child will always have the stigma. I have seen even with all your advancement, I have seen people, when they have to tell about their parents, they say, whether I am sorry to say, but my parents are divorced. I mean, they feel little lower than the people who do not have divorced parents. They feel that the parents have let them down. They feel that there is some sort of a stigma, a kind of a dent in their character, that their parents have not been able to give them that respectability. So the respectability to the child can be only given by the parents who are realised souls, because they respect themselves and they know how to respect. They respect all that is beautiful and good. After Realisation people marry, ninety-nine percent people, if they marry with proper idea of vibrations, become absolutely beautifully married permanently. There's no question of quarrel, no question of divorce, no question of anything. The whole thing becomes such a beautiful thing. There is no problem at all from them to Me. On the contrary, I find beautiful children appearing on the scene. And I really enjoy that beauty of such special type of children that come on this earth. And they also respect their parents. What's the use of fighting before the children? You don't give them the fighting spirit, do you? Have you to send them on the war? No wonder all these so-called developed countries are busy creating wars afterwards. They're headed to the rest of the country, you see. There is a war going on. There's always a fear that this country is going to invade that country, that country is going to invade this country. It's a big nonsense going on. It starts from the family, where the husband, wife are mourning till evening, just fighting before the children, quarrelling with them, ultimately ending up in a divorce case. It's a shameful thing to be divorced normally. But it happens. You accept it because society is accepted. Today the society is accepted, but the child will not be accepted by the society, whatever you may do. When the child will say that, I have no parents, I don't know who my parents are, or my parents are divorced, naturally the child who is coming from a family, which is not disturbed, will definitely stand higher than that child. You yourself must have seen that in your family, when the parents were fighting, how you felt sad about it. Because you are the product of both of them, and parents have no business to give that kind of a personality of deficiency to the children. Here the people are so ego-oriented, that they don't think of anyone, for them, I matters, I. I hate her and he hates him. It goes on like this, the hatred is such a accepted phenomena that the child suffers. Either he becomes an extremely exaggerated, volcanic, violent person, like I heard this time, this morning I went to the television, and there was a little boy of fourteen years, has killed another boy of ten years. I mean, we cannot think of this in a poor country like India, because we are fighting with our power truly there. But here when they have become rich, they start killing each other. This kind of violent nature you develop when you come from disturbed families. Now the establishment of a family is important, but the way it was established is not correct. Now after Sahaja Yoga the establishment is perfect, perfect harmony. Today only a couple has left for England who had come here, and this gentleman was not willing to marry the lady, and the lady was not willing to marry, but they were living together. And then somehow or other the lady thought she can marry, and then the gentleman would not. So I said, you don't see him for few days, and the gentleman agreed. Now the gentleman thanks Me every time for that, that Mother, this is such a blessing. And when they came here they said, we went on holidays so many times, we went to all kinds of beaches, where of course she burnt her skin and all this nonsense. You see, it's such all destroying stuff that you have, as she developed white patches here and white patches there, and actually she came for that. After doing all that so-called fun, they came to Sahaja Yoga, got married. And after marriage, what happened? That now a new type of a dimension of joy is pouring in them. They are such happy people. And now they want to have children, because first they didn't want to have children, now they are old enough. So I said, you better take a child as just a sort of adoption from somewhere. So now the Sahaja Yogis love their children so much, that will give them for adoption also. It's a big problem to get a child for them to adopt, who is a realized soul. Now all these things have happened in everybody's life. The mother has been quarrelling, or the father has been quarrelling, there has been problem on and this and that. And with that, the outcome is a person who is also a seeker. So imagine standing on a crocodile's back, you see, you are seeking your Spirit, and the crocodile is not going to leave you. So be careful that you have to jump into the this boat of Sahaja Yoga, leaving all that nonsense. You have to start your life afresh, change your ideas. Don't have all those frights, like people are frightened of women, women are frightened of men. This is something nonsensical. You have to shed out all these fears about each other, and then tie up yourself into complete love and romance. Actually now we are also, you have done in the West, so much search on love and romance, but I don't find anybody romantic. What I find is all the time they are talking ill of each other, trying to remove everybody's images. Only thing they are worried about, how to increase the size of their purses, that's all. There is nothing, no love, it's something so surprising. While where we are in India we can find our societies, I mean, we have really the real romance, whether we are old or young, doesn't matter. For us it is decided once for all, now this is your husband, this is your wife. And we enjoy, and all this experimentation leads you where? Ten people who are married are in the orphanage, the ten women are in the orphanage, ten men are in the orphanage, and the ten children are also in the orphanage. All end up in an orphanage, in old age they don't know what to do. And they, then they don't know whom to talk to, so they talk to their fridges or to their ovens, because they don't know whom to talk to, they are so lonely. This is the outcome of the so-called research was done on the romance and also of love. We are all part and parcel of one great being. We are not here to fight each other, that is malignancy. That is malignancy when one cell becomes more powerful and tries to overpower another person, then it is malignant. The enjoyment comes when you understand the co-ordination between the two, like two wheels of a chariot, one is left, one is right. They are stationed in their own places. Support the chariot and enjoy the right. This is what one has to understand. But gradually after Realization you'll understand how blissful it is. To be sensibly married, to have children who are great saints, and some of the children that are born these days are really so saintly and so beautiful, that after a child is born to a Realized soul, then I don't bother about their marriages. It comes round all right, because they know how to put themselves. It's so sweet and so beautiful. So that's how we have to gradually start seeing it, because our ideas are that establishment is all bad, family is bad, leave your parents, get out of them, they are the worst people ever born. You suddenly start feeling the goodness of your parents also. Start seeing them better. They see you better. They see you happier. They see you say differently. They ask, how is it you have changed my child? What has happened? They come to Sahaja Yoga. The whole family comes to Sahaja Yoga. All these things go on happening in life in a human being, but he doesn't want to change. Something is definitely wrong and is a very simple thing. We have forgotten how to love. Pure love is not there. If it is so, everything works out so beautifully. You really enjoy the company of all the Sahaja Yogis. Now if I tell them, now you go on a holiday. I say, Mother, this is our holiday. They are enjoying it. They are in the state of great enjoyment. You ask anyone there, they don't want to do anything else, they don't want to go anywhere else. I mean, even if I say, you go now, then it's all right, finished now, you go away. They feel so sad that they are leaving other Sahaja Yogis. You feel so close and so near to others. Those people now, Dr. Warren is a very well-known doctor from Australia and there are other people like him, who come to India. In India people are very humble. They live in the villages, they live in the small little huts. They beat each other equally with such joy. They never have that feeling of class consciousness. All this is lost. All the joy of just meeting another soul who is a realized soul, feeling the Spirit of that person, the fragrance of that person, makes you happy. So now you must know you are on a journey of the new world. It's a new dimension. So give up all that was nonsensical and gradually we'll know that this is nonsensical. Because if you ask the questions after realization, you can feel the vibrations. That's why there's a difference between one and another. I find that one has no vibrations and another has vibrations. And he will go on saying that this should not be done, but another will say, no, this should be done. But the one who has the vibrations must be always listened to. And that's how the things work out better and better and better. And this quarrelling ends up and you become very loving people to each other. This has to happen, unless and until this happens, if husband and wife, two persons can't live together happily, how do you expect the whole world to live together happily? By forming these United Nations, by forming these, all these artificial things, do you think they'll live together? They cannot. Basically what has happened is, they think they are individuals. They are not. They are part and parcel of the whole. Like one cell in the body is connected with another cell. In the same way you are all connected with each other. And that you can find out after realization. Once you find out, you feel so secure and so happy. You have brothers and sisters all over the world. Wherever you get, they will know that you are here. There was a girl who went to Sicily once. She, she is a Swiss girl, Ruth, and she just went there and she was sitting alone. She thought, oh, what a place Sicily is. There's not even a single Sahaja Yogi here and I'm just sitting alone. These people are all playing monkey tricks and she was just a little bit feeling lonely. And suddenly she felt vibrations. So she turned round, there was another girl sitting. She said, are you Mother's child? She said, yes, are you? And then they grasped each other. They were so happy, you know, and the tears started flowing through their eyes and people couldn't understand what has happened to these two unknown persons suddenly get into such jubilation. Her name was Gilman and she was a French girl. And they said it was such a pleasure to meet her there. Just by vibrations she felt the oneness and they enjoyed. Then they said the life was so great there in Sicily and they established a center in Sicily after that, both of them put together. Can you imagine? So all these things happen and then you understand that you are living with another language, with another life which is so beautiful and bubbling with joy every moment and you start seeing the joy everywhere and you're just enjoying yourself and also you enjoy the mistakes you have committed. You love that you are innocent. Oh God, I was like that. That was me, that's finished, now gone. So it was like this. And you just make fun of yourself and you really see that, oh, that was me, that was Mr. Ego of mine, oh, how do you do, why, why? It's a very interesting growth when I see them like that and when I see them enjoying each other. That's the greatest joy for me. There's nothing else I want. I want that you should feel that joy and that love among yourself. There should be no quarrelling, there should be no fighting, there should be oneness of understanding and move under one person. There's nothing to fight. Like I cannot contact every one of you, so there's one person appointed. Like here we have Steve and Christine, both of them working out in Boston. You'll find them extremely good people, they're extremely nice people, they have done a very good job. But maybe some person might be a quarrel, some person, fighting person, may fight them, doesn't matter. But you stick on to them. Till I find they are hopeless, they'll be there and when I find that they'll go away. So you should not worry, challenging their personality, challenging their leadership. Try, it will help you a lot because all of us have to be together in complete love with each other. Nobody wants to dominate anyone because we have to gain nothing, we have to gain nothing. It's a system where you give, this is the only system where you give. But we have never experienced before the power of love, the power of this purity, this innocence. We have only used head to it. That has been our power, so give up that and use this power, it's so simple. It works beautifully, only you have to learn how to use it. And it works sometimes with great strength, sometimes delicately, sometimes mysteriously, sometimes giving you lessons is very sweet. So you have to learn all these little little things when you'll enjoy how this mind is a monkey, how it works and how you watch the monkey there. And it's beautiful to see yourself like that, the drama of yourself. May God bless you all. I'm very happy to be here in Boston and you know I'm going away. And we have a little program tomorrow for which we have to sort out people. I don't know how they are going to do it. And I don't know whatever they want to do, they can do it. But we'll have again the session of Realization first. And after that we can see how it works out. But tomorrow's program is rather something which we don't expose people to normally because people are not yet ready, I should say to accept the truth is very difficult. So we don't expose people to that. But considering that I'm here today and tomorrow and I may not come next year, I don't know, they think that we should allow people to come down and get the experience deeper and we should expose them to Sahaja Yoga. But sometimes we lose some people with that. It's rather risky, I know that, but I don't know they will themselves sort it out, I don't know what to say. Because this is a higher blasting as you can call it, where you get your Realization much deeper and you understand yourself much deeper and also you get nicely rooted into your Spirit. But that we don't allow people to go through till they have established themselves properly. And that's the thing we are thinking about. We are in two minds what to do. Now it is for you to decide, I have to come to a ceremony like that tomorrow we are having, because these days, nine days, are very important days where the Goddess is worshipped and tomorrow is a very important day again. So we have to have the ceremony and the Indians know what it is now, Ratri, tomorrow is the very important day and that day all over the world that is going on, all the Sahaja Yogis are doing, so we have to do it and those who would like to come are welcome to come for that and also you are invited for a lunch there. Now today let's again have experience of Realization. Those who have come for the first time, please raise your hands. Quite a lot of them. Why don't we let them come to the front and let some of the people who had it sit behind and afterwards they can work on it. All right, what we can do, you see, just to adjust this, because those who have come here for the first time are to be given Realization, that's important. Others mostly have got it. Those who have felt the cool breeze yesterday and day before, please raise your hands, let's see. That's enough. All right, now what I would suggest that those who have felt like that should go at the back and those who have not felt should come forward, because those who have felt will know how to work it out themselves. So we can have them at the back side and we'll tell them how to do it. You must know that you do not know anything about it. This is not a dark room in which you have to enter. It's a thing that has to be logical, you must have all the knowledge about it, you must know what it is, what is the Kundalini, what are the chakras, how to put it right, how to give Realization to others and how to maneuver it. And anybody who has given you initiation, if he has not given you Realization, then better forget them. That's very important, that there are so many in the market, one better than the other. So I have to just tell you that those who have not given you Realization, if they are still in your head, better get rid of them for the time being, till you get your Realization, because if you go on like this, there's no end to it. You see, people here have gurus just like as they have locks, you see. They go in the market, this lock is not good, so that's all. See, it is the one who gives you Realization is your guru, otherwise who has not given you Realization is not a guru. So forget them. There are many in the market. The lady asked Me, I would say, forget all of them. She hasn't got Realization. Finished. You be selfish. In the sense you must know what you have got yourself. That's the important part. If you haven't got anything, then it's useless. I mean, you go to a shop, pay the money, you walk out without anything or at the most with a disease. Is it what you are seeking? Just it's logical. So if you have been to someone like that, just forget it. I'll try to neutralize it. I'll try, again I say, because there's no guarantee. But I'm sure it will work out. Don't have any doubts about yourself, that's all. You can have doubts about all of them, but not about yourself. Just slip your shoes off, because that helps you to be... Just slip off your shoes, please. And loosen many belts that are there, collar and tie, just loosen. Not to have very, very tight clothes in here or here. These are chakras, you see, so make yourself little loose there. Now, you have to put your both the hands, just like this, on your lap, very comfortable. You have to sit comfortably. First of all be comfortable. There should be no crowding up, there should be no problem as far as the bodily comfort is concerned, because your attention will be diverted. As I said, at this moment you are with Me. Forget the past. Whatever you have done or whatever has been there, forget it, forget it, forget it. You are not to feel guilty at all. At this moment you are in the present. So please don't worry what you have done wrong, what is gone wrong, nothing of the kind. You are seekers, you have come to seek the truth, to be the Spirit and it doesn't matter what you have done. Everything is forgotten, forgiven. So you also forget and always say that, I am not guilty at all. Don't live in the past, whatever has happened has happened. Now, both the feet should be on the Mother Earth, because She helps us to suck our problems. So just... And the left hand is the hand of your desire. Now it should act spontaneously, it does act, but as you know there are problems on the chakras. I have to work it out myself and you have to help Me that way, that you work it out yourself. So I will tell you how to put your right hand on different centres, to nourish that centre which is little bit weak. And you have to close your eyes. Please don't open your eyes. Even if you have spectacles you can take it out, will be better, because it also helps the eyesight. You are not to open the eyes till I tell you and it's quite some time that you will not open your eyes. So keep your eyes shut. Don't open your eyes. Keep your neck straight, not too much bending forward or backward. Just keep your neck straight. If possible don't have any hats on your head, will be good, because this Asrara has to be opened up. If you can take out your hats, will be a good idea. So this portion is left open, this has to open out. All right. Now keep your eyes shut. Put your right hand on the heart, on your heart on that left hand side. Only your right hand has to be moved, left hand has to be straight with your fingers stretched. Here you have to say or ask a question to Me, calling Me Mother, if it is easier, Mother, am I the Spirit? Ask the question, Mother, am I the Spirit? You should take the Malas off the table with Mala. Just ask them to take out the Mala. If you are wearing any Malas or anything from any guru, please take them out also, because they stop the Kundalini's awakening. So please take it out. It's better to be kind to ourselves and fair to ourselves, because we are here to achieve the Spirit and not to be belonging to anyone like that. We have to be ourselves to begin with, and then only we belong to the Kingdom of God. Now just say, Mother, am I the Spirit? Ask Christ. Ask Christ. Mother, am I the Spirit? Now put this right hand down on the stomach, on the left hand side and press it. This is the center of the Primordial Master, and as the Spirit is your master, you are your own master. So you have to say, Mother, I am my own master. You have to say that ten times. Shooji. After saying that, you put this hand little lower, at the lower side of your stomach, on the left hand side. We are working the left hand side only. Now at this point you have to say, Mother, teach me the Divine technique, or make me the Divine technique. Mother, make me the Divine technique. Six times. Good. Now you again put your hand on your heart. Now with full assertion, without any guilt, without any guilt, you have to say twelve times, Mother, I am the Spirit, because you are the Spirit, you are the Spirit, you are the Spirit. So you have to say, Mother, I am the Spirit. Mother, I am the Spirit. Mother, I am the Spirit. Mother, I am the Spirit. Mother, I am the Spirit. Mother, I am the Spirit. Mother, I am the Spirit. It's good. Now you put your right hand, raise it on the base of your neck, on the shoulder and pull it out a little bit. At this point you have to say, sixteen times, Mother, I am not guilty. Mother, I am not guilty. Mother, I am not guilty. Mother, I am not guilty. Mother, I am not guilty. Mother, I am not guilty. Now raise this right hand on your forehead across. At this point you have to say, Mother, I forgive everyone. Say it twice but with full confidence. Mother, I forgive everyone. Now put the right hand again back onto the back of the head, back of the head where the optic lobe is and push it, put your, push your head backwards and hold it tight. And say now here, without feeling guilty, again hundred times I say, without feeling guilty you have to say, if I have done any mistakes, O Lord, please forgive me. Say it thrice, without feeling guilty. Now put this hand on top of your head and press it with your palm in the center of your head and try to move it clockwise. But at this point I cannot take your freedom into My hands. You have to have your freedom whether you want your realization or not. So you have to say, Mother, give Me my realization. I cannot force upon you. So you have to ask for it. So just say, Mother, please give Me my realization. Say it seven times and move the head in a clockwise manner while saying that. Mother, please give me my realization. Mother, please give me my realization. Mother, please give me my realization. Now put the right hand without opening your eyes on your lap. Now, put your left hand up on your head, little about five inches, and see if there's a cool breeze coming in. Little higher, little higher, because at the little higher, about five inches, not too high or too low, but see yourself, you can move your hand and see if there's a cool breeze coming in. And in your hand also there's a cool breeze coming in. Now change your hands and see for yourself. Put the left hand on the lap towards Me and see with your right hand. Go on changing your hands. Now put both the hands towards Me and now open your eyes, put them on your lap, open your eyes, slowly, very slowly. Now watch Me without thinking. Now I'll teach you how to raise your Kundalini. You may put on your spectacles if you want to. Put the left hand in front of you like this, just like this, left hand in front of the Kundalini, like this while sitting down, and now try to move your hand from the Kundalini upward, forward, backward in a clockwise manner. Let's start. Now put it on top of your head and loosen your shoulders and twist it round and give it a knot, a big knot. This we have to do three times. Let's do it again. All of you should do, then later on we'll say, I didn't get it. Loosen your arms, put it up, put back your head and give it a knot. Do it again once more. Now this time you have to give three knots. One, two, three. Now see in your hands, are you feeling the cool breeze? See on your head also. Why didn't you do? It's all right, you put your hands, you'll be all right. Put your legs all right. See, is there cool breeze coming from your head? Put all your hands up like that and now ask the question, is this the breeze of the Holy Ghost Mother? You start feeling it in the hands. Now see for yourself. All right, there's no thought in the mind, there's no thought. Enjoy your meditation, just close your eyes, don't think. Now those who got realization yesterday should get up and see over the heads of other people and Dr. Warren will tell you how to do it. There's Steve here, they'll all see how to do it. Come along, I'll put your elbow right. Come here, this girl. Just see, don't open your eyes, keep them shut, they will see if there's a vibrations coming from you or not. All those who got their realization before should join them. Now see what happened to your elbow.

Now, I'm sorry you have to talk to them somehow. We have already made arrangements at sort of selections, they are you know, of marriages, for children or all that. You can have a picture. You will be able to sit here or I should I sit there or should I sit here? You can better you can sit here, you can sit here. You can do lesser. There are pictures. You can go back, you can go back.

Some people can come from this side, don't sit in the sun please. That's the sauna round screen. Now take their names, you should stand up and you can see for yourself. If it's all right, say yes. All right? I've been working on it for days together and then ultimately yesterday I think I slept at five o'clock in the morning. It's very difficult because you are from different countries. You are from different countries and also you are from what you call you between the ages, different heights. And very different, you can say, the aptitudes and professionals and things to match everything is very difficult and in such a short time. So now we have tried to get the people as much as possible, but those who could not get a match also we have to be without. Because you should understand that it's very typical to find match for everyone at every age. So this current in it, she has not come I think yet she has been now to be married to Johann de Kauker. Johann de Kauker. Now this Italian lady has not yet come but she is becoming a very tricky Aasthi with Nicholas Grandley.

This is for 21 parts, for every plant. All right? I will be right. APPLAUSE

So we have glass doors. Ladies and gentlemen, respect. You are in for home or I have been privileged many times in my life with no rights in my power just to share that. So we have used you in my research programs and but essentially the case in Europe where such a home would have seen really ridiculously small to receive across rich change and rich. So by somebody who is now in New York, in the summer of 2014, when we partly involved in the program I don't know how to tell you about how I've shaped him. We are a totally professional person and I can't believe that New York people are so insensitive to such an extraordinary event as you're coming in this specific. And I can only blame us for being at the time of the pandemic which was not at all ideal for the purpose. And I can only objectively take a break from all this. I know that for the first time there's been a little bit of a state of thought so if you don't know is what she offers in the program and the political meditation which found them. And I believe in the same, the incredible enthusiasm for this genuine opening of our spiritual potential. He certainly can't be the one that has to look at all this and to share with sense of history. She knows if I need to do for a few minutes or like that too. So to our frontier for the first time, what is to be expected in this program. New York is a city of experience. I think that was sort of understated at the time. New York is a city of high notes and experience. And as a commuter I cross hard and related with other people from my favorite area of the country, the page of the Wall Street Journal. And if I take my notes out of the Wall Street Journal, however I don't really depend on it. I know for the minute I see a lunar world war two long times in a day because the extreme of poverty less than traces on the geography of that part of the city. And the trade that we've got down the road and then there are the individuality of this iron building where some people have made an income of a few hundred million dollars a year. Now people are quite in a certain experience that when they look for the conflict, we lose the roots of our condition. If we look at the roots of our condition, there is each form of a focus tendency. The first corner for western civilization was Greece and their philosophy. And the concept which was central to the concept of armonia, and this is expressed in the aesthetics of Greek architecture and the Bartheon. And it is basically the art of freeing the violence in one's life. Now of course violence, the conflict of experience, violence is where people are needed in the proper order for what purpose should be the violence. This was idea of a bridge, a new dimension to the building plus specificization of the Bartheon. And that dimension is to explain why violence was born, why the extreme of the people in the city of Georgia, where there are extreme circumstances, such as crime on the street, why actually there shouldn't be violence in it. And the explanation is in this chart that you see here, because if I may very quickly introduce the hypothesis that is actually being written for you, this is the hypothesis that this exists and the verification of the hypothesis, which is most definitely the absolutely unheard of and historical dimension of the religious message that the hypothesis is going to be verified. And it's going to be verified here and now. Some amount of talk is necessary for the audience to know what we are talking about, that it is not the key of that program, even that talking is something that everybody can do, and whether we have to do a barbeque, it's an armonia and a conflict of what our knowledge wants and the memory works, that we've been experiencing, whether we're on the post and our nation stand open. Now, where are the extremes to be observed? There is blue channel, there is yellow channel, there is blue channel in Sanskrit, because that knowledge was known by Seattle of the ancient, the early days, is for the dynamic, the channel of the way of the ocean and the other, the subconscious and this yellow channel here is bigger than the other, it is the channel of action and of our mental body and is the other aspect of our psyche. Now, maybe between this genealogy, it's the brain and that's the rate of the brain being left to the left side and that's the rate of the right side. I will not now elaborate on those aspects of our internal system, so I see it to say that the central channel is the one which brings about balance and is the third, the famous third option, the famous synthesis which has been reached beyond these two movements of our attention between emotional and emotional. They are peaceful, very collective and extremely moral by themselves. Nobody had to tell them. Because they were self-lassed, because they had the power of their self. And this is what has to come one day to New York, which is very important. But as this is the financial capital of the world, they say, money becomes more important. And those who can charge money, many people have told me that, that if you start charging money, there will be many more people who will come. But you cannot, because how much can you pay for your self-realization. So the understanding will come and there's nothing to feel upset, because anything that is reality doesn't start with a bang. You can create thousands of plastic flowers, but to create one real flower, it takes time and you have to have that patience. Because Sahaja Yoga is a living process of your evolution. You have evolved into this human state, there's a little breakthrough that is to be achieved. When I came here, this was the first country I visited and that time I was amazed how people were seeking ardently, but how they were misled by advertising, by false promises, and also by using all kinds of devious methods. There was no honesty about it, there's no simplicity about it, and they weren't. At that time when I was talking, I remember I was in Los Angeles and San Francisco, the gentleman who had organized my program told me, that, mother you better take a sort of a copyright. I said, for what? I said, for your lectures, because they'll use their your lectures and they'll put up big organizations. I said, let them, it's a very good idea. It will go to people, it's a very good idea, that they should know there's a new age coming, they should also know this Aquarius age, they should know all about it, there's no harm. I am not interested that I should do it, anybody else can do it, it will be a good idea, because what I'm interested in, that people should get their knowledge, they should get their self-realization. And that's how so many ideas have cropped up. And what I feel, that there's a kind of a guru shopping going on. And people are lost, also they have lost faith. It's unfortunate, very unfortunate, because the people who deserve, who need Sahaja Yoga, live in New York, not in India. In India people are not so tensed up, they are not so upset, though they are poor, but the riches also gives you lots of problems. But when they say that the people are affluent, they go up to a point where they start just feeling what is beyond. There must be something beyond this, this is not the end of it. And that's what we say that after the principle of Lakshmi, that is the wealth, is fulfilling, then the Mahalakshmi is the higher seeking starts. To seeking after money, seeking after power, when it shows its results, when it has an effect on the personality of a person. When they see that the society suffers, every individual suffers, the ecology problem, then they start thinking, where did we go wrong? I met many intellectuals also who study religion, study all kinds of yogas, they know, but nothing inside. They said, we have no power within ourselves that we could really control ourselves. They are taking drugs, they are alcoholics, I mean if you look at them you will not even think that they have read any book. The reason is, the knowledge that we talk about is not a mental activity, it's not an emotional activity. It is a state of your awareness. Luckily Jung has talked about it. That is the state of collective consciousness that is on your central nervous system. I think he has really, clearly mentioned about it, but as he couldn't give realization to people, he couldn't prove it. Though people study him very hard, accept him as a philosopher. This is no question of philosophy, no question of reading. It is something within you, the power. It lies in the triangular bone and it has to be awakened. It's like a premude in a seed which is to be sprouted and for that you cannot put in any effort. It has to be effortless. That is Sahaja. Sahaja means with and germ means born. Is born with you, this right to get this union with the Divine. Now if I say there is Divine power, a subtle Divine power of love of God which is all-pervading, people won't like it because even to take the name of God people don't like it. Because they just think of fundamentalists. But if I say so, you have to treat it as a hypothesis and you have to have an open mind of a scientist to see for yourself. If it is so, let us feed it, why not? If you have that kind of an attitude, then it works. Even if you are an atheist, it works. Even if you are a certified bad person, it works. It may not work in some, but in many it works. And that is the last breakthrough. Just like I would say to make it very simple, like this instrument is here. Unless and until it is connected to the mains, it has no meaning. In the same way we have to be connected to the mains. And once we are connected to the mains, we know the absolute truth. That's a fact. Not because I am saying so, but you will find it. That's that's a fact. As a result of that so many things happen. As you have seen there are six centers through which this power, this vital power, which is in a triangular bone, passes through, nourishes all these centers. These subtle centers are related to our plexuses. This goes up and down. To our plexuses, physical plexuses as well as to our emotional side. As soon as these centers are nourished, we have seen is a fact again that very many incurable diseases are cured. No doubt about it. I am cured without any medicine. The medicine is within you. But that's nothing. That's very simple. Mentally many people have been cured. Also your intelligence becomes balanced, sharper, deeper and you become a dynamic person, but you are not agressive. You are not agressive, but you are compassionate. You are not agressive, but you are compassionate. You are loving. You are beautiful. And you are magnetic. Even a glance of such a person can do wonders. The presence of such a person can do wonders. Now you are a person, a person who has the ability to do wonders. You are magnetic. Even a glance of such a person can do wonders. The presence of such a person can do wonders. Now supposing a person who is a violent person, who has been a criminal, who has been suffering from all kinds of diseases and also he has been indulging into all kinds of nonsensical things which are self destructive. If such a person becomes a beautiful person, why shouldn't we do that? It's just this, something is wrong. Sahaja Yoga going up now. So with this transformation, Indu just changed. But it works our mass. Mass is changed. Now for example in say in India we have 15,000 people in big cities, 12,000 people and they get their realization. But the reason is there has been lot of work done on this life. There have been lots of seers in that country. There have been lot of saints, real saints in that country who have talked about it. Thousands of years back they have predicted about it. People know about it. There is a background. Same about Greece, same about Egypt. There are ancient countries. In that span of time so many people came and talked about it and said about it. Not that America did not have self-realized people. I would say Abraham Lincoln was a realized soul. But he could not talk about these things to people. They would not listen. There were many people who must have felt that this must be told. But the time was not there to talk about it or to write about it. But still it can work out. We need only one Abraham Lincoln to do such a marvelous job. We don't need too many people. So we have to have such people around who will understand this great happening within ourselves. Now the modern Sahaja Yoga, because Sahaja Yoga has been there since ancient times. The modern Sahaja Yoga is the one by which you can have our mass realization. Because the time has come. It's a blossom time. And in this blossom time you have to have your realization. Then one can talk about God. When I came here first I didn't talk about God. A word about it. I told them about all these powers and all that. And many organization has come up. I know of an Indian gentleman who has a very big following here who came to Sahaja Yoga. And he said that I have to start making money out of it. And he has lots of disciples. He has a big ashram here. But it's a pride. But we should not deviate ourselves because reality is the one that is going to work it out. Not artificiality. There's something good about artificiality that it shows up. It exposes itself. And artificial people fight among themselves and it gets neutralized. It does no good to anyone except for feeling somebody's pockets. And spoiling so many people. It doesn't do any good. So it is for us to understand, not to get disappointed. I started Sahaja Yoga with one person. What is important is how deep we go into ourselves and acquire something that is our own. Which makes you an absolute personality. Tomorrow again we are going to have my lecture. So I hope I'll be able to tell you more about it. But today I think let's spend some time in question and answer would be a good idea. Let's see what sort of questions you have. Listen, come this side is better for me as it's just... I said, no, no, no. I was saying the one who has to listen to the question could be on this side to tell me. Yes, sir. Yeah. So... Yes, please. Give me the question. I can't hear you. She wishes to apologize for all the New Yorkers who didn't come. You see, do you think that New York belongs to you? It belongs to me also. Who want you to apologize? It's all right. It's all right, doesn't matter. May God bless you. You see, they... what works in all these places is high technology of advertising. That's what they are used to, conditioning. But they'll come round, don't you worry. Yes, please. You all desire to be killed and not married. For that, mostly say the mind should be beaten and should be silent mind and a meditative mind. Now in Bhakti which I find that you have to exert your will, the moment you force your will on your thinking, then you are making that mind or brain or whatever or thought to make all it dull. That sensitivity, the awareness of the mind is lost. Why would like it if you could just... Yeah. You see, Bhakti that we know of is the Bhakti when we are not connected with God. When we are not connected with God, it's something like we are telephoning without the connection. That's why Bhakti fails. But the Bhakti of a person starts as a Shraddha when he is connected. The difference between the two types of Bhakti you can see in our Indian literature very clearly. Well, Meera is talking here, when will I meet you, how will I meet you in separation? And there are people like Nanaka, there are people like Abhira, who talk with authority. Pachopachisopakara bulau ek ahi doramandau. I'll get all out 25 people and put them onto one string of Kundalini. That authority, like Christ, that authority with which they talk when they sing the praise of God. Like Nanaka says, why are you running to the jungles? God is within you, seek within yourself. That authority when they talk you can feel it that these are the people who are connected. So the Bhakti without the connection has no meaning. On the contrary, it is sometimes very dangerous. In my experiences of the people who have been Bhaktas of this kind, it's amazing that I have seen these centers as we are talking about have deities on them. Now if a person is following a particular deity, say for example we say Shiva is in the heart. And a person who follows Shiva or calls his name, gets a heart attack. You can make it out from the disease he has, what deity he is after. I used to wonder why it should happen, but it's something very simple to understand. That without any protocol, how can you take the name of God? Supposing we have here Mr. Bush as your president. If I go to White House and start shouting, Mr. Bush, Mr. Bush, I'll be arrested. In the same way we have to have a sanction. Without any sanction if you just get after God all the time, talk to God, say, without any sanction if you just get after God all the time, torture him and God saying, God, God, God, God. You get arrested. And many people come to me and say that now see we've been reading so much of Sri Krishna's thing, we are taking His name and we've got the cancer of the throat. Because He remains on the Shri Shruti, you get into trouble. If you find a Christian who is a fundamentalist, he'll have this Agnya, very badly got up, horrible. Because you are not authorized. Whatever is the fact I'm telling you. So you have to have connection with God. If I belong to India, I can ask Indian government for my rights. I can't ask United States government for my rights. Unless and until you are in the kingdom of God, how can you ask for your rights? You have to enter it. So just now as human beings, it's the grace of God that can work on us. But we cannot demand. Unless and until we are connected. And I have seen it out and out. In Maharashtra people are very devoted to Dattatriya, Adi Guru, you see, and that principle lies in our wide here, as shown here. Invariably they all suffer from stomach trouble. So the pestering God like that, without authority, is very dangerous. You see, even to approach a Prime Minister, you have to go through so many channels and to have an authority. Then God is what? He's not in our pockets. That we just take him out, oh God, now come along, tomorrow give me a job, day after tomorrow do this. He's only possible if you are in his kingdom. Then you can say that. Even you don't have to say, he just looks after you. It's a fact. But nobody's going to believe it unless and until you have the experience. Now there are many here who have experienced that. So the Bhakti has to be enlightened Shraddha. In the same way the technique, there was one Self-realization organization here in America, which was the same style as the Bhakti style. When I first came I was amazed that the tongues were cut and the tongues were hanging, just like a dog's, you see, has a tongue hanging down. They couldn't talk these people. I was told that this was done just to put the tongue back for a thing called Kechari, that is in Rajyukha. And it was called as Kriya Yoga. So you have to do the Kriya, you have to do the action, take the tongue and put it back. Now this is artificial. When the Kundalini rises, you see, like a car when you start, automatically all machinery starts working. When the Kundalini rises, automatically the Kechari takes place here, you don't even feel it. But it works that way. Bandhas take place, everything takes place, you don't know anything. When you eat your food, digestion starts, you don't feel your food digested. So it's so automatic, it's spontaneous, it's living. But this kind of a Self-realization is like move the wheel or move the tyre of the car and it moves something of that kind. It's very artificial. We have not been able to see through that so much of artificiality in the name of God is carried on. And then they say, there's no God. If you do something artificial about it, you are not entering into the reality. Now we have many people who are supposed to be in Bhakti. They do all kinds of things, they are smugglers, they are black marketeers, they are killers, they are murderers. You may follow any religion. You may be a Christian, Hindu, Muslim, any, any religion, Buddhist, anything. You can murder anyone, I mean there's no harm. Nobody thinks that it is important that because you are a Christian you can't murder. So there's no binding, there's no power that controls you. But once you are a realized soul you just don't do wrong things, just don't do it. Because all this is artificial. But to accept it we find it difficult because it's a conditioning in our mind that you see if you do Bhakti is all right. All right? You have to have Bhakti but since it's more an entertainment, this kind of a Bhakti is more an entertainment. Real Bhakti is only possible when you become one with the Divine. All right? That means that there is a method to achieve this. Yes, of course. But the truth is pathless. Truth is what? Pathless, it has no way, no, you can't say truth. Because we can't say truth. Who says that? No, that's obvious. I have met persons you see who have never read any book. Yes, of course, there's no need to be. They have no guru. Nothing, I am one of them. I am one of them. I have not read any book, I have had no guru, nothing. I am born like that. No, the logical thing that they say that they are their previous karmas. Maybe. I am born like this with knowledge. So what I mean to say is that the very awakening in those persons. Awakening is always described in all the books. In all our scriptures, awakening is described, even in Koran it is described. Everywhere it is described there has to be an awakening. There has to be an enlightened man. You see, we would say that at the time of Sri Krishna, he didn't talk of Kundalini awakening because that was not the time. But in the 12th century we had Ganeshwara, who was a great, one of the greatest poets you could think of on spirituality, who died at the age of 23 and wrote his Ganeshwari at the age, they say so, of 14 years of age. The whole of Gita is written. In that he has very nicely in the sixth chapter described how you get your realization through Kundalini awakening very clearly. Now, let us take this way also. Whatever is written or whatever is there, today Krishna is not here, today Ganeshwara is not here. Let us see if this is the truth or not. Why to depend on something, the explanation of which we cannot ask? Why not today as it is, I am sitting here to get your Self realization? Than to depend on something which you cannot explain, you cannot grasp. It's always so. As you know when Sri Rama came in India, they said, we believe in Parshurama. Then when Sri Krishna came, they said, we believe in Rama because they are all dead, so it's better to believe in something who is dead, so you can believe into whatever you like. But why not believe when somebody is living? Why not believe when somebody is living? There is no question of believing also, just to get it is your own. If this diamond is your own, why not get it? Why to depend on something? Because somebody has said something somewhere. Why not be achieved? Supposing I say, there is a diamond available here free, not New York, even from Australia people will fly out. We should have the same attitude towards spirituality. Then only it works. Otherwise there are many who are depending on such a thing and have died, depending on such thing, got nothing. Any other question? You got something on as well. Is there something, anything left in? Any other question? Yeah. What is it? What is it? What is enlightenment? What is enlightenment is that within us resides the Spirit, which is the reflection of God Almighty. And when this light, which is within us, which is a witness, becomes enlightened in our attention, then it is enlightenment to put it short. But to explain it fully, I'll need one big lecture. In the enlightened state, a person becomes endowed with inner peace, inner joy. And the attention becomes active. It acts. Acts for the benevolence of others and for the benevolence of the person. So the blessing of an enlightened personality is both ways. It gives benevolence to the person as when, as benevolence to others. This is the minimum of opinion. But in enlightenment, you know what's wrong with you, what's your problem, and also you know what's the problem of others. If you know how to correct these, you can give enlightenment to others. So in the second stage of your enlightenment, you get the power to give enlightenment to others. Unless and until this happens, whatever people may say, I'm this and I'm that, you are not to believe. Even an ordinary policeman has an authority and he has certain powers. So those who talk that I'm this, I'm that, if they don't have power to give enlightenment to others, then it's better not to listen to them. Listen to them. And what does she say? Huh? Of course, of course. Of course they can give. They can give enlightenment, no doubt. Yes? Yeah. That's what you have to know. When you get enlightened, you can give also. It's very simple just to put your hands behind their back and you can get it. Yes, even this putting hands like this, you can get your enlightenment just now. Yes, of course. Yeah? That's good. That's very good. Come and sit here. All right, please be seated. Please be seated. I'll give you just now. I'm going to give everyone, all right? Just now I'm going to give to everyone. You better be seated. I'll give you also. All right, please be seated. Make yourself comfortable. Very good. This is a seeker. All right, that's very good. Should we have enlightenment? All right, that's time. We'll try. We have to take out our shoes just to help me, put both the feet on the ground. At the very outset, we have to know that we have not to feel guilty. We have not to blame ourselves for anything. Nor do we have to think of our past. Past is past, just now in the present. You have to forgive yourself completely. That's very important. Extremely important. And you have to sit with an attitude of a mind that is pleasantly placed towards yourself. Forget about your past, forget about your problems just now. And I'm sure it will work out. If it doesn't work out today, it will work out tomorrow. It works out. All those who have been in Sahaja Yoga, it has worked out with all of them. And they know all about it. It's all right. All right. All right. So, just you have to put both the feet on the Mother Earth, because she helps us a lot. And both the hands towards Me. Before you close your eyes, I'll tell you how we have to help our centers. Of course, it's not necessary to do all that. It works spontaneously. But it's better, I tell you, because when you are connected also the connections can be loose. So you should know later on how today is your Kundalini again to establish the connection. So today I wish I will be able to, I think I should be able to tell you what centers there are, which we have to really nourish and help. So we say that the left hand represents the power of our desire to have realization. So when you put symbolically your left hand towards Me, it means you want to have your Self-realization, your enlightenment. Please don't feel guilty. Please don't feel guilty. Nothing matters. Nothing is important. It works. Put your left hand towards Me and use your right hand for nourishing your different centers. So first you have to put it on your heart. So you have to put it on your heart. So you have to put it on your heart. So you have to put it on your heart. So first you have to put it on your heart, your right hand. Put your left hand straight like that and right hand. Sit very comfortably. There's no need to be in any way uncomfortable. Now this is the center of our heart where resides the Spirit. First. Second we touch, we work only on the left hand side. The upper part of our abdomen on the left hand side. And here is the center of your mastery. Mastery of the knowledge of the Divine. Then you have to put your hand in the low part of your abdomen on the left hand side. Is the center which works out this knowledge in your being. Again we go back to the center of your mastery on the left hand side in the upper part of your abdomen. Then we put our hand on our heart. Then we put our hand in the corner of our neck and our shoulder like this from the front side. And turn our head towards the right. This is the center we catch when we feel guilty. It's a very dangerous center and causes you diseases like angina, like spondylitis, all sorts of diseases which they call as incurable. So you put your right hand, right your head towards your right and right hand on the corner of your shoulder and your neck. Now second thing you have to do is to again put your right hand on top of your forehead and bend your head pressing on both the sides. Bend your head. This is the center of forgiving others. You may say that is difficult but whether you forgive or you don't forgive. You don't do anything, it's a myth. But if you forgive then you don't play into wrong hands. Now you take your right hand on the back side of your head and raise your head, put it backwards, see upwards like this, close your eyes when I tell you. Now this is the center where you have to ask for forgiveness from the Divine but you don't have to count your mistakes. Now then you have to stretch your hand because in the center of this is representative of this soft bone which we had as a child called as fontanel bone area. Please put this hand on top of your head and press it hard. Push back your fingers, put left hand towards Me put down your head and press it hard and move it seven times your scalp very slowly, clockwise. Now this is the center through which the Kundalini comes out and gives you your connection to the Divine. You have to do it seven times now. You have to do it after closing our eyes. I hope you all have followed it and I will be every time guiding you. Now please put your left hand towards Me, both the feet apart from each other and the right hand on your heart. Now first of all don't feel guilty. You should be really pleasantly placed towards yourself. Don't feel guilty. Close your eyes. You can even take out your spectacles because you don't have to open your eyes till I tell you. Now put your right hand on your heart. Here you have to say, you have to ask a question to Me. You can call Me Mother or you can call Me Shri Mataji, whatever suits you. A question very important. Mother, am I the spirit? Ask this question three times within your heart. Mother, am I the spirit? If you are the spirit, then you also become your own guide, your own guru, your own master. So now please put your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and say or ask another question, Mother, am I my own master? Ask this question three times. Now take down your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side, press it hard. This is the center of pure knowledge, knowledge that you feel on your central nervous system. So here I cannot force on you this pure knowledge in your own freedom, you have to ask for it. If you have to have the full freedom, your freedom is to be respected. So please here say six times, because this center has got six petals. Mother, may I have the pleasure of asking you if this center has got six petals. Mother, may I have the pure knowledge? Mother, please give me the pure knowledge, say that six times. Now, raise your hand again on the left hand side of your abdomen and press it hard. As you have asked for pure knowledge, the Kundalini has started moving. And you have to help other centers to open out. So to open out this center with full confidence, you have to say ten times, Mother, I am my own master, please say ten times. Now, the greatest truth about you is that you are the Spirit. You are the Spirit. You are the Spirit. You are the Spirit. The truth about you is that you are the Spirit. You are not the body, you are not the mind, you are not the intelligence, your ego or your conditioning. You are the Spirit. So place your right hand on your heart and here with full confidence you say, Mother, I am the Spirit, say ten times. Say twelve times please. As I have told you before, that you are not to feel guilty because the Divine is the ocean of love and bliss. It is the ocean of truth and joy. But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness and you cannot do anything that this ocean cannot dissolve. So please don't feel guilty. With full confidence now, put your right hand in the corner of your shoulder and your neck and turn your head to your right. Here again with full confidence you have to say sixteen times, Mother, I am not guilty. This says sixteen times. Now, put your hand across your forehead and press it on both the sides and put down your head. Here is the center when you have to forgive everyone. I have already told you that it's a myth that we forgive or we don't forgive, we don't do anything, but if we do not forgive, then we play into wrong hands. So without thinking, without recording, remembering, all the people whom you have to forgive, you just say in a full way, Mother, I forgive everyone from your heart. Not how many times is the point, but from your heart say it, Mother, I forgive everyone. This is the center which always catches in the West and I find it impossible because whenever I see people through, we didn't feel the cold breeze of the Holy Ghost, then I have to ask them again and again to forgive and then it works. So just now why not do it? Now take your hand on the back side of your head and push back your head. Allow your head to rest on your hand and here you have to say without counting any mistakes, without thinking of your past, just for your satisfaction, please say it from your heart. Oh Divine, please forgive me if I have done any mistakes. Now stretch your hand, stretch your hand fully and put the center of your palm on top of the soft bone which you had in your childhood called as Fountain-Eyed Bone area. Press it hard, push back your fingers and move your scalp. Put down your head and move it very, very slowly, seven times your scalp with a big pressure. Here again I cannot take your freedom. So you have to ask for enlightenment for Self-realization. So you have to say seven times, Mother please give me Self-realization. Please give me my Self-realization, seven times. Seven times. Now open your eyes and put both the hands towards Me. Now put right hand towards Me, bend your head and see through your Fountain-Eyed Bone area if there's any cool breeze you can feel it from here, your head coming out. Just see with your left hand like this, not on your head but away from your head. Now you put your left hand towards Me and see for yourself again bend your head. Sometimes you get also hot air coming, doesn't matter, it will all go away. See it, concentratedly you see if there's a cool breeze coming out of your head. Again once more, you put your right hand towards Me, bend your head and see if there's a cool breeze coming out of your head. Now push back both your hands like this and ask a question, Mother is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? Mother is this the Brahma-Caitanya? Mother is this the all-pervading power of God, Slav? Ask any one of these questions three times. All right, now put down your hands. Now those who feel cool breeze in their hands or out of their Fountain-Eyed Bone area please raise both your hands. You didn't feel? All right, you'll feel it. Now let's put it down. Most of you have felt it. Now those who haven't felt also can feel it, it's very simple. So those who have not felt can come and see Me. I'd like to see why they didn't feel it. One man, all of you, those who are new people can also come and see Me. We'd like to see you. Come along, come along, come along. Come on, please come up. Others also should come up, those who are new. No? You are cool? What do you want? Just come and eat. Okay, that's why you came. Come, let's put our hands together. May God bless you. Come, sit down. All right, it's good. There are new people. Now, you did feel, didn't you? Your eyes are sparkling. Now, good, good. Come, sit down. You are an Indian? Are you an Indian? I met you in Delhi, in the Indian International Centre. What's the centre? Indian International Centre. No, the street. I got the animation then. Then you have to work it out now. To work it out. You have to work it out of this good, good. Sit down. Yes, of course, of course, you should. Good idea. Now, let's see now. You didn't feel it. Can you come this side? Now, just see that. Stretch your hands, stretch your hands. Let's see. Who didn't feel it? Master, you went to some gurus or some masters or something. Have you met before? That's it. Just say, Mother, I am my own master. Just say within yourself. Ten times. Can you come some of the sahaja yogis just to see all these people is? Yes. Okay, okay. Okay. What are you feeling anything? What is supposed to feel? You feel, you feel the coolness. How are you? What? What? Right to the left, come on. This is your seeking, you see, wrong seeking, but it will work out. I feel very happy. Now, she's got it. I feel very happy and very relieved. Thank you. Huh? She's got it again. You got it? Good. You got it too. I can see from the smiles. Now, who else? You didn't feel, madam? You didn't feel? Alright. Now any sahaja yogi, can you come this side? You just have to look at her. Now, who else? You didn't feel, madam? You did. Didn't you? You are either sparkling, I can see. What about you? You didn't feel it? Now, who will look after him? Come, you come in front of him. You don't feel cold? You don't feel cold? What is it? Tell me, no? Should be. Should be? Now, don't feel guilty for anything, anything, anything, anything. Alright? Forgive yourself. Forgive, forgive, forgive, forgive, forgive. Ah! Seeker, he's a seeker. Alright, come along. Purindu, you can give Realization? Alright, come along. Look at this lady. You got it? It's good. Left, right, alright. Press it hard. And just one saying, I am my wife. And just one saying, I am my own master. I, this is the worst thing that can. Left, right, right, right, right. Left, right, right, right, right. Left, right, right, right, right. Are you feeling now? Yes, yes, yes. Raise it. Raise it. Raise it from below. Who else now? Here, this lady? Left side. Left side. Alright? Put right to the left. She'll be alright. Now, this gentleman, did you feel? Good. You felt it? Little bit. Alright. Just Seeker, that they feel? Raise it, raise it. Now, one thing one has to know. You have to respect your Self Realization. First thing, you should not be just coming here, you should not be just coming here. No. This connection has to be established fully. Now, we are having courses for this. One people are going to look after you. They are going to tell you how to fix your attention, so that your Realization is completely established. Yes. It should be established in the Nirvikalpa. Right now, you are in the Nirvicharma. You are in the Thoughtless Awareness. But you have to rise to the Self Realization. Can you see her? Hello. You come up and just see her. No, no, this lady. Karleen, just have a look. Yes, she can see. Karleen, you come up. You come up from the back side, or this side, you can come up. Yes, she can look after. Karleen, can you come up? You come up from there. Come from the back side. Now, better? Such a seeker. Karam, Karam, it's very hard. Work hard. Have patience with yourself. Only think you have to have patience with yourself. That's all. If I feel the breeze, if I feel the breeze, you say enlighten me, I will be enlightened. You see, that is the symptom of it, that you are enlightened. When you feel the breeze in your hands and out of your head. That's first the sign, is that now you are feeling the all-pervading power. I feel I am burning. Yes, very hot. I know I am feeling the same. I am perspiring with it. That's heat, too much heat. What to do? What is it, hell? No, it is because, you've been to wrong people. You've been to wrong people, you see. They do harm very badly, I know. Whom have you been? Nobody. Nobody? Somebody you have been to, no doubt. You've been following some method. I've been seeing many people. Many? Not one. All Indians. I've been reading and searching. I know you are a seeker out and out. It's hot, I know, but you're all right. Is this the end of your search? I'll just ask any question. No, no, no. Mother, am I my own master? Mother, am I my own master? Just ask a question. Open it. Ask. Mother, am I my own master? Say, mother, am I my own master? Just ask a question. Mother, am I? What do you ask here? You ask because this is... No, okay. I just ask one question. What do you ask here? You ask because like a computer the answer comes. No, no, here. I mean, when we put here first, here is that... Center of Master. You ask at the knowledge. Yes. And you just ask, mother, am I my own master? I'm out here, sir. If I have my knowledge, why are we asking? What knowledge you have? See, if I put my hand here and I ask my knowledge, so I got my knowledge. So I put it here and now I ask. What? Am I my own master? Why are you going to ask? If I have my own knowledge, I know I am my own master. Because it is a computer that has to work. It's like a mantra. I know, but if I know, I am my own master. No, you don't know that. You don't know. You don't know. Sorry, you don't know. No, no, no, no. You are your own master, but that test has to work out. You have to say it. I am my own master. Mother, I am my own master. Am I? Am I? I am my own master. Very difficult. Yes, sir. Am I my own master? That's what. You got a mind? Yes, sure. Now I've got a great doubt on myself. Don't doubt. You see, doubt is not there. It's so much heat you don't know. I am perspiring with you. You won't get the answer to yourself, the computer will answer. Am I difficult? Yes. Again, please. Again, enough. Again. Mother, am I? Am I my own master? Again. Again. Mother, am I my own master? Again. Mother? Am I my own master? Again. Mother? Okay. My own master. Okay. My own master. Okay.

I would do it. You see, I'm going to Brazil also, I'm getting quite worried. There's a lot of black magic also in Brazil, isn't there? Make partner? Go on. Okay. So now will you try on him? Who is going to try? All right. We'll put you. Steve, you look after him. All right, go. They have to work on you first of all, they have to put you right, then they'll give you a land. Just go. Steve, try on him. They have gone through the same style. Should I move that? Yes, please. Same type. Yes? Horrible.

You ask the question, is this the power that you believe in? Yes, you push this. That power. You ask the question. Ask the question. Ask the question, is this the power that you believe in? Yes, you push this. Yes, again. You push this. Then everyone says. Say it again. You push this. What is the power that you believe in? Mother, is this the power that you believe in? Yes. Have you got it? Felt it, alright. What about her? You felt the power? Did you feel it? Alright, now put your hands like this. You say that mother, please come in my head. I am at your disposal.

So now we are all here in this beautiful place and I'm sorry for this inability to speak about this inadequacy here. They had very little time to do something about it but I've asked them to get something more and if you people help them then they might be able to tie up something more for your protection from the... Are you all right underneath this? You are all very satisfied people. But your all faces are red and I feel terrible about it. What we can do is to after this program, now the program is like this, I'll be here every day, we'll keep it now from ten o'clock but you want to have more time in the sea, that's the trouble is. So if you could little bit reduce it then I could be here by ten o'clock and by eleven o'clock we'll finish this session in this place which is very hot and then you can go and rest in the places where there is some sort of a growth of some trees, underneath that you can rest for a while and then you can have also your food and in the evening this is all right but for the day time I think I should come here earlier, problem could be solved. I think we should change the program if you don't mind. You come here about for your meditation, six o'clock is it all right for you? All right. So six to seven if you do your meditation then seven to eight up to nine o'clock you can finish your breakfast and come here. I'll come here about say eight thirty, we'll have a little talk and then you can go about nine thirty to the sea shore and on the sea shore then you could be there for some time till you come back but come before eleven o'clock, you should not be there for longer period than that but you might get some troubles and then you can rest or if you want you can take your baths after that and work it out and then the food will be served at twelve thirty. So we'll have to change the program. Six o'clock in the morning meditation, six to seven about say meditation then you can have your breakfast seven to eight or seven to eight thirty. I should be here by nine or eight thirty if you want and then we'll have a little talk for some time and then you go to your sea bath and then come back here before eleven thirty, let us put it like that. Then you can have your baths, you can have your baths and you get ready for your lunch, lunch will be at one o'clock. One to two or two thirty will be the lunch hour. After the lunch hour you can go into the shady places and rest there will be better till about four o'clock or four thirty and then you'll have your tea. We are thinking of organizing some games and some social meetings among yourselves. You can meet here whichever way you like about say four thirty or five o'clock if you like. Five o'clock, how can we make? Five. Four thirty to five is tea all right. Four thirty to five, five thirty is tea and then you could just meet each other here and you could have little sports if you want to have anything. Then we start our progress six thirty, night club or anything, garden or just. Six thirty we start our music. I'll I'll come here six thirty. Then I'll speak to you about seven o'clock, we start our music program, end it up by ten o'clock. You shouldn't spend more time than three hours for music. So every day everybody should get a chance to sing. Also morning time you can sing, any time you want to say after breakfast you can come and sing here, you can arrange that for yourself because you are free. Every day you want to go to the sea, sure. Why are you so mad? It's all right once in a while but I think too much going to the sea is also not very good. Going to the extreme sea is not a very good idea. So the leader should sit down and organize it, so the timing is like this. And six o'clock is the meditation that everybody has to do, six to seven, then has to finish it. Then what you have to do is to have a seven to eight, the night. Seven to eight thirty is, now write it down, seven to eight thirty is your breakfast time. You can assemble here for some music for an hour or so, so nine thirty or ten o'clock. Now those who want to go to the sea shore can go, those who want to come for music can come here. Indians don't want, never go to sea shore every day. I think... We can create the sea for you through music. I mean, you are wasting your time like these hours together in the sea. You see, it's all right once in a while. I mean, even if we go to the river Ganges, we don't go every day. One should not do everything extreme, just like as if you have never seen the sea sort of thing, you see. So then you could have some music here till about ten thirty or so. Then if you want to go to the sea shore you can go. In the evening also if you want they can go from four thirty onwards. You are not? Now, so then we'll have music program here. Kuthum pada? By six thirty Shri Mataji... It's occurring. It's occurring from nine o'clock to ten thirty. Nine o'clock to ten thirty, all right. And those who just want to have music can go on having music. There's no need to bother. And sea shore also you go for one hour. What do you do for so much time? There is a waste, waste of precious time. You come all the way not to... I don't want to say that. You have to be sensible. This madness of sea bathing started only I think twenty-five years back. Otherwise nobody is to do that. It's a madness, it is a conditioning. These entrepreneurs have put into your head that you must go to the sea shore. It's just an ego trip, that's all. You must go through the sea and when you go to the sea you see people feel you have spent some money on your holidays so you can boast about it. Your faces have gone red because of the sea. Now you want to become yellow or what to you, brown or what? And then you find for racialism, just imagine. So now then if you want to go for sea shore you can go or you can go and rest there for a while as a place or you can have a meeting and you can talk to people after that, whichever way you want to do. And then the lunch is at about twelve thirty. Twelve thirty till two thirty. It's quite a relaxed time, there's no hurry about. Then you again you go and rest. This time you must rest under some trees or something, wherever you feel like just go and rest for a while. Now you'll have quite a lot of sunshine though I'll try to make it cooler but still. You then can go to the sea shore. Then don't go to sea shore, it's dangerous. You say I don't want you to develop skin troubles coming for your pilgrimage here. You are My wise children, you are not stupid children. Then I would suggest that you rest till about say four thirty, four thirty is the tea, till about five thirty. Then you assemble here, we start our program at six. Did you write it down? And from six, from six we start our program with our music and things. I'll come here for half an hour I'll speak to you, music and all those things. Then it will last till about ten or eleven, whatever it's ten o'clock, if it is better to finish by ten thirty. Then you have your food and sleep off. Then because next morning you have to get up early. But when you get up early you need not sort of do bathing and all that. If you can do it then you have to get up at five. I mean I get up every day at four o'clock, no doubt about it. So if you want to do that way you can do it. We have to remember that we have come here for an ascent and not for fun, one thing, and also not for spoiling our health for a second. So these two things are to be looked after. There should be a kind of a seriousness of achieving that ascent. Now regarding some other things are that tomorrow morning, say for example, after your breakfast we'll first have a sale of saris and things, whatever it is here, sale of things whatever you want to have. And but I would request Indians not to buy just now, let the foreigners buy. I can always get them. The paidana is Apana Jaina. Indians shouldn't buy any saris to begin with. But we couldn't get their hands on many printed saris we wanted to bring because the prices of silk have gone up double so we didn't bring them. But I would request you that you please don't, Indians should not buy any saris or kurtas or anything whatever is there. Just first let them buy the things. Once they are finished with it then it will be all right. Now today is just an introduction so I'm not going to give you a lecture or anything. But one has to remember we have come here for a pilgrimage. We have come here to establish our peace within ourselves and for that we have to work it out with understanding and we have to make a full effort that we become collective and we become more sensible. Our attention should be good and attention should be such that you can absorb the vibrations. I don't have to speak, I don't have to manipulate, I don't have to say anything, vibrations are flowing. It only depends on your suction power how much you absorb. So it is a very simple thing one has to understand. Next year I'm sure we'll make a building here so you won't have all these problems of it. We had to do an ad hoc arrangement you see because of certain people who objected but now it's solved there and that's why the problem has come. Doesn't matter but I'm sure you can adjust to it. So for today's main again problem is the last but not the least are the marriages which are being fixed. And the new suggestions have also come in. Now today is the last day. Now if you try to change after this I will say that please I'm sorry. You see there's so many other things to be done and secondly those who are not yet married, those who are still there who want to get married or those who have new proposals please send them over. If you send them over I'll organize it and I'll manage it. But if you go on one by one, one by one it's very difficult. Now we have already organized everybody's marriages and as you know, where is he going? He's carrying that file and as soon as I see the file I'll laugh. He's poor thing I tell you is, see everybody's saying I don't like this, I don't like that but there's no solid reason. If there's any solid reason for what purpose you don't like it's all right. Have you had your breakfast? Now first and foremost thing I would like to do for the new year I want to give presents to the foreign Sahaja Yogis, Myself. These are general presents but I'll be giving to all the, also to the leaders later on but just now these are general, I hope you'll like them. Anybody can help Me here? Okay, Antonio just come. So there are two types of shawls, one for ladies who are shorter and one for taller ladies, show them. This is for the taller ones. This one is for the men. The name of the shawls is called as Himru shawls. They are made only in the Aurangabad district by hand, woven by hand and the designs are different as much as you think it proper but whichever comes your way please take it. Now don't go on changing them, I don't like this. This word I don't like it, like it has to go out of our dictionary, all right? Now, so what should we do? Should we, how should we distribute? You don't have to get up all of you. All right, you can all get up and come here. Somebody, the leader should come. How are you standing here? You come here. Yogi. No, no, it's all right. Let them come one by one. Let them come no more. The leaders can come here. For the ladies, lady leaders should come here, put them that far and he create him. All the, they put all of them. The tall ladies, you see, should take taller ones with understanding. Taller ones you put it on one side. These are for taller. This is for the tall women and the shorter women are there. I hope you like them. It's pure cotton, that's the point. Come along, come. You don't have to open, you can see from outside. These are all big ones. You see, the smaller ones you get, you comparatively can see from outside. So you see, there are two hundred, how many can you open? These are for men. First let all the leaders have one here, not all right, later on. All right. You can go and distribute them. You can please. Better distribute them, is better right. Or they are about two hundred. Two hundred is another, and they are all together? Okay. Seven times. Shri Mataji. Shri Mataji. To be, Anasangam, Aakdu, Prasad. Thank you. Mumbai is a place of life. Mumbai is a place of life. Mumbai is a place of life. It is a place of life. It is a place of life. Has everybody got the shawls and the, if there are any leftovers, please bring them back. Or if anybody has not got them. Those who haven't, who have got shawls are all right, but those who haven't got. Those who have got extra shawls, please bring them here. There are some shawls lying there. Anybody who has not got the shawls, please come to the stage and take them. All of you have got? No? How can that be? Who called you? There were two hundred and twenty shawls. Who has taken two? Who has three? Is that me or ladies? Right. How many ladies we have? No, there were hundred and seventy-eight for their saris only. Didn't get the saris also? How many you have, you tell me? How many ladies you have? All right. Please be seated. There are at least hundred more. There can't be three hundred, I'm sure. All right, we are trying to find out what has happened. How many men there are? Now two more ladies can have it, whichever is this. Come along. Come along too. They are all coming now, coming more. Galina, Galina, give it to them. All right. All right. You are engaged with Indian girls, can see them and if they want, well and good, if they don't want, they can tell. All right, so we got this. Are you happy now? Two Australian boys are married to them, are to be married. All right, you can go now. All together. That's the girl. All right, we got this. You wanted that. One minute. James Diwali and Jayashree.

The way Yogi is training me, I think he is going to retire next year. I am the only one having a lot of problems. They are all having a marathon race. They are all having relay. Come on. Rajeshree Basheti and Anis Adamopoulos. Am I right? May God bless you. May God bless you. May God bless you. May God bless you. Shri Mataji, people are shorting for Ole.

Who is your boy? Rajamani Amal, has she come? Mumbai Chey? She is from South India. Rajamani Amal. Mr. Jaykar, does that name sound familiar? No, no, no, no, no. She is from Bombay. She is a South Indian, but. Ambarnaat. Ambarnaat Chekute. Ambarnaat leader. Konne Ambarnaat Chehale. Ambarnaat Che leader Konneith. Shri Mataji, please come here. Shri Mataji, please come here. Miss Chibber, please. I was about to announce that the tapes would be for sale, but Yogi has dampened my enthusiasm by saying that he forgot the tapes in Pune. But I am sure it will come, they will come in good time. A little background on this, with the permission of Shri Mataji. The tapes will be sold in Calaway, that's the last halt before you go back home. A little background on this. It was always that Baba Mama made a cassette here or Sanjay made a cassette here and we went and dumped the cassette on you western Sahaja Yogis. We decided that the flow should come from the west. So while we were in England we took the permission of Shri Mataji and Darel, I would like Darel to stand up. Darel, there you are. There is this man, would you come forward Darel, who is also getting married. My sympathies to you Darel. Renu Sharma from Delhi. My congratulations to you and sympathies to you Darel. In exactly 24 hours notice Darel offered all his services including his studio and all the equipment and we were able to complete this recording in 5 hours of time. First I will ask Darel to come up on the stage and I would like you to give him a very big hand. May God bless you. First of all you have seen her. Are you happy? May she bless you. All right, may God bless you. One minute, Darel, please. Then I got our ever willing enthusiastic Jose. Mr. Jose, where is he? Just two minutes. And we decided to choose the songs that would be appreciated by the Indians, sung by the western sahaja yogis. Jose please come here, don't be afraid. And Jose and Kwan were very instrumental in choosing the songs and after that of course the Nirmal Sangeet Sarita was there. So I will call Prabhakar Ravi Dhakare for one minute on the stage. Jose is thinking of making rock music now. And we, they sang, all the western sahaja yogis sang about 7 songs. Am I right, Jose? We chose 7 obviously. And there was one song in that, the Mahalakshmi Stotram, which we thought they were singing in a wrong rhythm. Because it was in a rhythm of 7. So we decided to hammer that rhythm into Jose and his company. And myself and Sanjay Talwar were virtually hammering that rhythm into Jose and his company. And this is an effort. Sanjay Talwar. We had a program at 4.30, scheduled at 4.30, which was about 125 kilometers from where we were recording. And we had exactly 3 hours to finish, or 4 hours to finish. And in those 4 hours, thanks to Jose, thanks to Prabhakar Ravi, thanks to Sanjay, thanks to Darryl and also thanks to Baba Mama. I don't know who he is. This cassette has come out in the grace of Shri Mataji. Thank you. Now we all have to go for lunch. Then you please rest for a while. Till about 4.30, they'll offer you tea. After the tea then it will be about till 6 o'clock. And I'm very happy to announce that such a great master of sitar is that is Debuchadri. We'll be playing, first we'll have other music and then Debuchadri will be playing the last. And I mean it's such a pleasure to have him here. He's such a great Sahaja Yogi as well as such a great player. I mean, I think one day he will cover the whole of universe, the way he plays and the depth he has developed. May God bless you. So I'll take your leave now. Please enjoy your lunch.

As the story begins, Sobh reflexively polls and by accident discusses that God also Charges that, that Jesus only had one background and a future and Skeptics also arrested. crisis since the cycle of ice Jesus believed in helpful creatures Not He only has permission, waters, forests and hills Shri Mataji, of greatness, one after another, there's a big meeting of many great, laminated people and they wanted to decide who is the greatest. So they said the Mother Earth is the greatest because She supports all of us, whatever type we are. They said, what is Mother Earth? After all She is supported by Shri Naga. So what is Shri Naga? After all He is fallen into the neck of Shri Shankara. So how is He great? So they said, what is Shankara so great? He has to depend on Kailasha. So they said, what is Kailasha? Great, because after all Ramana by three arrows has lifted at Kailasha. So what is so great? So ultimately there is the point that Ramana is very great. So then he said, what is Ramana? After all Shri Rama killed him by one arrow. So the saints are greater than all these things. So this is the point of Ramana. So the saints are greater than all these things. So the saints are greater than all these things. So the saints are greater than all these things. So the saints are greater than all these things. So the saints are greater than all these things. So the saints are greater than all these things. So the saints are greater than all these things. We can send a telegram or we can send a registered letter or a express letter and all kinds of communications are there. But in the telephone you just have the direct connection.

The dust at the, let's notice the heat of the, your Guru should be always, should be always applied to your forehead and he says that, the greatest thing you should ask, anything in this world is of no importance, you should just ask that, Oh God, just give me the complete fondness and dedication to the lotus feet of my master. He's aiming at Me and I'm saying, all this is about the master and he says that you are in company of your master. It is, they call it, it is a saint, you know, master the saint. It's a very greatest thing, everybody doesn't get it. It's only your, the Kundas of your last life that you are able to be in the company of your Guru.

So the saints are greater than all these things. She is saying we should get lost into the bhajan of Shri Mataji. She should come in our heart. You should feel that She is in our heart. She is in our heart. Shri Mataji! Shri Mataji! This song means that the name Nirmala is so sweet that it has made Me mad to keep running after My meditation. I mean, I've got the madness of My meditation. I should say quite a jovial person and also he was passing remarks that, look at them, how they are so much in proper percussion while the Maharashtrians are no good. Some people make a clap at one time, another may see it, they do it. He's making fun of that. He's saying that it's like the sea where the waves come one after another, when it starts moving, when a person is sitting on the shore and just watching, he's watching and he gets lost. Just now this is the Eikaswami, the Shri Mataji, the Shri Mataji, the Shri Mataji. The sea of waves, waves are coming of their devotion and I'm just watching and I think I should stop my babbling and better watch all this going on. But Maharashtrians are not so good at getting lost. They are sitting at Maharashtrians. They are sitting at Maharashtrians. They are sitting at Maharashtrians. They are sitting at Maharashtrians. He's a really a learned man, I must say. He's saying that people do not know how the fish can sleep in the water and how it rests in the water. Only when we can be fishes, we can know. In the same way, if somebody has taken some sugar and he enjoys the sugar, then another person cannot say what is the enjoyment of the sugar. In the same way, when they say what is meditation, you cannot explain to them, it is only you have to experience it and only in experience you can enjoy it. You can enjoy the experience yourself. You cannot describe it, you cannot tell to anyone. That's how he's describing and he says that's why all these people have come all the way to take the darshan of Mataji at least once for that to be in her company, to enjoy her company. But if anybody says what do you enjoy in her company, nobody can say. Because it is just to be enjoyed and those who only enjoy can say what it is and if you really want to enjoy what it is, you should take your Atma Sakshatka. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. He's talking about that you all have gone mad. That's in Marathi it's not regarded that mad also. We have all gone crazy to get into the meditation and that we all have gone crazy to get to this joy. So we have come all the way from fifty-six nations here. I have also come from Padratpur all the way here because I have also gone crazy with this. I went to all these places like Loni and all that and there also I got down from the stage and started dancing. So it's something our place, most no one can understand except that you have the experience of this place. He lost all consciousness of his body and he got completely merged into the body. He got completely merged into the whole atmosphere and when I saw her, Pahoni means after seeing Mother, after seeing Mother, Pahoni means after seeing Mother what happened to Me and has happened to all of you as he's saying. That he says once one is lost in the joy of Brahma, Brahmananda, then who remembers the body? That's what he's saying now. He's saying, I am not lost in the joy of Brahma, Brahmananda, then who remembers? That's what he's saying. He's believing Mother, then we'll get a tremendous shock but we'll also get a little shock to Mother. So now again you must be tired and feel it sleepy. You are not lost in the joy of Brahma, Brahmananda, then who remembers? That's what he's saying. He's saying, I am not lost in the joy of Brahma, Brahmananda, then who remembers? That's what he's saying. He's saying, I am not lost in the joy of Brahma, Brahmananda, then who remembers? That's what he's saying. He's saying, I am not lost in the joy of Brahma, Brahmananda, then who remembers? That's what he's saying. He's just saying that he has come from foreign countries all the way here. He's the ideal to be with your Mother, to get complete liberation from all the nonsense that we have been through. That's the main selfishness behind the whole thing that we are doing today and that's how we are here. He's describing a young man who is on the swing and an old gentleman who is thinking of his young age when he used to be on the swing and the old man is looking at him when he's going up and coming up like that and he's just keeping the rhythm with the same thing, with the same rhythm as the young fellow is having his game with the, he's playing with the swing. So suddenly the swing stops and he also stops suddenly. He's going to now give the analogy. You should also see Me to get lost and to just see how She's moving and what's happening to her in the same movement. You should move and enjoy. He's saying that you should try to do it in one movement and not hit each other. You should try to do it in one movement and not hit each other. You should try to do it in one movement and not hit each other. You should try to do it in one movement and not hit each other. You should try to do it in one movement and not hit each other. You should try to do it in one movement and not hit each other. You should try to do it in one movement and not hit each other. I'm just talking here and if Mother had not translated you, you'd never have understood what I'm talking, you'd have thought I've gone off My head and some sort of a, there's a kind of a effect on My head and then he's telling about a man who married a lady from Karnataka and the language was very difficult. So while going in the train, he asked her a question, what is this one? So she said something in Kannadi, that what are you saying? She thought this is the name. The second one he asked, again she says, what are you saying? She thought what is this second name also, what are you saying? Maybe that's the big one, what are you saying? This is the small one, what are you saying? Then the third one, the fourth one, he got very angry and he said, what is it, you are just making fun of Me and he gave her two slaps. So she said, why are you beating me, why are you beating me? So he said, why didn't you tell me before I'm the name of this one is why are you beating me? So this would be the condition of you people if Mataji had not translated all these things, you would have been fast asleep by now and would have thought that this man has gone off his head. Just talking, talking, talking rubbish. Mr. Mure told Me that why don't you come to the darshan of Shri Mataji, better see her and meet her and I got My realization and you'll be surprised that he arranged this program. I have no capacity to say anything in her presence. When I got up, somehow the spontaneously all this poetry came into My mind and I'm just singing what she's put into Me so it is her power that is working it out. Always her love for Shri Mataji Maharaj and respect for him that she sent four hundred statues all over the world for people to see him. Of course we Maharashtrian know that he was a great man and we all worshipped him like a great person but all this has happened because of Shri Mataji and I must say that there would have been in Kashi or even in Mathura people would have finished all the temples and would have put all their mosques but for Shri Mataji Maharaj when he came and he stopped all that and saved us otherwise everything would have become a mosque in this country, that's what he's saying. So, also that Shri Mataji Maharaj was a, as I told you, was a realized soul sash, this is Sakshat Karyote, Sakshat Karyote and he's going to now seek the Povada of Shri Mataji Maharaj. So, that's the Povada of Shri Mataji Maharaj. So, that's the Povada of Shri Mataji Maharaj. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Vision illustrating storing the Dog Okay, hold on. I'm going. Okay. All right. There you go, right there inside. Now I can buy one of those. You're gonna sell it out here? Okay, thank you. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, thank you. I shall. Okay. You want a fly? Aye. Okay. Now, you have to touch Me. Now, you touch Me. Now, you touch Me. Now, you touch Me. You look after them. Okay. And this is for Me. All right, this is better. Start giving, I don't know. I'll just give you. Thank you. I found them and I like them. I thought you'd like them. So, from the start, from there, that's not it. These are one color I would like them. Just be careful with those wires. All right, thank you. I'll give you that. Shove it. Shove it. Give one, this is it. Start from there, yes? Start from the top, it's better. Yes. So, one, two. This is from Mr. Shri Mataji. Oh. He's coming, I hope. Any color you like, any other color you like. He may like a lack of color, he can. Do you like? Just a lack, let's see how it will be. I only. Whatever color you like. Which color? I think the reddish one. The reddish one. I think it's more. Oh, it's much bigger. Much bigger. You'll put it half. Yeah. That one. This is very big one. We don't have this one. We don't have this one. That one should come bigger. Oh, oh, oh. It's possible. Oh. Oh. Thank you. Hey, so good to see you again. Oh, sorry. Oh. Thank you. Oh. Can I have one? Yes, please. I hope you can hear me, all of you. Yes. Your mother has given me great privilege of welcoming you to our house today. For me personally, it's a very, very great pleasure to see all of you in this place. And I welcome you most warmly and heartily. The place we are in is a new creation. It's the creation of your mother. And she has given her love and her attention to everything that you see here, every detail. In fact, I came only when this house was already built. So you are welcome. When she told me the story, she came here once somehow. And you know her vision. Only she could have that vision. I could not have had it at all. She came to this place. There was nothing around. But she said, this is the place where we should have a house of our own. And from then on, she organized everything. And you cannot imagine that. She organized everything. And you cannot imagine the details to which she has gone in developing this place. As you see, this has architecture of different kinds. It has been architecture from the east of India, from the west of India, north of India, south of India. And indeed, it has now everything from all corners of the world. If you see the furniture which has now arrived, which again she picked from different places, painting and so on, all together it has now become a sort of a universal house of Sahaja Yoga, house of peace, house of love. And I welcome you from the bottom of my heart to this place. You know perhaps that in India, a guest is equated to the God. Because you never know in what shape God arrives in your place. So you are all symbolizing the same divinity. You get from her, but you symbolize the same thing. And I welcome you in that way. You know I have sometimes addressed you in other places and said, when I see you I feel it's an engraving of angels. And I mean it. It's not a formal statement. And what a wonderful thing it is to have in your own house the angels of the world coming together. I thank you very much and I welcome you here. I hope you have, you will enjoy the place. This is in fact not my house or her house, this is our house, this is your house. We always regard this as a place of your own. It is your, we know that we have your love and affection, but the place truly belongs to all of us. And this is how we want to see the world. I know you are waiting for lunch so I won't take too much time. But I do want to tell you that the world has, I am sure you read in the papers, the world has now two elements. There is a troubled world, there is war-shattered, there is conflict, there is tension. And there is another world. And the other world is this world here. A world of love, of peace, of hope, of goodness. And this world is being created by her. And it is my prayer that this world should move ahead. And I have no doubt that it is moving ahead and it will take over the other world. As you know now, the two superpowers, the Americans and the Russians have come together as never before. Why has that happened? You think of it, she went to Soviet Union only about seven, eight months ago. What a marvellous change has taken place in the whole of Eastern Europe. The Soviet Union is no longer what it was, Romania is no longer what it was, East Germany has merged with Germany. Complete change has taken over. So a big change is coming in the world and I think you should take great hope from that. What you are doing, you are creating now new vibrations and they are reverberating in different parts of the world. A big change is coming along. And it doesn't require a great seer to see that the world is taking it all for a bit. I hope and pray that your divine endeavours will not only succeed, will cover the whole world with love and peace and Sahaja Yoga. And the gathering that I see here will become a global gathering. Many shall gather in the whole round of the world. So once again with this hope and with this message to you, the message of great hope, great encouragement, I welcome you here again. I thank you very much. It's a great honour actually to see all of you in this house of yours here. I think I welcome you on behalf of everybody because I thought that it's your house, your own house here. Please enjoy and have a very nice time. I thank you again for giving me this chance to welcome this gathering of angels in this house of love and peace. Thank you. Thank you. I would like on behalf of all the Sahaja Yogis who are gathered here, thank you for your most kind and gracious welcome. It is a wonder that we have heard you many times addressing us and every time you manage to move us very deeply. This is a feat which usually escapes repetition of speech and this is a greater wonder after the so many years that we have hoped that this other world you are talking about, the world which is not a Sahaja world, we have hoped that at some point it will join us and you in a sense as a fatherly figure to all of us and as somebody who has been eminent in this other world, you with your understanding and your vision, give us hope indeed that that joining of these two worlds you mentioned will take place by the grace of Sri Mataji. And for all these years you have been in that sense such an encouragement and a comfort and a fatherly figure to all of us inspiring us and giving us confidence that yes, at some point people in the world will also take us seriously. And I think that the auspiciousness that you bring in all your speeches, your addresses towards us, is the auspiciousness of that other worlds who will gather to the notice feet of Sri Mataji whenever the Divine will deem that the moment has come. So again, I'd like very from the heart also to thank you for this most gracious welcome in Pratish time. Thank you, sir. So now for the lunch. I think we shall start moving from this end and there is arrangement for everyone so all of you can sit.

Then how was the music and then about the marriages. It's done very sweetly in their own, I should say, local style and it's very clear-cut. I hope you will note it down and you will be able to sing next time when you come here.

Lots of applause. BLOGS Applause. Applause. Applause. Applause. Applause. Applause. Applause. Applause. Applause. Applause. Applause. But also in every expression of every artist here, I could see the divinity was between them. I was so enamored, I don't know how many times I have been to see them, I am so glad. Couldn't understand how they were studying all of us within ourselves to see the great character of Shri Rama and Shri Rama. They created such a great benevolent thing as described by the subjects. I wish one day Rama Raja will come to this beautiful place. This has tremendous effect, this so-called drama, not a drama but I think it's telling inside. It's definitely one way it's terrible. I don't know how their reception is in the wider world, I don't know, this country is becoming westernized and stupid. So I request you all of you who are from here, from so many countries, to see the depth and the divinity behind all this and try to integrate them whatever is possible in your own country so that these arts that's all over the world and people see the great in our nation of Shri Rama. Actually instead of they bound to Me, I bound to them for producing such a great digital drive. May God bless them. And also I would like this to sub of this institution of taking such care and such australizations and I have quite uh... I've been interested in drama as in, I used to also write plays and I've seen the dagger organized so well continuously because of how an heart has done, the season is clear how beautiful it was done but at that time the ar120 is something tremendous. May God bless for all of you. Thank you.

It was really another great evening for all of us and people are so creative, I'm surprised the way they brought up such a difficult subject, controversial to so many theories already established. So, you have seen how people can really understand now Sahaja Yoga better through the media of a theatre because to talk like this in the public is an impossible situation because they would never accept such a theory of a Kundalini coming as a serpent. But with this kind of a drama I'm sure one day it will go into their heads that they need transformation wherever. I don't know how to thank all of you, specially those who acted for bringing out the beauty of such a subtle and a difficult subject. I knew what was on what they were doing it. When I saw the snake I knew what it was. But still, I must say I never expected such manifestation of the beautiful ideology, I should say, beautiful reality, which people don't know. I'm not prepared to go beyond their rational mind to understand. But if the priest tell them or if a mullah tells them or if a Buddhist tell them then they're willing to accept. But if Sahaja Yogis tell them the reality they should accept. Because first they'll have the experience, once they have the experience then they will believe that this is the reality and this is how things have worked out. Perhaps I've not written about it in my book or nowhere because they will put me into court, I think everything they have come to know about it. But the way you have done it is really so convincing, so beautifully convincing to people that we should take it out wherever possible, maybe I'll try, somebody in India might try from the television, maybe. If they have some courage they might do it. Now as it is, times are very vibrant and many things are happening at this time, you can notice that so many things are happening because they have played with the ignorance of people and cheated them and miscarried them. But you know the reality, you have had the experience and you know what you are capable of, what you can do. I would just suggest that you are not alone like Adam and Eve, you are so many and you won't suffer like the saints have suffered. On the contrary you will get a great joy in giving realizations to others and talking about Sahaja Yoga. That will be the most enjoyable thing for you, remarkable for you and Eve is a great satisfaction for me. You have to go round and spread the news that the time has come for you to have transformation. I'll give you an example what things are happening. Like in Turkey, we had a big earthquake and there not a single Sahaja Yogi got any, any problem. Their houses were safe, the things were safe, all such Sahaja Yogis are safe. Today I receive a letter from a girl who was travelling by this London train which met with the accident. The parents have written to me that she had my locket and at the time when the train just bumped into each other this girl actually was not sitting on the bench as such but she was looking at something. As a result she never get that jumping or you can say that blow and she said that she was just driven to the door before the fire started and she's safe. Many people who are under attack will be saved, there's no doubt about it and many people who are to be destroyed will be destroyed. But it's not the human beings that will be destroyed but the wrong concept under which people have been tortured, troubled, imprisoned, mesmerized. All those concepts will be exposed and that will show that really the Satya Yuga has started. It is a very great time you are born that you could all get your realization and you could enter into this eternal life of truth. It's something very fortunate on your part and fortunate for me also that I met you all and that you all came along and understood me. It's difficult to understand a person like me because I say controversial things but still you accepted it because of your experience. So tomorrow I'm going to tell you what is the job of a Mahakali and you'll be amazed how you are blessed by this Mahakali power. As far as today is concerned I must congratulate all of those who have made this drama so wonderful and so successful. It's something very, very well done and also the way you have made the stage and everything is remarkable. You have worked very hard and say the English are known for their dramas, very good dramas they used to make, not now but they used to make I would say because now I can't see some of the dramas you are having there. But such nice dramas you had and such sense of acting and rendering different scenes you had. All that is was with your speciality and today I see the English coming round, how should say, the British coming round and showing such beautiful sense of acting and sense of production of the whole theme which is so difficult. The way it was brought in I don't know. Anybody would congratulate you for that. As far as I'm concerned I'm really amazed how you could achieve such a difficult task. So all My love and all My blessings to you all. I must say for Pawar also that he came all the way because I said he must come and he was in a very unhappy mood when I met him. But I'm sure one day he'll prosper now very well and how he worked hard to express himself in different beats, talas, different beats, in different ways. Of course now you all have started understanding these complicated things like our Indian rhythms but they are very rhythmic and they are not only rhythmic but they are very systematic and scientific and they all have a great meaning. So I'm very happy that you all have enjoyed that dancing very much, we encouraged him and next time he says he'll bring some lady who is also dancing with him so we'll have some other dancing also. As it is tomorrow's time we have to fix for the puja. I said about two o'clock we'll be all right because we'll finish by, I hope, by seven or eight because it's not so very cold but it is becoming surprisingly this time it was quite sensible, the nature has been very kind and tomorrow if anybody wants to meet Me or see Me can also come about say twelve o'clock and all the leaders also can come and see Me tomorrow at twelve o'clock. I hope that suits you all. I don't know how much to say because I'm really overwhelmed by the production of this beautiful drama and the music of power. I mean I wish him all good luck and I'm sure he'll show his delicate sides also and also his creativity in a much more fragrant way. Though today he has worked very hard, I must say I never expected he was in such an happy mood but he's done so well. Then also this thing that he has trained Sahaja Yogini's. This idea came to me I know it, I just felt that if I tell him he'll take it up but he took it up so well and all the girls were dancing so beautifully. I thought the Brindavan has come here or what? The way they danced in such a good rhythm and everything. It was very surprising, very very surprising how these girls who never had training in Katha or in Indian dancing or in Indian music did so well understanding the importance of rhythm and also of the, sorry, I don't know, anyway, you see I get lost with English language sometimes but I should say it was the theme, theme of the subject. What the theme has to be expressed but the complicated rhythm is such that you should know how to come to the first one that is Samas we call it. It's a very very difficult thing but the way you have understood the point and the way you are doing it, I mean I can't believe it really because I used to think that when I went to London I felt the girls are walking like horses, like this. All their hair, they had, you see, small hair and they used to jump like this. So I said, how can these girls ever understand the delicacy of rhythm? But not the black people are not like that. Black people have seen, even if they are going for a funeral, they feel dancing with the tune, you know. But in England I was surprised because they are so fond of horses that I think horses had a great influence in their way of life. But now I think it's gone, it's not so much, it must change the way the girls did the dance very very graciously, very delicately. I must say what a transformation and what a beautiful drama of the whole thing. So I must also thank our gentleman Mr. Sukhwinder Singh. Sukhwinder means the one who gives joy and he is really very joy giving. I didn't know he could play with a Kathak dancer, I didn't know, I had never seen him before with Pawar or anyone. But he has told Me that he does play. I was very happy because he is a very good player, very rare and one day he'll become a world famous player no doubt. Then the other gentleman who played on the Santhura also was very well accomplished I must say. Though I think I've heard him before or I've seen him before, face sounds familiar but he's very much synchronizing with the whole thing and it's very surprising. I've never seen any Santhura player playing with the dancers. At the most a harmonium fellow could be there singing but never a Santhura player and he brought all the deficiencies of a singer in his play. It was, you never felt missing that singer or a musician behind. It was so well done. I congratulate him also with all the rest of them and may God bless them and give them long life to entertain the whole world. May God bless you all. Hope to see you tomorrow at two o'clock. I hope two o'clock will maintain the time, all right. Tomorrow there is only brunch so I think we can manage. Thank you very much, thank you all of them. Thank you. Thank you.

That in Sahaja Yoga we really never want to force anybody to marry anyone. Of course we see two different aspects of your personality and then accordingly we try to choose. It's a tremendous task. If we receive all the information in the beginning of the tour it's much easier but this time it was very very late even in Kannapur we are receiving some information. One or two cases it's all right but most of them were very much delayed and so we had to take our time to decide. As a result you had very short time to know each other and to understand. But it's not an arranged marriage in any way. You are all free to say no even now before you start thinking beyond moments. So please if you don't want this marriage please decide now full time has been given to you. I give you ten minutes to decide. Now marriage is not a joke in Sahaja Yoga. It's not so serious also. Marriage is not the end of Sahaja Yoga. I have seen that western mind is like that but the eastern mind is that before marriage they will ask ten questions. What is the boy, what is he doing, he has parents or not, is that's the style they are. Then you find out how are you pleased, what are you doing, is that, all that you will find out. But after marriage must have accepted even if it's a hippopotamus they don't mind. They try to carry on. They might fight but they carry on. They don't say we have divorce. So it's a different type of a marriage that before the marriage you try to verify. Sometimes they go too far which hurts people like how much is your pay, what is your degree because that's what we find out in India. What is one is earning, what is his degree because here every person is a graduate in India practically in our case. So if you are not a graduate then according to them I mean it's low. That's their idea. Though the graduates are starving they have no jobs, nothing here. But supposing there is a garbage cleaner in England he is better off than many graduates you see. But he is a garbage cleaner then in India is no good. So it's not they have understood the dignity of jobs so far. So that's a little difference in the character, in the thing. He is generous but I am explaining to you. But after marriage they settle down and try to work it out. My experience is that the western boys are extremely fine, extremely fine to eastern girls very much. Sometimes go to another limit of spoiling them. And also the western girls when they marry Indians are extremely nice and sweet I must say, both people. Are extremely nice and gentle. I don't know what happens. But when they marry among themselves then they start working out on their western side of adjustments. When they marry among themselves then they say we have to work it out, you have to see for yourself, you have to judge it and all kinds of things they say. Which is something you should give up. Because I think both the persons have the same conditionings and then it becomes like conditioning raised to power seven. And then they start to see getting each other, he is like me, he sits and sees like that and he is giving up. So this combination was better in a way between the Indians or the eastern and the western that's true. But still also among each other you have to understand that in Sahaja Yoga marriage is very important and the children you will get will be all realized also. They will be saved from many of the troubles you have gone through for your ascent. And also they will be much more alert and the conditionings will be much less. But if you continue with the same conditionings when after marriage you start on that, it should work out. It's not something that you are cooking, you see, like that. It works out, it just works out. You shouldn't think like that. Because of the operating people don't have that sense that marriage is once more. Just like as you have a child, you have a wife or a husband, you don't have to do that. Because there is no love for us, there is no love. Under doubt, even if they have, they lack gentleness. You have, they are very gentle with Indian wives, I have seen that. Very gentle with Indian husbands. But with each other they are not that gentle as a patient. The gentleness is very important, how you touch a person, how you talk to that person, how you look after the respect of the other person and also see what that person likes. As you try to please Me, you should try to please each other. It's not very difficult. There is no question of thinking that there is some weakness in Me that's how people know. Such always have to be pleasing people and you have to be extremely gentle. Especially the first few days you should try to control yourself a little bit. Because in first few days I think all the fumes just burst out. And these few days makes the difference. So, now had so many experiences that the first day of the day they will start saying, I don't want you, get out, I hate you. They must have got this dialogue from some cinema I think. But it is not reality. In reality you are waiting for this moment. You are waiting for your bride to come in, waiting for your husband to come in. And that's the moment you must show the maximum amount of consideration and love for another person, not for yourself. Like, I like this, I want this. If you start like that, then it is self-centered. But what you like, what sort of food you like, all such questions, gently. You see, if you start gently it will work out very well. Everything that starts gently works out very well. So, not with the bombastic words or big boasting, nothing. You'll be in a very humble, sweet manner. And even if somebody says something, try to avoid it and say, oh, it's all right, it will work out. So that it should be. Now, another thing is not to discuss your past. Your parents and this and that, to discuss with somebody is, I think, is a emotional blackmail. You should not at all discuss your past or about yourself. Tell anything to the boy or to the girl. If they ask you also, it is wrong. Nobody should ask about the past of each other, because we believe in the present. So you should not in any way ask for the past of the person or tell about your past. Just forget it. Start a fresh new. Say, I have to wear this saree. Then I just decide I'll wear this saree. I don't think which saree I wore day before, before, before, before. But this is the one I have to wear, finished. I mean, it's something very simple also in that we don't do. So in such a serious thing like that, that is marriage, serious in the sense is very deep. But it should be taken as a plane to be enjoyed and it's like this, you have everything but you can't take it. Because there's no love, there's no understanding. And even if you have love and understanding, you don't know how to express it. That's what it is. Because if you can love Me, you can definitely love somebody who is so dear to you. But you have no understanding as to how to express your love. And that's what I think is better that you meditate now about instead of thinking of what the faults you are going to find in others. Because everybody has faults and there should be no inter-ordination about it but there should be understanding. Also take your self-worth. Right. Don't start also introspecting yourself. Unlike the self-conficient business, nothing is needed. It's all nonsense. In Sahaja Yoga, if you are like this, like that, how will you get your realization first of all? And all of you are saints, so you must respect each other. Respect is very important and understanding and love. Goes with the boy. Oh. Now in this one, whatever is there, you have to understand what it is. I will get some Indian ladies also to help you. Ask them to make you wear all these things properly and for the boy. Number 30, Martin Kirchbaumer from Austria and Sylvia Reinhold from Germany. 31, Christian from France and Victoria from United States. 32, Arita Bramini from France. Number 37, Nothin Berg-Peter from Belgium. And Sam Gita from Madras. Finland. Oh. Number 56, Bédistine from Malaysia and Parvati from Malaysia. Number 7, Jirko from Czechoslovakia and François Srouchi from Belgium. Just here at the beginning, Rachin, I cannot read the name. Agarvat. Agarvat. And Fiona Middleton. This is number 58.

Now we can sing all together? I don't hear anybody's voice. Heya Adi Ma Heya Anti Ma Ya Ma Ti Cha Akashatu Shishirataya Madhumasatu Ya Ma Ti Cha Akashatu means I'll explain to you. You got it all? Ah good. First learner. Ya Ma Ti Cha Akashatu. Ma Ti Cha means the dust. You know the sky and the horizon right? Soil. Ya Ma Ti Cha Akashatu Shishirataya Madhumasatu. Madhumas means sweet. The mother is very compassionate, big heart, like in a big sky. Then, Dene Jarit Itukeshiri. Dene Jarit Itukeshiri means she has given us so many blessings. Pari Adi Jana Dupaarakari means those who sincerely worship you. You give them realization. Ya. Then you say, Aparadhami Apakarami means, Aparadhami means most of the time I make mistakes. You have to say that, I make mistakes. Apakarami, I do good things, I make mistakes. But you forgive me. That's the meaning. So everybody ready now? We can, ah? Hey Adi Ma. Hey Adi Ma means? Adi means primordial mother. Adi Ma, Anti Ma. Like Adi Shakti, Ma means mother. Anti means the ultimate God. Ultimate. Hey Adi Ma, Hey means? You are, you are the primordial Goddess. And you are the ultimate Goddess. Ya. Right. It's a good song. Somebody in Bombay wrote this. Jitendra Abhishekhi. Have you heard Jitendra Abhishekhi? He wrote. The other guy wrote it. No, Damle wrote the last stanza. I see. Damle wrote the last stanza. Mother played this song very well on the harmonium. So when she comes down maybe, Mother likely to come down? Not for a few minutes. No, alright. When she comes we'll ask her to play and we can all sing. Ya. We can sing, ah, where is current? Current. Can we sing the Aarti? Shukarta we can. But can you sing Shabakarju? Ya, we can sing in the form of Bajani or Shabakarju. Yes. We can sing. It's too full. We can sing shukr Clan. No? We can sing in the form of Bajani or Shabakarju. Yes. We can sing in the form of Bajani. Yes. Yes. We can sing. What? There is a break. You mean tea break? No tea break. No tea break? Yeh. Sheesh. What is this? Parsh... Mommy is there and Mathaj is there. And what about you? He is here. Everyone is here, alright? Good. You have that. I think I am making it. I have that. Yes you have that. Huh. So you all have been enjoying a lot, eh? That's good. Now today's meeting was very successful, I should say. The lawyer got his realization, everything has worked out. I, today's lecture was good I think about our culture. In general I told you what is to be done and how to achieve it. Am I? All right, I'm sorry. All right. Now, I've been trying to find out why in the West Sahaja Yogi after realization catch from others. Not in India. Now the difference is like this. We don't know what catch means. Supposing you get pain from somebody else or you feel pain on one finger. I feel it quite a lot. If you feel the pain in your head, you feel the pain in the stomach or you feel the pain on your fingertips. Then of course it's a serious matter. But even if you feel the heat and the cold, also one has to think about it. If you feel the tingling, still you are not catching. You are like a barometer. You are just feeling what is wrong with the other person. So if it is heat, that means it is the right sided problem, the physical problem. If you feel the cold, it means the left sided or the tingling. It means the left sided problem. But could be on the right or left, could be anywhere. Could be a combination. But now you are feeling it. But you reach a stage here very easily, I have seen, that you don't feel anything that you have got. You don't feel anything. But what happens actually is that you accept the suggestions that come from the catches and you become them. That's the real catch. But a person doesn't feel anything, cannot feel his ego, cannot feel his superego, cannot feel his chakras, then a person is really caught up. Such a person may feel the catches of others but not of his own. Then you are caught up because the ideas of catches are working through you. And this is a very common phenomena. You ask the friend, she says, like this, how are you? Understand anything you like. You ask anyone according to the nationality and the style, they all say they are wobblies. That's truthful, that's honest. But it's not good. Everything truthful need not be good. So I was wondering what's the matter. And today Dr. Walikar gave me a very good point. He told me they are not steady people to begin with. In this best people are not steady. The roots are very light. And also the people who come from India, many become like that. So they are unsteady people, like the trees with, or you can say the plants with very small roots. So the wind comes, they go to the left or to the right. The roots are taken. So there is no depth. That's why it happens. It can be any way. It can work out any way. Say it goes to the ego, you start cheating yourself at the extreme. Or you start shouting, you start saying things in a way that you should not say. Is Michael here? Is Michael here? No, they are there. All right, come and sit here. Sit down. And then a person, he never wants to get out of it. He doesn't want to get out of it, especially if it's an ego. He will shout, he'll scream, he'll intimidate others, he'll be jumping on the person, doing all kinds of things. But he will not try to get out of it. That's one thing about ego, the biggest problem is, he never tries to get out of it. At worst he will try to cheat himself, or she will try to cheat herself very nicely. Always try to tell, oh, I'm happy, I'm all right. You are all right, but others are not. Because ego aggresses others. So a person who is aggressing doesn't feel the burn, or the hurt. And goes on like that. Actually such a person has to get into a very big turmoil or a very big problem, or a very big hit to get out of it. It's not easy. After, after all, after Realization, you should start seeing your ego clearly. If you are still shouting one thing, if you are particular about time, that's a sure and certain sign of a very big ego. Throw away your watches. Just throw away your watches. That's one of the ways I've seen people assert their ego. Start now, this, that. So what? The speediness, the exactness, you must do this by this time. It must finish at this time. We had one horrible fellow who came with Me to America first time. I had a bad time with him. Then we sent him by another ship. He was an ambassador and this and that. And very particular about finishing the program at nine, but I would start it at nine just to tease him and finish at one o'clock. And then we threw him out. Absolutely he was such a useless fellow. We got fed up with him. He has said, You are a liability, you are good for nothing. Get out of such a... And then you know what happened, he was such a frightened man. I don't know what happened to him. He was telephoned to Me that the customs came to him. I don't know how, why customs went to him. I never knew what was happening. Custom people came to him and asked him if he had smuggled some things. And he was shocked, you know. I said, No, how is... He said, You better come to the police and tell them at the customs that I never smuggled anything. But I said, Sir, you never smuggled a question, but you never travelled with Me, you came by another... But still you better come, please, I beg of you, please come and tell the customs. But I said, How are they asking such a stupid question like that, that you have smuggled something? So I said, All right. I mean he was so humbled down, so humbled down because all his reputation was at stake. So I went with them and I asked them, What is the problem? They said, No, you just don't come into this. This man has smuggled diamonds, you know, for definite. I said, How can you say such a thing to such a man? He was My husband's boss once upon a time, such a big man like him. He also contested election for presidentship in India, you can imagine. And he wanted Me to certify that he never smuggled. So I said, What makes you think that way? He said, We have got reports from Hong Kong bank, we've got reports from Los Angeles that he purchased diamonds in Hong Kong, he took them to Los Angeles and he gave them. Actually he came by another ship, so I did not know. Then I discovered that on the other ship, when he was traveling, he was very egoistical, he was very good at it, he was very good at it. He was a very egoistical fellow, troubling everybody, getting after the cooks, getting after this person, I must have food at this time and that time. So then I discovered that all the crew had decided to throw him overboard. And they planned it very well to say that he got drunk and fell off. That they can do very easily, all of them. But then I think they saw My photograph in his room and all that, so they stopped it, they did not do. When they came back, they did all this mischief to inform the customs about him. But actually he was harassed for months together and then I discovered it and I saved him out of that. He was harassed. And they gave exact date when he arrived, when he came, when he went to Hong Kong, everything into such details that I didn't know. And they joined hands with the ship by which we had gone. Because he troubled everyone with his time, with his, eight o'clock means eight o'clock, I want to have food eight o'clock. And the ship people got angry because this was a ship which was a, what you call, a merchant ship and we were allowed to go as travelers because we, my husband being the chairman was, we got the owner's cables, in that he travelled. But he tried to show off so much that he said that I must give him my room and he should stay in my room. Captain said that we can't do because this is the owner's wife, because of her grace you are here. But he fought so much I said better give, but Captain wouldn't. And I did not know even our ship had decided to throw him overboard. So now, but it was impossible for Me to take him out of his ego because he would not realize it. Very hot tempered man, used to intimidate people, get to shout at everyone and first of all people got frightened, but you know ship people are very different types and whenever he passed through this to behind him say like this, I would say I said, what are you doing all this? All of them, nobody had any respect for him because he had no respect for anyone. And then this captain came and he told Me that we hated that man from the bottom of our heart. He had showed no respect to you also. I said no, no he was respectful to Me, but he showed no respect to us, you were so kind, you were so compassionate, you were so respectful, you were so nice and this fellow was trying to show off so much that we all hated him because he had no respect. He has traveled all over the world, he was an ambassador, this thing, that thing and this ego comes up on such people. All right, forgive them for that, but they cannot come in such a way. Such people are prohibited to come in such a way. So we have to understand first of all we have got in ourselves a tremendous type of ego which keeps us away from reality, there's a big gap. Here is reality, it is yourself here, you cannot become one with the reality because in between lies this horrible stuff called ego, which intimidates everyone, makes everyone miserable, cannot get out of it because it doesn't make you miserable at all. I feel happy also. Egoistical person is always very happy because he can dominate every person. He dominate his wife or dominate her husband, do all kinds of things to dominate and enjoy it and satisfy themselves. Oh, very nice. This is what the whole of the West did. Once upon a time they went round up to China, imagine, they went round up to all the places that was possible, tried to dominate. Thank God, Columbus missed coming to India, otherwise he would not have seen Me here. He would have killed all of us and put all the Spanish and then on top of that all the Portuguese and all kinds of few people would have been there in India and we would be somewhere dead permanently. As they have finished the race is here, do you know? We are enjoying on the graves of these people with the ego. How can God forgive Americans for that? What have we done? Do we deserve to enjoy all these things? We are plunderers actually, if you think so. Real plunderers coming to somebody's land, occupying it nicely, sitting there in a cult of power, thinking no end of yourself, stupid as we are. We are thieves, we are thugs. They can advantage of the simplicity of these people, but God doesn't forgive such aggressors. That's one big problem. With that thing in you, you cannot be deep. As soon as you'll go deep you'll see this. You don't want to go deep because you don't want to face your ego. As soon as you go deep you see your ego and you go into left Vishuddhi, finished. But after realization you can go down with complete confidence that we are going to see our ego nicely, of our food, see our ego nicely, of our forefathers. You are the only ones who can save the souls of these horrible people who came on this earth, on this side of the earth and killed so many Indians. You are the ones who have to do it. Otherwise all these souls will become worms or something in the hell, I think, I don't know what they can become. There's a big responsibility and in that responsibility you should become deeper people. I've seen ego is such, even in Sahaja Yoga we have had people who made money out of Sahaja Yoga with their ego. What's wrong? They can't forgive themselves all the time, there's no problem on that. But they can't forgive other people. And I tell you it's easier to cure a person who suffers from left side than to cure a person who suffers from right side. Because the left-sided person feels the pangs, he gets the aches very badly, he behaves like a mad person, he gets muddled up, he gets cheated, everybody dominates him, he becomes miserable. So the left-sided person can be easily cured. But always the right-sided person will say, I'm left-sided, he's not. And that is why one should understand that ego is to be faced openly, clearly, with bravery and see to it that this ego goes away. But people have never talked about it in the West, about ego, I think. It's a recent talk, nobody talk, because if I read Sathran, who was a recent philosopher, if I read this horrible fellow Steiner, he's a recent fellow, even in the advertisement they say, oh, what a great thing it is to smoke. So nobody recognized it for a long time. But in India it was recognized long, long time back. So they said, oh God, give me everything, but not the stupid ego. From very childhood they are taught ego. We cannot say many things which you easily say, like I hate you. Just cannot say. Only think of yourself, who are you to hate? Hatred is a disease, and how can you have that disease? Keep your eyes open. Hatred is a dirty things, like eating filth. How can you say, I am eating filth, do you say that? That's how we have learned not to say, not to think. If you hate someone, if you go and tell your mother, I hate such a person, she'll give you two tight slaps on the face, no argument, nothing. That is how in India people are very deep people. They may not be so fluid, they may not be so sophisticated, they may not be so clever, maybe everything, but in evolution part they are much higher, because they have very, very deep roots. Once they find Sahaja Yoga, once they come to it, if they are not Westernized, that's a very big if. They take to Sahaja Yoga so easily, they never catch. I've never heard of anybody by catching, like that. Means they catch in the sense that they are like barometer, barometers or they give barometric reading, but they never catch in the sense, today you find a lady extremely sweet and nice, go to her house, she gives you food. Next day she looks at you like a digress. That's not possible in India. There's consistency in their life. Now today supposing we have Dr. Burley career singing, tomorrow you won't find him shouting at you. No, that's not. Or today you find somebody very honest. In the West it's very common, I've seen, very, very common. You trust somebody who's honest man, make him a, say, an accountant. Next time you find he has decamped with money. If somebody is honest in India, then he is honest all his life. If he's honorable, he's honorable all his life. Then he doesn't change like this. What is the reason? There is no depth. So when you get realization, you just don't touch your depth to live superficially. So now we have to forget from where we have come. We have to know where we have reached. We have become the Spirit now. Forget your past, forget the style you have led, forget everything, humble down. Humbling down is the important, humble down in your hearts. If you have to grow, you have to go deep. Only through humility, through the weight, through the weight of humility you only go deep down. Not condemning yourself, not saying that you are wrong, your forefathers were wrong, nothing, just humble down and grow inward. Must know our weaknesses. This is the biggest problem in the West. We never want to see our own weaknesses. And the other weakness is in the West is, it's, now it's very complicated society. Like supposing I want to say that, see, your son is like this. Then they don't mind taking the blame of the sons, this behavior upon themselves. So it may be I have done it, so that it never reaches the sun. But if I say you have done something, they'll say, no, perhaps maybe my mother, because she treated me psychologically, something happened into me, so it has happened. Because I was born in a family which was very strict, I had a broken home. That's why it has happened. Nothing of the kind. You are a spirit. All these explanations are against you. You are going against yourself. You are cheating yourself. Because I come from such and such place, it has happened, is wrong. I'll give you an example of Yogi Mahajan, whom you know very well. You know, when he came, actually, when Indians come here, they also develop sometimes this ego part. He came to France for My puja. And to so many people, Yogi is like a sort of a guru. He has a beard and he has mustache like that. And sometimes he has a big ego trip, but more than him, his disciples have greater ego trips. And those people who work with him also get into such big ego trips that we are having horrible time. I sent one of them to Australia. He had to take up a job. So he would not take up any job. People said, what is it? I was chief executive of Mahajan's export company. What was he exporting? Those clay packs to America. He was the chief executive of that. And now he can't take up any other job but a chief executive. Now nobody is exporting clay packs from Australia. So he is without a job. So he is without a job. I told him, you better dig some. And we'll export it. First do the digging. Then we'll export it to America. So all this kind of a nonsense comes. Indians, though I mean, I must say, S.E.P. is occupying such a big position. I mean, if you see him where he is about, whatever it is, but he is much more humble than many of the surgeons, I can tell you. Though sometimes he also goes off because you see in this country you pump up the ego so much that maybe, sometimes. But he sees it now. Now he sees it and he was telling Me his best way to get out of it is to see it. He sees it. And every time he does something, he always asks for forgiveness, always. He asks for forgiveness from anyone. But he told Me this country is such that where you get blown up. People will pamper you so much because you have a position. Yes, sir, sir, sir, sir, sir, sir. But even those who are garbage cleaners have the same ego. Even worse than S.E.P. is much worse. So what is the reason? Why this bumptiousness? Why this wrong ideas about yourself? It is because we are not one with reality and we have no joy. We cannot grow artificially. So if you can somehow or other see that horrible thing called ego and watch it nicely, first thing that should happen. I would say an example of that. If you don't mind, I'll say more or less. He has a tremendous ego. Ego raised to power, hundred, hundred and eighty. Very first came to me. But I knew one thing about this man that he loves truth. This is the point, is. There where I found his depth, he loves truth. There where I have to hit him. As see now today, what a product! What have you achieved in Sahaja Yoga? I mean he met Me only four years back, can you believe it? The first time when he came, he was roaring like a lion. I mean, everything was there. Everything fizzled out gradually. He was so angry with Me, shouting at the top of his voice, being all sorts of nonsensical things. Can you believe Warren was shouting at Me? Can you believe? But I could see that in him that he loved truth. I go up to a point, if I don't see you coming out of that ego, you will have to get out of Sahaja Yoga. All that you have enjoyed in Sahaja Yoga, you'll have to give up. I tell you that today. You better learn this lesson. When you come to India, you improve, no doubt. Then we'll be having ashrams there, where you can come and stay and see for yourself, develop your depth. But we cannot have burdensome people who pull down other Sahaja Yogis, Sahaja Yoginis, try to bring problem for collectivity. We cannot afford it. We cannot afford it. Like a boat, we have to cross over. All of us are in the boat and some are jonas. They should be thrown out. Should we make the boat sink for them? So no liabilities will be accepted in Sahaja Yoga, I promise you today. Since I've come here, I've been sick. Humble done. Humble done. In humility, in righteousness, you will find your own glory, the light of humility. Not in eerie yoga. In ego you are blind. You can't see anything. Only in humility, in that silence of humility, you'll find your own glory, your own dignity. Everything you'll find in humility. But not by condemning yourself. But in humility. That's the time really you help yourself and love yourself when you are humble. So it is said, humble down in your heart. It's said that I've got the picture of my mother in my heart. I have to just bend my head and I see it there. Just to bend my head and I see my mother's picture there. What? But keep it up. The thing is you cannot keep this tempo of humility. You have to keep it up. I come here, all right, everything is fine, good. Again I come back, I must be prepared to suffer for two, three days again. Then you are all right. But this is only working through Me, through My efforts. What about you, yourself working it out? I tell you, you don't have to exert at all to be humble. But there's one way you can do it. Always tell yourself. So for example now we have Michael here and say, he is saying from America. He said, you Mr. American, will you behave yourself? Address yourself. You Michael American, will you behave yourself and come down to reality now? Do you know you are the spirit? Address yourself like that. Address yourself like that. Stand before the mirror. Separate yourself. Say that is your ego and you are the spirit. Now you talk to your ego. You don't exist. Do you know what you are? You are nothing. If there is light in front of me, if there is light in front of me, there will be no reflection also. You are like My shadow. You are a myth. Because I am standing before a mirror, you exist otherwise you don't exist anywhere. And I can create infinite number like you. How? Put another mirror behind. And there will be infinite images, these artificial ones I can create in one second. But you can't create Me. You cannot influence Me. You cannot bring Me down. I am the spirit. You cannot be the spirit. Has to be taken up. Otherwise I tell you, some of you may start looking like Aurangzeb or Genghis Khan or Hitler or something like that. You see all these, suddenly I find something among Sahaja Yogis, some Hitler standing with a mustache and a hair like that, the nose like that. Suddenly I find someone like that. It's quite possible. I mean, what I have seen of Sahaja Yoga at the West, I am surprised, you see. You leave somebody as a little sparrow and when you come back you find a hawk. Is that the same person? Yes, now she's become a hawk, only possible in the West, I can tell you. If you tell somebody in India, they will not believe. Like Mr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, only possible in the West. When I read this story I said, how can it be possible? Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, I said, how can it be possible? But I've seen it. It happens here. When they are good, they are very, very good. And when they are bad, they are horrid. But that's only in the West. You don't find this in India, why? The reason is we are deep into ourselves, very deep. All right, you have not missed anything now because you got your realization as they have got it, you got the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga as they have got it. But test it upon yourself and humble down yourself, go down into yourself, facing yourself, just telling yourself, no, I have to be deeper and deeper, I'm not going to listen to anything. Ego and all that nonsense, I'm not going to listen, I'm going to go deeper and deeper. And move into yourself, embed yourself into reality, piercing through all these ego and nonsensical ideas that come from it. Then only you can correct it, otherwise you can. The best way in meditation I've seen to improve your ego is to meditate on My feet. My feet have that magic. Have you got photographs of My feet? I don't find anything here. You have, just bring one, just bring one. All right, watch them. All right. So very small. Not this one, not this one. Not this kind, another one, it's straight. Ah, see? I'm going to take a picture. My brain is flowing. You are going to go there? Yes. Ah, that's it. You are reflecting too much, though, the light. Can we take out this? Yes, please. Yes, please. Get lots of these, all kinds they have. Lighter? Yes, please. Now the second group can come in. Are you all right now? Better? Still there? Beat yourself with shoes, I tell you. Beat yourself with shoes. That's the best way. Go and beat yourself with shoes. All of you. Now those, come and just. Very simple feet. Get some puja ones also. So I haven't got. Yes. Okay. Okay. No need to rub My feet, you can just wash them. Can you feel the vibrations? Going? Now let's have the second group coming down. Please move out as you be. Please move. Have you got kumkum here? Bring it. Those who have not rubbed My feet can rub with the kumkum. It will be good idea. Those who have not rubbed My feet so far should wait and others can meditate a little bit on the feet. Those who have not been able to come forward. Come this side. Come here. Ah. Can you feel the vibrations now, the cool breeze? Put it in a katori or something. Put it in a... Like so. Hmm. Now. All right? Good? They said how are you? Better? Good. Now those who want to come further, come now. Now some others to come further. Now some others to come further. Now some others to come further. Now just watch. All right? Are you better now? All right. Shri Mataji. Put up. Put up with the water. No, just try. Just try. Ah. Did you use the eyes? It helped you? It's right sided problem. Stomach, how you did it? On the liver? That also helped, at least. Now your breathing is all right. Virginia, you sit here. Don't close your eyes. All right. All right. All right, improving? Face is improving, yes. Hmm. Fabulous. Feet, feet. Continuously. You are not thinking about them. You just have to see it. Ah. Ah. Hmm. Now another group. All of you have been all right? All of you all right? Now. Those who have not rubbed My feet before, come forward. Raise the Kundu. You have not had done My pujas. Come here. Come forward. Never get the Kundu. All right. Come along. Take this and rub it on My foot. Come along. Whole thing. Hold it. Now. Their hands are cooler than My feet today. That's the best part. You see? Now, you see. Now, left hand. Left hand. Now, right hand. Now, the other hand. Now, the other hand. This is Rosalina. This is Rosalina. Ah, I could make out. And you are the uncle. And the ex-partum. I mean, you are a little girl.

You can now make this earth, puthalo means you can rise it to the skies. That's what it says. It was written when he was sixteen years of age. He is very innocent and very sweet you know.

Oh, by this meeting, because of this meeting, Surdas had become, he had become very anxious about this meeting. And Kabira got lost in this meeting. Surdas had become anxious and Kabira lost because Surdas didn't have Realisation. So he's saying Kabira got completely Kabira got completely coloured because he was a weaver and he used to colour, you see, clothes. So always it is connected with him. So he says that he got completely coloured into this. Rajasook, hai? Shoor ke saare, ek hai? Raj, Rajsook, shoor ke saare. Jeevani hai? Jeevani Jeevani hai. Neera got mad, leaving all her pleasures of royal life, you see. Sahaja main nahi hai. But our Mother Nirmala has given us, hira means the diamond, has in this meeting she has given us the diamond. Mahavira and Buddha, both of them have sung the song of a formless God. But here the saints from the East and the West have met as if they are very old friends. This is how the Milan Bala Sundar Shabder, there is an English one and this Milan. They embraced and love, met. Milan is, see the Milan means when you meet, you see.

So I feel very proud of myself and the life has become a blessing. Very good song it is, isn't it, describing the feelings of the Sahaja Yogis, you see, what has happened. Very nice. This song I like. Very nice. Our concert. Kishna likha hai? Mitla matla batao to sab kachala gaya hana, ve hai bina thi suni hai, ekati nahin hana. Veena vate, expert. Ova laga hai na kabir hai. That Kabir one you taught in Italy, Sathya leh. Saiya nahin ekga se. What do you do? Sathya leh bina thi suni hai? Bina thi suni hai gaya. Shambhagam. Achha? Bajao? Veena, you play? You play also na? This song, let me, let me. Come along, come along. What? But, kabhiye lo. You went down. Where were you? Five pound. Down? How was that? Mad people. Shri Mataji, the children go play in the mud and then you have to go to the other side. Shri Mataji, the children go play in the mud and then you have to clean them. The children go and play in the mud and then you have to clean them. Downtown is the... Downtown. I heard this downtown word. It's not money, not used in English language, but is American, I think. So, one lady had told Me to call her sister or some son or something. She was sick lady. So I telephoned her. It was a trunk call. So she said, moondaa downtown gaya hai. Moondaa he said to the boy. She said, moondaa downtown gaya hai. Downtown kya hai gaya hai? Aji downtown gaya hai gaya hai. I didn't know what to say to her. I said, but downtown kaat aji downtown. She thought I'm some ignorant woman, doesn't know what to say. I mean, she was a sick lady, but she also used the same word, downtown. I said, no, there's no word. Moondaa downtown gaya hai. Mariya center city bolte hai. Mariya center city bolte hai. That's still sensible. No, but Hindi mein kya hai. Hindi mein kya hai. Mein kya downtown bolte hai. Share toh sare yo gaya hai. Share toh kun nawa hai. Downtown kya hai. Gujibhi hai. Center. Center city. Kaapne saab mein amlogar koi, usi shair mein gaya ho. Toh dhi kang hai downtown gaya hai. Kang hai bhar gaya hai. Barbar pocho downtown kaun sa town hai bhai. I didn't understand this word, downtown. So I said, which town is this downtown? Where has he gone? Because this lady had sent some word for it. So I said, now how to contact? She's gone downtown. And there is nothing written down in the map downtown. I was really a villager. Suburbs wale hai. They live in the burbs. American English is different from what we are learning. They'll fix you. I'll fix your breakfast. Everything is fixed like a screw. Then they said, all right, all fixed. I said, what do you mean? What do you mean by all fixed? I mean, have you given the keys? Then say that have you given the keys, all fixed. All right. So then we went to the, we were going to the airport. There were agents of seepur. So he says, he asked his wife, this is the road. We have to hit this boulevard. I thought, whom are they going to hit? So she said, yes, you hit. Such a fright, I said, are they going to hit both of them? I was sitting behind, they were in front. Then said, now it's fixed. All the time they are fixing me. So I said, now why are you fixing me all the time? Are you going to set me to the moon or what? It's interesting language to begin with, you know. And the way they use it. There you are. There you are. There you are. There you are. There you are. Wherever you reach, wherever you reach there, here we are. Kaitri bola chakshat. Now you are all set. All you set? All set. All fixed, I mean like a jelly, she has to be fixed. Ochs so bhe boh, good morning nahi karega, how are you doing? How are you doing? Achcha? Why is the napki hotel room and how are you doing this morning? How are you doing, what? What do you want me to do? Okay, what is non-America? We were walking on the, we were walking towards the airport, you see. One fellow was coming with the trolley. He said, hey, hey, how are you? So he used this one. This is our Chicago airport. Our Chicago. Are you going? Paichan ho na ho. It's okay, is this Chicago? Abhut toh kabra jaya hai. You see any man saying that to any lady, she'll get a shock in India. Hey, karo bohot hai na, is this Chicago airport? You got it. You got it. Ya bale hai. You got it. Chicago makya hai. You got it. Abkhush kai jay se, is this the, you know, so and so street? You got it. Jai se darwada kun nata, I'll get it. Yeah, I'll get it. Bala purvi samdhaisasne, what sort of English language? Maya hai. Then they have the word around, you know, for root. Haan, oto phet. Oto bohot jaya hai. Ushka toh kushne, parkushabdha haa bhi jata hai. See, that's it. But it's good for them. But I think little laziness about pronunciation. Rather lousy. Pronunciation wise, it's very difficult to understand. Like our Pradhan Sahape, old Appalai Pradhan Sahape, he came here. And we had some people who came down. So he said, what do you say to primordial Mother? She said, we say Bhagavati. What? Right? They couldn't say Bhagavati. So he pulled his ears. He said, Mother, please excuse me. Bhagavati. I said, ten days I was ahead of you and I learnt it, how to speak. Just put your thing this side or this side. But you see, for a person like Me, I am hopelessly bad. If anything is mispronounced, I cannot understand. I mean, that's sort of an innate in Me. Everybody laughs at Me in My family. Everyone makes fun of Me for time. And then coming to America, when you really go crazy, I can't understand. For about, at least for two days, I just watched their movements and then I understand what they are saying. But with Sahaja Yogis, it's all right. Sahaja Yogis are straightforward. They speak. I don't know how you become so straightforward. About it. You don't talk like that at all. Especially when you are in the middle of the night. It's very straightforward. Even in India, the Indian Sahaja Yogis have remarked that Americans have changed completely. I said, what do you mean? Said, they don't say, ah, ah. It's very remarkable. This is the biggest change, I think. That I think they cannot speak normally. So they have to use this. But with you people you have become so transformed. It's just like anybody can understand. I have been here for 28 years. Let us see. I have been here for 28 years. Let us see. I have been here for 28 years. Let us see. I have been here for 28 years. Let us see. I have been here for 28 years. Let us see. I have been here for 28 years. Let us see. I have been here for 28 years. Let us see. I think you know the meaning of this. Or not. This was actually composed by one girl, but she was not. She was a very good girl. She was a very good girl. She was a very good girl. She was a very good girl. She was a very good girl. This was actually composed by one girl, but then I changed the whole thing. It's little different. But do you know the meaning or not? There is a translation. It's written down. It's there. Meaning is there. Very good meaning. You read the meaning part. Shama from Shri Shri Shama. Shama Gupta? Anurita Sahaja Yoga Shama. Shri Mooj banana Gaana. He's made that song. Shri Anurita Sahaja Yoga Shama. He's made that song. Shama. One song he's made himself. No, no. Maharashtrian Rasha Apshadar. Hindi song, yes. I remember him from 22. Very nice. Satya Janamaju. Satya Janamaju punne kiye se. That is he made. You see, he studied Hindi and he's made the song. It's very surprising. Tuned it. He's a very nice boy. His two brothers were wasted. I don't know what happened to them. Stupid as they are. Very stupid. Sorry for them. I'll take your office. All right. So, Ooh-gah, coffee Ooh-gah, Gaana, Waana. Thank you Shri Mataji. In spite of all the travelling. So what songs are you singing tomorrow? For these Jews and the Iranians? Jogwa, Jogwa. Iran, Iran. Iranian, then... Qawwali. Most of them are coming to American program because of the place. It's near the... living near the... Santamani. Santamani. Qawwali. This place... This place where is the program for India is close to for India. The Iranians are not living in that area. So there's more... First day they won't come. All of them, they told Me they come to Santamani to America. All right. Now what about the first day is who are coming? Jews. They are coming to the second day. They are coming to the second day. So they are coming to the second day. All right. Now what about the first day is who are coming? Jews. Indians. Indians. So first day is Jews. First day is Jews. That's Udaya. Udaya konai? Udaya. India. India. India. India. And Parvayat. So India and Israel are together. Also we had lots of Jews, very good Jews. Lots of Jews. Lots of Jews, lots of men are there. So good Jews and Jews together. Good Jews and Jews. All are Jews. They all have come from Iran but... All of them. Jews are all of them and they have got all this fabric of clothing here in Los Angeles. This day, every day I was going to this fabric to see these people, to invite them for the program. They are all Jews. They are building 20 stories. They are all Jews, all Americans. And all the shops are Iranian in downtown. For Jews. In downtown. Now we went downtown. Not there. Not there. I am happy they are willing to come and they want to know about it. See, at least they should get out of these nonsensical ideas that they have. Nobody wants to understand the point. See, it's very difficult. I don't know why to the Islamic mind to get out of it. It's very difficult. Like this Rouhani gentleman. I mean he has respect for Me, he thinks no end of Me, everything is there. But still in the same... Yes. He doesn't get out. Majeed is frustrated with him. He says, you... I say, Majeed, what are you doing? Mother, you say, she can't get out of it. In his presence. So it is true. I mean it's some sort of a mental obsession. But I thought at least the intellectuals will be all right. There's one Bani Sadr, who I went to see. He is just the same. He said whatever you may say, Islam is the best religion. I see it, but what it has done just is yours. You are not equipped for Islam. I told him everything. He couldn't get realization also. And just killing each other, that's what they are doing now. Iraq, Iran. Very stupid. I think they will be the last to come to Sahaja Yoga. I feel that. But if you can handle Iran, then we'll be all right. Yes, Shri Mataji, if you come here, I'm ready to go. Yeah. Because they are real fundamentalists now. Surprisingly, being Shias, they are the worst fundamentalists. And actually the story is like this. I'm not saying that. And actually the story is like this. I must tell you because my father had told me that Koran was not written down. Mohammed Sahib did not know how to read and write. So he told his friends. They also said they remembered by heart. I can't believe it. My lecture, can you remember by heart? Even one. You can't. So they said they remembered by heart. All right. Then there was one fellow called Muddeya. He is the one who is the culprit. Just like we have Paul, he was there. So what, except for Abu Bakr, who became the second Khalifa. Of course that was not the idea of Mohammed Sahib. He wanted Ali to be. But he became. He died. And after that came another two Khalifas. I think so. And also Ali. So this Muddeya killed Ali, his two children. And later on he killed also these two Khalifas. And one of the Khalifas liver was eaten by his mother. And then he became in charge. And he edited the Quran. He wrote the Quran. So such a funny man who has killed three Khalifas and their sons. How can he be called as something great? Whole basis is wrong. And he wrote Quran. Now these people the way they are following it like blind. What are they following is Quran which is edited by this Muddeya. How can it be anywhere near truth? But there are lots of truths in it no doubt. It's not that it's absolutely. But so many things I think he has put it. One is against the women. Then he has put Sharia. It's his dream. Mohammed Sahib would not have done it. Like this Paul. Paul has put his own things. Can't understand. And this Sharia is really given to Jews by Moses. If you read the Old Testament in the third one called as what you call that is Jeremiah. This Sharia was given by Moses to Jews who were in a decadent condition. So Jews didn't accept. After some time they just gave it up. The Muslims now have been bestowed with this kind of a thing. And for any small thing you do your hands must be cut, your head must be cut. No value for human life. It was meant for people who were extremely decadent at that time. But those times are over now. In modern times even they cut the throat, they cut the hands, they bury the women also half way. Recently this lady who has said that revised the Koran. The three. She had a place in the middle of the city she had a place I mean she is a writer all right but she saw these things happening in Bangladesh. The women were buried half way and they were beaten up, those three women like that and then they committed suicide. So the husbands used to beat them, torture them so they fell in for some another man. That's all. Sometimes it is just also a kind of a doubt but still they do this to women. Can you imagine? This was meant for Jews and Jews didn't bother. Such a mess of a thing it is, all these. Even Christian religion has the same mess but there is one thing which is common. Like I met a Muslim from Bosnia and I asked him what is the matter with you. You are believing in formless God, why are you fighting for the land? He said that's not the point. It's written in our Koran that if you fight in the name of God and if you are buried then your body will come out and you will get your resurrection. Can you believe that? After five hundred years what body is going to come out? You see most unreasonable, most illogical thing to say but it is for the Jews, it's for Christians and for Muslims they all believe. That's why they bury. Now from where this stupidity has come there? But that way I must say Indian philosophy is correct because what they have said it in this Bhrugu Sangita that the souls which are seeking the truth will be born at this time. They will be born as householders not as sannyasis or anything. Those who are searching in the mountains and in the valleys they will be born and they will be householders and they will get their realization. Is much more sensible? This I can't understand the dead bodies coming out of the graves and they have occupied so much of land with all these things. In the city of Paris in the center you find such a big everywhere but in Italy they build even houses, you see, where the boots are living. One grave will build a household. They make small small houses, you see. Yes. Actually coming to Kabela also there is one. Like that. You can't avoid it. All boots' bodies must be coming out now. To get their resurrection. Nobody lives there. It's just built for the grave. One grave. Several. The whole family. Friends everywhere. And they are so hypocritical. Everybody is so hypocritical. Vettica now, Vettica is such a hypocritical institution. There is one film you must see. Godfather number three. The Vettica bestowed a big award on the head of the Mafia. Supposed to be in charge of religion, you know. It's all money oriented. And for forty years they ruled Italy. Now the Vettica is in trouble. Mr. Pope is in trouble. He has HIV virus in him. And they say with blood transfusion he got it. I mean who will give him blood like that? It's terrible. No truth about them. No truth. Horribly immoral people calling themselves. Thank God, you see, at least in India religion is not so organized. If you organize the religion then there is hierarchy, priest, tumka, tumka. But there is Vedas Indians running after this Murari Bapu. Yeah, I mean, Ramana is a very loud person. Ramana is a very loud person. Is it a very loud person? Yes, it is. He organizes the marriage between Rama and Sita. And you have to pay for the true show of Sita. So all these stupid Gujaratis and Marwadi ladies, they take out their diamond bangles and gold bangles and give him for the marriage. They were married long time back. They had children. Now why are you marrying them again? I am a Tarava Dutrasah. May mukha saktir padam. For nine days they had this program. Every day starting eleven to three o'clock. And everybody was there in London. In London? He doesn't know music, he doesn't know anything, I don't know. If you want to be stupid, what can you do? Sahaja Yoga is not meant for stupid people. But he died now. Now this is another one. He is a disciple. He came bearded. In Dusthana Sahib, what is the name of the man who came? Stupid Indians, I tell you. It's a Jewish airline, Shri Mataji, who brought him over for the US tour. Jewish company, a tower air. The airline that brought him over. He brought him over for the US tour. Jewish company, a tower air. The airline that brought him. They ripped out all the seats in the plane and they made a Takat for him on which to sit and give Pravachan on the flight to come here via Amsterdam all the way. It's really strange. Because they all do US tours in this season. False gurus. Money making season. Open season. It's not a good idea. But Indians are not allowed to do that? No, they are not allowed to do that. Is that right? They are allowed to do that. No, but that's okay. I'll tell you later. Like the story we have. Panchatantra was written long term. It was a story that the father told the son, wherever many people go you should go behind. So he came out of his house and he saw many people going. So he also followed. And they ended up into the Smashan. There was a body they were taking to be burned. And this fellow followed. So use your discretion. Use your wisdom is the point. But this is how they are. You think by doing all this nonsense they will achieve their resurrection. This lady, this Sabarwal from this TV Asia, she asked Me, Mother, that in such a big hall there were five thousand people and the Indians were not even one or two percent. What's the matter? She asked Me. She asked Me. And I said, I didn't want to say they were stupid, but I said that, you see, they go on with whatever they have been doing so far. They don't want to give up. And South is even worse. South is so much horrible that that shows how stupid people are. If a woman wants something she will cut her hair, completely shave it and she gives it to the temple and they send it to America for weeks. And this lady goes on rolling round the temple and somebody is throwing water on her. Horrible! I saw it Myself. I said, what's this going on? So she wants a son so she is doing this. So the hair are... That's a common thing. Very common. That's it. Guru pati. It's a money making with them. Money making propositions. Real hairs are being made. No artificial hairs. I mean, but brainless. You are not brainless. You are brainless. You are brainless. You are brainless. You are brainless. You are brainless. You are brainless. You cannot say any community has sense. Nobody. It's boring if you say they are another one. That fat fellow that Aga Khan was very fat. First at the age of 25 was weighed on silver. Then at 50 on gold and 75 were lived, you know, with diamonds. Can you imagine? And paga sarkilagalatye chakka. Anik, that's your friend Shubhayika. He owns that hotel Danyali in Venice. French wives. His son has bought lot of land in Sardinia. Kahe bhi chavno. It's come and you've washed. Acres after acres. Half of a Sardinia he has bought it. Adhaje che kasino karna raha hai. Anything they do is all right. Stupid things. Ata bhaguk kithi lok expose zaleh. Zaleh tabaru. What we need is to expose these people because if they die without exposure still apla chaleh thare rama haare krishna. No slice. Kithi lok, how many have been lost like this? How many? Rashaan pada lata na hai. They have run away from Russia now. Thank God. All false people have run away. They said we'll just have this Orthodox Church and now the Orthodox Church accepts. Surprisingly Orthodox Church, you know. One branch, not the other one. The black order does not but the white order. At least it's very big achievement, I think. He was there asking when the scientists were surprised. They gave me an award which is given only so far to ten people. This award of the honorary academician. Say and to Me they gave. Tenth one is Me. So even Einstein has got anyway. So I was quite shy. I said what are you doing? You are giving Me something equal to Einstein? He said what? What has Einstein done? You just work on matter, you work on human beings. So mir koos ki akh kalini hai, I don't feel, you know, anyway something is wrong with Me. I mean even when you say Mataji ki jaya, I also think I should say Mataji ki jaya. Mataji is somebody else, not Me. You said it on that interview also. Sabarwal le poocha hai, the interview mein you said it on the TV ashiya ke interview mein. She said don't you feel anything when people sing your praise. So you said you also join them and sing with them inside. Really I think. I don't know what is this supposed to be. This ego business. You see if you are something, what is there to be egoistical about it? You are that, isn't it? You are that, so what? If you are Adi Shakti, so what is there to feel egoistical about it? You are. What is so great? Now I have not achieved anything. I have not achieved any higher state or anything. So why should there be anything like that? I don't know. So why should there be anything like that? Jadaan, jadaan, chandeshat, jadaa saan mai manto. Statement of facts. Oh artha? Shaksha tas le aar. Aata, aapad ka shala post kar aicha. Aani thai se ego kuttna jarto thetsma la samjat nahi. Log ma nahi tumala ego nahi hai mata jaya bhakti. Muntra kuttu kas la. Ya hai the hai? But I don't think it's great to be Adi Shakti ke apahete. Aata kuni aslata rasli. If somebody is Adi Shakti, somebody is Adi Shakti. What? You don't feel proud that you are human beings, do you? Same thing. It's the same. It's the same. You see, if you see, it's the same. Somebody is this, somebody is that, somebody is that. But at least you people have achieved something. You have transformed yourself, changed your life. But what have I achieved to be proud of? I have achieved nothing. Whatever I was, I have been, I will be, whatever I achieved, nothing. So what is there to be proud of? I can't understand still. Beyond Me, I just don't understand that. Some things I am missing, I think, in My head. My husband always tells Me that. You see, you never know what you are. I said, I know what I am. So but you never assert. He said, that's why because I know what I am, how can I assert? It's a common thing. Will you assert yourself because you are human beings? Nobody will. I have not yet heard anybody, I am a human being, yes. Take it as a matter of fact. Take it for granted. See, it's nothing that one has to work out ego or something. It's just there. You are just like that. You are like that. It's nothing to be suggested or told or meditated. It's just there. And to be it's very Sahaja, you know. To be just like this. But if somebody tells down, you put up some airs. I don't know how to do the drama. It comes from the way it is described today, actually, when I read it, that it is Nishprava. Nish, Nirmala, from there. It's not there. Nirankara, it's not there. Nirmala is not there. But I would not say that because you do not have these things, so something low about them because you are human beings, you are not Adi Shakti, so it's all right. I mean, it's a, now you don't feel proud that you are not a dog, do you feel? I mean, take away. Way to explain it. I mean, I don't say that you are dog, but what I am trying to say that you don't feel higher than a dog or something. It's a dog. He's a dog. I am a human being finished. In the same way I am Adi Shakti. Nothing great, I tell you. It's a, I am rather sometimes surprised when people try to honor me. Now this Governor is going to see me, Me Adi Mele Adi. Feel very shy. Feel very shy about all these things. The Kaibola has attention, Shri Kaman has. I think it is for this life is very important. I think that we should not assert at all. All other incarnations asserted. They thought to fight these nonsensical people you have to assert. But I think for Kundalini rising there's no need to assert and if it rises, problem is solved. Then there is no problem. Till it has not risen, there's a problem, a gap. Once it has risen, there's no gap between human beings and divinity. This is the only thing which I think I know how to do it. But if you ask Me to open a plastic bag, I cannot. I'm sorry. Just can't do it. I ask Beedot to do that job for me. It's all search. It's not complicated. To be Divine is the most search thing. Because you are doing nothing, sitting down here everything is worked out so it's very nice to be searched. Nothing you do. I tell you those who say I have to do this, I have to do that, they are in trouble. But those who will say, no, no, I'm not doing anything, I'm just sitting down. It will work out there. Just now She was telling Me, Reena, that She wanted to come with us, with Me to America. And suddenly She got money from somewhere. It just works out. Only you should desire. I told you about these miracles. One is, he can tell you, Nargilkar. Nargilkar from Delhi. You see, his son, I had told him that he should do his B.Com. And he had a motorbike, that's what he tells Me. He was going on the motorbike, met with an accident. He doesn't remember. He doesn't remember. Maybe some truck must have hit him or whatever. But a very bad accident. And then he came home walking and he doesn't know how he came home. And they saw his brain was intact, everything perfect except little bit of scratches. But the best is one lady, one girl, you know, she had some frustration in her love affair, whatever it is. So she wanted to kill herself and her father had a revolver because he was in the custom. So she put the bullet through here which came out from this side and she started bleeding. So they took her to the hospital. And it was amazing that they said it has not hurt the lungs at all. It has gone round. I mean it was just having a nice walk, I think. It didn't hurt anything and it came out with a little blood and she got out of the hospital after three days. This is really we cannot explain, no? Another is girl, this is Sushmita, saying, she is a Sahaja Yogini and her father is Sahaja Yogini. They came to see Me in Delhi. And she said, mother, you know, they want me to go for a beauty contest. What do you think? I said, go, why not? So she said, just now it is in India. I don't want to wear funny dresses. I said, you wear swimming dress also, isn't it? Yes, I do. You wear swimming dress if they ask. She went there. No, so I said that she said, just now I have to just do this India, Miss India. I said, you will be Miss Universe. And she is, she has become very surprised. She is not such a good looking woman or anything, but her poise and the way she answered like a Sahaja Yogini, you know, they were surprised and they, she really had, she would see her expression when they told her that. I said, so many miracles. Ata warned us, one was so sick, I gave him bandhan in New York and he felt better there. How efficient is this? He was like that. So this is it. We have to be Sahaj. Go on. In 1983 America too, you finished your lecture in a parking lot, one boy said, I can't hear. And then you just put your finger and then you whisper in that ear and he said, I can hear. Ata Manoj's daughter was very sick and she was feeling horrible. So they warned her. He just brought her there. I just said a mantra in his ears about Vitthala and everything disappeared. Five minutes. Because this is the truth, you see. She was very unhappy, very much in trouble and all that. Five minutes. I just said it in her ear. She became such a change in her mind. They all said she went in and came out with another face. So we are now in the Kingdom of Heaven. Kingdom of God. So why should we not be Sahaj? I'll tell you about him, Samir is another interesting kid. Samir had broken his leg and it was in plastic. He heard that I have come to Delhi. So he came out with another face. He heard that I have come to Delhi. So he told the doctor, please open my leg. So the doctor said, I can't. He said, you better open. Then he got it, Samir had opened. He came limping there. When he went away, he was just running. He was all righting. He went and told the doctor, see now what has happened to me. It's very simple. And there's Sahaj Raylai. If you are Sahaj, everything works out. In Sahaj. All right? It's very nice photograph. Ali bag. Ali ball. Ali bag bullahein. Ali bag bullahein. Ali bag. Bag? Bag. Per ek kar ke pujya aun Ali in the bag. Par aapne aake hai, I am Hanato Setha Sahib. In our languages there's nothing like aa. He is regarded as ridiculing somebody or something but they have not heard any aa in any Sanskrit, Hindi, Marathi. They don't have aa part. Aa or aa. But no aa. In English language only. But when we write it down, we put a thing like this on aa, means aa. Like advocate we have to write, then we put it. Advocate. But when we have to write a foreign language in our language, in our script, then we use aa. But there is nothing like aa at all in Sanskrit, Hindi or Marathi. In America mein aa sound hai nahi ho bhat ko bath bullahing hai, or path ko path. Bath. Bhat ko bath bullahing hai? Bath ko. Bath mein bullahing hai. Oh path rastaw deh na, usko me path. Path. Bath is a word coming from Sanskrit, path. Sanskrit word is path. Absolute path, pure, is path. Coming from there is path. So you should say path. Rippa riyas mukha. Rippa riyas mukha. I don't think it was so. It started about I think 25 years back or so, because if you see the old films, they speak the same language as we do. Anyone else? There are so many, like Magnificent Obsession, have you seen that one? No? Bette Davis. You see very beautiful. You haven't seen her films? For a little bit. You haven't seen Bette Davis' films? Some, a few. Anita Garbos? Very few. You get all these old films, the language is so straightforward, acting so good, you'll be amazed. But you are surprised? You saw this War and Peace? War and Peace, you must have seen. Some of it. Not the whole film. Not the whole. That's a little boring, but... But some of them are beautiful, you see. This has a story, it has acting, diction so clear cut. Nowadays for American film you have to get some American to tell you what they are talking about. Translation? Yes, you have seen Gaslight? I have seen Gaslight. All right. Once you feel the gaslight. You have seen Gaslight? I'll give you, can give you a list of those. When we were in college, we used to see those. In college. But there has been since then some, I think 25, 30 years, since then the films have gone down completely. I mean you have really missed real good films and not violence, nothing of the kind, but story and events, you see, how the events develop so artistically done. I don't know where all has disappeared like that. You have some good films now, but not of that kind, that level. I've touched on television, they say that... What's that? Nowadays the movies they show on television, they don't want you to imagine anything, they show everything. They don't want? Nothing left to your imagination. Nothing is left to the imagination. Everything is show. That's first. Application of brain is not necessary. Not necessary. You can have this computer. Or you can have this kambaku. Calculators. Two plus two. Two plus two. The brain, what will happen to this brain? Mechanism... So that is what it is. Thank you. I'll tell you something. I've seen something good, dream or something. Let Me God bless you. Very interesting. There is a shop in the middle. Oh, there. There is a shop. There is a shop. Please tell me. Christ, Christ, Christ. Christ. There is no inside this little thing. God Goodbye. Looks like you absorption. it um Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. How are you? I'm fine. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. How are you? Fine. I'm fine. Fine. Hi. Hello. Hello. How are you? I'm fine. Hi. Thank you. I agree. You're a working girl. That's great though. I mean, yeah. Yeah, right. I'm just trying to stop it. It stopped it though. I guess it just turned out alright. It's okay to just leave it on. Having forbid you should erase it. No. He showed me how to pause it. Oh, I see.

On the contrary, we are not contented. We are in turmoil all the time. For a little while we feel happy, then we feel unhappy, then depressed. Every one within themselves had this innate beautiful faith about the Divine when they were born. The Divinity is there all the time intact within you. Whatever wrong you might have done, whatever mistakes you might have committed, the Divinity is still there. It has to manifest. And you all have this power within you which we call as Kundalini, which connects you to this all-pervading Divine power. As this instrument has to be connected to the mains, then it has some meaning. You are also to be connected to this all-pervading power. So the truth is that you are not this body, this mind, this ego, these conditionings, but above all you are the pure Spirit. The another truth is that there is an all-pervading power of Divine love. This Divine power works out beautiful things which we call as living work. You see these beautiful flowers and I was told that this place is called as a rosary gardens. We take it for granted. It's a miracle but we take it for granted. Look at our eyes, beautiful camera, look at our brain, tremendous computer, but we take everything for granted. Who has made it? So this faith that was within us has been challenged in modern times very much more. They are not Spirit oriented. And they all believe that they are the best and they have formed formidable, absolutely horrifying fundamentalism. But none of them are really helping us to ascend. The seeker of truth with his faith gets disappointed and disalarmed. Then there is science which has just solved problems of a very mundane nature. It is not conclusive and it doesn't deal with the totality. We have a doctor for one eye and another doctor for another eye. Thus we feel that science is the solution that will take us to reality is not the truth. In the modern times so much of mechanization has taken place that people have become extremely speedy and now they complain of the stress developing on them. But if you go on all the time thinking about the future all the time then naturally future as it does not exist will have a problem. So the third thing which is very also common in the West specially are the entrepreneurs. They are the people who start creating new and newer things. New and newer dresses, fashions and people do not even think for themselves. The other day I told them that the entrepreneurs have taken out an idea of holiday making. So when we were in Torino they told us all the people have gone to Genoa for holiday. So it was a Sunday and today they told us that all of them have gone back to Torino. This is all such a waste of time, waste of money and waste of energy but is introduced by some very clever entrepreneur an idea at least about twenty years back and everybody is mad. Nobody even thinks that why should we go like this every Saturday Sunday, what is the need, why not we sit down with our children, with our family, talk to them. They start any kind of game and people just follow them blindfolded. I can't understand why do they do it. Tomorrow they will say that there should be a game that we climb on these palm trees one by one. And people will do it. The problem is that a human being has to achieve that state where he knows absolute truth. If we do not know the absolute truth we will be playing into the hands of all these people. I have read a book on Freud calling his Freudian Freud where it is said that Freud had no scientific basis and the psychoanalysis has no meaning. He is another very learned doctor who has brought this point after such a long time. And the people would not listen. I told them long time back this fraud of Western Freud. At least in a country like Italy where mother is so much respected, how can you digest this man who says such a vulgar thing about the mother-child relationship? So as a result of that people just went into a rampage about their chastity, about their character, about their value systems. It had such a malignant effect on the culture and thought of people that they have lost all self-esteem and nobody is sure as to what they are. Despite all these things that we have gone through one has to understand that divinity is still completely intact there and that everybody is capable of becoming a spirit. When you become a spirit I mean to say that the light of your spirit comes in your attention. That first time you can feel this all-pervading power in your hands, on your fingertips. Only thing you have to use this power, learn it and you will be amazed how powerful you are. You become a very peaceful personality. When you are standing in the sea you are afraid of the waves but supposing you are in a boat then you are no more afraid. But supposing you learn how to swim then you can jump and save other people from getting drowned. But to achieve it you have to have self-esteem. You must know that you are a human being and that you are at the epitome of evolution. Because when you become the spirit then you know the absolute truth on your fingertips. It is not just a sermon or a lecture but actualization of the experience of your spirit. You feel from your fontanel bone actually the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming. Now we have the Father God Almighty, we have the Son and we have no Mother. We have just a dove there. Holy Ghost is a dove or a mystery. The Holy Ghost is the Primordial Mother. Some or other they did not want to give any importance to the feminine power. But not the Greeks. Greeks had Athena, Athena as their Primordial Mother. And we have in India also Adi Shakti is the Primordial Mother. Actually there is no word like Madonna in the Bible. It is from the previous religion called as pagan that this idea of Madonna came and people started calling the Mother Mary as Madonna. So this Primordial Mother is reflected within us as this Kundalini. So Kundalini is the reflection of the Holy Ghost within ourselves. And the Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty in your heart. When these two meet then only you feel yoga takes place, mean union takes place. And ultimately you are connected to this all-pervading power. This is your evolution for which you cannot pay. It is something so much your own birth right that you all have to have it. Because then only you can enter into the Kingdom of God. And then miracles, so many miracles, such a blissful life that you can't believe them. You yourself get rid of your physical, mental, emotional problems without any difficulty. Also you become collectively conscious. A new dimension in your awareness comes where you can feel the centers of others and you can feel your own centers. Most of the world problems are due to human beings and most of the human problems are due to these centers. If you can put these centers all right you can transform yourself and you can transform others also. So the nature of the Spirit is that first of all that your attention becomes active. Your eyes become innocent and wherever you put your attention it works for the benevolence of others. The second thing is that Spirit is the universal being. So you get rid of all your limitations of race, of color, of country and you become a universal being. You know the absolute truth. You know about everything. Not only that but you become drenched completely with joy. This is all your own and you all can have it. And today we are going to work it out. It will hardly take ten minutes. And if you can wait for ten minutes more we can work it out for you. For this you cannot pay, for this you cannot put in any efforts. It just works spontaneously. But one thing is there that after getting your sprouting or we can say the beginning of the awakening of the Kundalini and the breaking of the Sahastrara you have to become collective. You must get this connection established. And once it is established you will be amazed as to see how powerful you are. You become powerful, you become dynamic and you become extremely compassionate. You have to come to our centers, learn all about the Divine Power and its manifestation without paying any money. But you have to give some time to yourself and to your Self-Realization, understanding how important it is. Because it is for the emancipation of your being and of the whole world. It is not meant for people who have ego of their achievements, who are successful, who are very rich, but meant for the people who are meek in their heart. As Christ has said, meek in the heart will inherit the earth. Of course I have to tell you that it cannot be forced on you. It has to work through your free will. And you have to have pure desire to achieve it. Those who do not want to have their Self-Realization, please they should leave the place so that others won't feel disturbed. Those who want to have it will definitely get it. It's very simple because it is spontaneous, it's a living process. So the first of all we have to know there are three conditions. Very simple ones. The first one is that you all have to be fully confident about yourself that you will get your Self-Realization. The second one is that you are not to feel guilty for anything. If you have done some mistakes, it's all right. You should face it, but not settle it down as guilt. Because if you feel guilty, then this center on the left hand side gets very much blocked and can give you diseases like angina, like spondylitis and lethargic organs. So one does not have to feel guilty at all. On the contrary, I would like to tell you that this all-pervading power of Divine Love is an ocean of forgiveness. And whatever mistakes you might have committed, it can be easily dissolved by this ocean of forgiveness. Third condition is that you have to forgive everyone in general, not even thinking individually about them. Many people say that it is difficult to forgive, but whether you forgive or don't forgive, you do not do anything. But if you do not forgive, then you play into wrong hands. And then you torture yourself, while those who have troubled you are quite happy. Also while your Kundalini is rising, the center which is on the optic chiasma is very, very constricted like this. So unless and until you forgive, it won't open like this, it has to open like this. As soon as you forgive, it opens up. So all these years you have tortured yourself by not forgiving, and now at the time of your realization you are missing it. Such an important thing. So what's the good of it? So let us forgive everyone in general. Don't think about them individually, because it's a headache. These are the three conditions I hope you'll remember. Now please remember that we have to take help from the Mother Earth, so I'll be thankful that if you can take out your shoes. And now please put both your feet away from each other, because left and right are two different powers. It would be better if you people come down on this side. On this side. Please put both the feet away from each other. All those who are standing there must come and sit here, but don't watch others. Now please put your left hand on the right side. Put your left hand towards Me, like this. Left side is representing your desire to have self-realization, because this is the power of desire on the left-hand side, of ordinary desire. And the right side, the right side is the power of action which we'll be using for nourishing our centers. But please remember that this has to be done only today, tonight. You don't have to do it again. All right. Now you put your right hand on your heart. Where is the reflection of God Almighty? Now if you are the Spirit, then you become your own guide, your own master. So please put your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side, which is the center of your mastery. I have already told you that I cannot rouse over your freedom, which I respect. But you have to ask for pure knowledge. So now please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side, which is the center of pure Divine knowledge. So again you have to take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and in your heart, on your heart, and then in the angle of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right. Now you have to take your right hand on top of your forehead and bend your head as far as possible. This is the center for giving forgiveness to others, to forgiving others. Now you have to take your right hand on the back side of your head and take back your head as far as possible and look up. This is the center where, without feeling guilty, without counting mistakes, just for your satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness from the Divine Power. Now you have to stretch your palm as far as possible. Please bend back your fingers and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area. Now push back your fingers. It's very important. And put down your head as far as possible. Here you have to move your scalp seven times clockwise, very slowly. That's all we have to do. Now take down your hands, both of them. Put the left hand towards Me and put the feet away from each other and if there's anything tight on your stomach or in your neck, please loosen it. You have to be comfortable but you shouldn't bend or stretch yourself too much. Now please close your eyes and don't open them till I tell you can take out your spectacles. Now put all your hands on the left hand and all the hands on the right hand. It doesn't matter how long you take. On your lap you please put your left hand and close your eyes. Here you have to ask a very fundamental question to Me three times. You can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji. So now please ask a question in your heart three times, Mother, am I the Spirit? If you are the Spirit, you become your own master. So now please put your right hand on top of your abdomen on the left hand side in the upper portion and press it hard with your fingers. Here you have to ask another fundamental question three times in your heart, Mother, am I my own master? I have already told you that I respect your freedom and I cannot force pure knowledge on you. You have to ask for it. So now please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and press it. Here you have to say six times in your heart, Mother, please give me pure knowledge. Say it six times because this center has got six plexuses or we can call it six petals. As soon as you ask for Divine power, the Kundalini starts moving. Divine knowledge, the Kundalini starts moving upward. So we have to now nourish our higher centers with our self-confidence. So now please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Here now you have to say with full confidence in yourself ten times, Mother, I am my own master. This Divine power, I have already told you that you are not this body, not this mind, not this ego, not these conditionings, but you are the pure Spirit. Please take your right hand on your heart and here you have to say with full confidence twelve times, Mother, I am the pure Spirit. This Divine power is the ocean of knowledge, bliss and compassion, but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness. Whatever mistakes you might have committed could be easily dissolved by this power of compassion. So here you have to say with full confidence, Mother, you place your hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder. And here you have to say, please turn your head to your right and here you have to say, Mother, please believe that I am not guilty at all. Please say it sixteen times with full confidence. I have already told you whether you forgive or you don't forgive, you don't do anything, but if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands and at this time of realization you will miss it if you don't forgive because this center of optic Chasm won't open. So now please raise your hand to your forehead across and put down your head. Here now you have to say from your heart, not how many times but from your heart, Mother, I forgive everyone in general. Now please take your right hand to the back side of your head and raise your head fully upward. Here you have to say without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your own sake. O Divine Power, if I have done any mistake knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me. Say it from your heart, not how many times. Now take your palm, stretch it hard and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area. Now stretch your fingers backwards and put down your head. Here again I cannot cross your freedom. You have to ask for Self-realization. So please move your scalp seven times clockwise, put down your head, put down your head and now please say seven times, Mother, please give me Self-realization and move your scalp seven times very slowly clockwise. Now repeat, moving your hand, stretch your head, move your scalp seven times, put down your head, put down your head and now please say it from your heart, not how many times. Now repeat, moving your head, stretch your head, put down your head, move your scalp seven times. Now please take down your hands, open your eyes slowly. Please put both the hands towards Me like this. Now put the right hand towards Me like this and bend your head and see for yourself if there is a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area, the left hand you see. Please see we are moving your hand above, not on the head. Some people get it far also. Now please put your left hand towards Me. Again bend your head and see with your right hand if there is a cool breeze of the Holy Ghost or warm breeze is coming out of your fontanel bone area. If you have not forgiven then it would be very warm so please forgive even now. Bend your head, bend. Now please put your right hand towards Me and now bend your head and see for yourself if there is a cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. Now please put both the hands towards Me like this and watch Me without thinking. Now raise both the hands towards the sky, push back your head and ask a question. Out of all these three you can ask any one of them three times. Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? Mother, is this the divine power of divine love? Mother, is this the Param Chaitanya? Ask any one of them three times. Now please put down your hands. Now please put them like this. All those who have felt cool breeze or hot breeze in their hands, on their fingertips or out of their fontanel bone area, please raise both your hands. All of Jnana, may God bless you. You all have now become saintly. You have to look after now this saintlyhood. Now the switch finished. I finished eleven o'clock. They want to meet Me? They can come here if they want to. All right. I'm sorry there's a restriction on our time so I won't be able to meet you individually. I'm not sure if I can find the person in Italy. But I'm now living in Italy as you know in Cabela. And I'll be very happy if you people come to your follow-up and establish your Self-realization. They will tell you all about Sahaja Yoga, all about the Divine Law and you'll become masters in no time. And next year I hope to come back again. Even before that we might meet in Cabela. May God bless you. If you have any questions please write it down and send it over to Me. May God bless you all.

has to be taken up. Otherwise I tell you, some of you may start looking like Aurangzeb or Jangis Khan or Hitler or something like that. You see all these, suddenly I find thing among Sahaja Yogis, some Hitler standing with a mustache and a hair like that, the nose like that. Suddenly I find someone like that. It's quite possible. I mean what I have seen of Sahaja Yoga at the West, I'm surprised, you see. You leave somebody as a little sparrow and when you come back you find a hawk. Is that the same person? Yes, now she's become a hawk. Oh, wow! Only possible in the West, I can tell you. If you tell somebody in India, they will not believe. Like Mr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, only possible in the West. When I read this story I said, how can it be possible? Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, I said, how can it be possible? But I've seen it. It happens here. When they are good, they are very, very good. And when they are bad, they are horrid. But that's only in the West, you don't find this in India, why? The reason is we are deep into ourselves, very deep. All right, you have not missed anything now, because you got your realization as they have got it, you got the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga as they have got it. But test it upon yourself and humble down yourself, go down into yourself, facing yourself, just telling yourself, no, I have to be deeper and deeper, I'm not going to listen to anything. Ego and all that nonsense, I'm not going to listen, I'm going to go deeper and deeper. And move into yourself, embed yourself into reality, piercing through all these ego and nonsensical ideas that come from it. Then only you can correct it, otherwise you'll be alone. The best way in meditation I've seen to improve your ego is to meditate on My feet. My feet have that magic. Have you got photographs of My feet? I don't find anything here. You have, just bring one, just bring one. All right, wash them. So very small. Not this one, not this one. This is not this kind, another one, it's straight. Ah, see? I have recently closed. You are going to lie like that? Ah, that's it. They are reflecting to My door the light. Can we take out this? Yes, please. Get lots of these, all kinds they have. Change. Lighter? Now the second group can come in. Are you all right now? Better? Still there? Beat yourself with shoes, I tell you, beat yourself with shoes. That's the best way, go and beat yourself with shoes, all of you. Now those, come and just. Arson director. Very simple feet. Get some puja ones also. Okay. Now, no need to rub My feet, you can just wash them. Can you feel the vibration? Boy? Now let's have the second group come down. Please move out as you can be. Please move. Have you got kumkum here? Yes, Mother. Bring it. Those who have not rubbed My feet can rub with the kumkum, it will be good idea. Those who have not rubbed My feet so far should wait and others can meditate a little bit on the feet. Those who have not been put will come forward. Come this way. Come this way. Come a little lower. Some of them shake their little bit. Come here. Come here. Come here. Can you feel the vibrations now, the cool breeze? Put it in a katori or something. Put it in a... Now. All right? Good? They said, how are you? Better? Good. Now those who want to come further, come along. Now some others to come further. Come here. Come here. Just watch. All right? Are you better now? All right. Put up with Mother. Just try. Did you use the eyes? It helped you? It's right sided problem. Stomach, how you did it? On the liver. That also helped, at least. Now your breathing is all right. Virginia, you sit here. Don't close your eyes. All right? All right, improving? Face is improving, yes. All right. Hmm. Lovely. Feet, feet, continuously. You are not to think about them. You just have to see it. Oh. Hmm. Now another group. All of you have been all right? All of you all right? Now. Those who have not rubbed My feet before, come forward. Where's the kundukum? Or not had done My pujas. Come here, come forward. Now get the kundukum. All right. Come along. Take this and rub it on My foot. Come along. Happy darsi ajahn. Hold it. Hold it. Now. Their hands are cooler than My feet today. That's the best part. Left hand, left hand say pakalo, right hand say raguro. Sorry, pear. Nee jai. On the soul. I could make out. I think you've got a tremendous point. Rub it hard. Nee jai, nee jai. Pear kahan. Cook jor se raha. Apne wo dekha mare photo jo akash pe aaye. Nee dekha. Ah, dekha. Dekha tum hi. Ah, ek me to muni kal raajo ek photograph hai exactly. Oh, photograph hai na?

This car is going fast, another car follows it. All that turns into... Or else if you have a good actor, someone who is a good actor, he carries the film on his head. But mostly I've seen the very, very few good films which have any messages. But now Mr. Rajneesh has been exposed. He can show all these people in a film.

Sar pe chala hai aa, aa, aa, times in London. I had come out at Bevin, what was his name? Bernard Bevin. Bernard Levin. Levin, Bernard Levin. He wrote a big article about his niche. Now, those who have not rapped on, you are all right? Enjoy, yes. Be careful with your hands. You can rub it on your head, it's better. You have red-headed. You'll have red-headed legs. Both are armadage. It's very good. Come along now, you'll be so ever attracted. Now we can have something like that. Since you're going to get married again, you're married and ready to bless them. Oh, I see, good. All right. What about the pictures you wanted to show Me? Yes, Mother. I'm from India. I've seen photos of Me in India. I've seen videos of Me in films. What? Technically, I'm not sure. Yes, technically improved. But I've seen pictures of Me in the past. I've seen pictures of Me in the past. I've seen them in the past. What about them? I think they're very good. They're very good. They're very good. They're very good. Now let me see. Here, marriage is very good. All right, now. Is he here? No, he's not here, Shri Mataji. He's in California, San Francisco. He's going to India. Yes, Mother. This is very bad. Mother. Is there anything? Is there anything? Mother. Mother. Mother? I see. Yes. Mother. Mother. You're from Bangalore, right? Yes. I'm from Bombay. I'm born in Jain. Where are you from? I'm from Bharati. Bharati, I see. Which college? I'm from Vijay T.I. Oh, nice to talk to you. Vijay T.I. is a medical professor. Yes, I'm an electronics major. Yes, I'm a chemistry major. I see. Means what? Any nationality preference for no? I'm asking a question. Are you willing to marry outside of the US? Yes. Or Canada? Yes. To marry any nationality? Yes. Is there any nationality you don't want to marry? No. I mean, he's seen everything so much. Is there any particular person whom you want to marry? Yes. Gay. Gay. Gay. I see. That's great. But where is he? Where is he gone? Where is his mother? This boy? He's out in California. He could get here. Where did he meet her? Gayle. Where did he meet her? Where did you meet him? California. A few years. Oh, that's great. All right? That's very beautiful. So, he's solved. This one he's solved. This one is solved. This is him. Phil. This is Phil. He couldn't get a photograph but seen is his wife's ear. She has a photograph of herself. You brought one? Oh, good. Director? Yes. Of Broadway Studios, New York. What is the studio? Well, they make films. They make films. I see. All film people of the world. Yes, all film people, Shri Mataji. He's a director. Oh, that's good. Now we should make one film of seekers, all right? This is desire to humility. It's wonderful. Now see your vibrations, both of you, first of all. Beautiful. May God bless you. You should put one more point. Have you been to any guru? That's important. We have that on this board. Now, just see. Put your hands towards Me. Let's see. Better? Now, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, you see, how are you? Yes, I do. Now put it on your head. It will be good for such stuff. All right. That's five. Excellent. Richard is American. Thirty-seven. Are you still nursing, Richard? Richard. Rich? Rich. Are you still nursing? Yes, I do it part time. Aha. I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor. Indian, you would like to marry? Yes, Mother. That's good. I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor. Very good. This we have to consider. Is he here? Edward? Ed, Ed, Salkstead. He didn't, he didn't, he couldn't come. Canadian. I know. Some people couldn't come Shri Mataji, like a space. Absolutely. In that sense. I know. In that sense. He's so tall as six feet. Yes. Oh. What's the meaning of tadi? Tadi. Late. Late. Person who is always late. Like Me. You have a different way of doing it, Shri Mataji, different purpose. Distracted. Often distracted. Their attention is easily taken away from. Dead dreaming. He's been into drugs, Mother. He's been heavily into drugs. He's improved a lot. Laurie Heineck's person. He's in the ashram there in Vancouver. But he's had an up and down history. No, we'll find it somebody. He's very good. Godfrey. Godfrey in San Diego ashram. Yes. I'm speaking of America. Yes. Just children. Yes, Mother. Is he here? No, Mother. Again, another case of obscene. They were saving to go to India. And I think the difference between flying here and there may make a big difference. May make the difference whether you can go to India. So they didn't know you were going to be here, Mother. First it was Warren and Warren was going to go there. San Diego, sir. Mr. Christine. Yes, that's Christine. Yes, we have done. This we have done, Mother. Janet Bowers. Janet? Janet, come forward. Under the light. You go to the front. Okay. Artist. They are all filmmakers here? She brought them. Phil and Christine and all these others. They will make us from the department when she works. Now next. Next. Good. Good, is it? Sleep. Her feet have gone to sleep. Left-sided feet. Good? Yes, Mother. Very good. Extremely good. Thirty years of age. Same. More or less three years out there. Elizabeth? I've met her. She's there. Yes, I've met her. I know, I remember her. She has children? No, Mother. No, no, she doesn't. She's there. Very good. She's quite eligible. Hmm, yes. Caroline, I would like to marry you. Caroline? Did you hear that? I said, I would like to marry you now. Myself. You are so good. You are so good. Next. I'll marry you. You are so good. Yes. When were you divorced? In 1989. In 1969. You divorced or he divorced? You divorced. Hmm. Is he married? Both. Huh? Both. Hmm. Is he married? No. Not married. You don't want to give him another chance? How do you find him? Beautiful human being. Why not try Sahaja Yoga on him? Hmm? Better try. We come by, I'm saying. Your children must be missing the father. They have their father. They have his father. They're growing up now. Huh? Children are all 25, 23 years old. And professions of their own now. They're what? They're all working professionally in different fields of economics. They're very close to their father too. Father. Yes, both. Why not try him again? All right. All right? I have a feeling he's a good man. Oh, he is. He may come to Sahaja Yoga. All right? That would be a unique thing. You know my ego, Mother. Now it's not there. I think now your way may change. All right? Try him again. Not very much. That will be the best. I'll be very happy. Because it's a new precedent for people to show that those who are divorced again can remarry because after realization a person gets completely transformed and starts seeing the beauty of another person with a different anger. Isn't it? And all the hurts and all those past things are finished. This is? Lea. Lea. Lea. Lea. Leali. Leali. She's Lea? But only in India it's possible, Warren, what you said, that a master like this just falling at My feet like that. Only in India. Steam. In four notes he took all that. In four notes. I think all of you should learn little Indian music. It gives you a basic understanding of music as it is. Wow. Mmm. This song he must have sung at least hundred times. Every time a different style. Bhava pujanaakare. Without any shraddha. Bhava is the emotions. There are no emotions in it. Then how will you go beyond the bhava saagara, beyond the ocean of illusion? Shabha is all. Karimi is all. They all do pilgrimage or devapuja. And not with the heart. Shabha is all. Shabha is the energy. And not with the heart. And not with the soul. Shabha is all. Shabha is all. Shabha is all. Shabha is all. Shabha is all. Vahasana na mari. Vahasana. But the greed and the dust doesn't die. So what's the use? How will you cross the illusion? Just going to pilgrimages and worshipping God. Oh. Oh. And the earth is like a river. And God loves the surface as it is. And the earth is like a river. So... Yes, I see the food of Shabha. Yes, I see the food of Shabha. Yes, I see the food of Shabha. Yes, I see the food of Shabha. Shabha. Shabha. Yes, I see the food of Shabha. Yes, I see the food of Shabha. Whenever I speak you people catch on left to Shuddhi. That's very bad. I didn't say anything like that. I was making you laugh all the time. That's also Bhuti Shaiti, isn't it, to catch on to such points? Bhuta. Might be Kabiras. Kabiras are Sujato. He says that they wash themselves very well. In India especially, you see, they wash their body very well, they wash everything very well. What about inside is not washed? Yes, I see the food of Shabha. Yes, I see the food of Shabha. Yes, I see the food of Shabha. Yes, I see the food of Shabha. Shabha. Shuddhi, the other way round, you see. Why can't you take out vibrations? You have to see this too much. Then you put it here, this side, the line. Beautiful. Such big ones I have not seen before. What's that? Lamb. Lamb? The second one is even better. I'm settling down with the second one. Is it working now? Yes, Mother, it's flowing very much. I think this enticement, the sorrow, is described in the cameras and everything becomes in the... Left shoulder stands there. ...you start seeing everything in the witness state. You are in the fan body. Shri Shri Shri is very very important. Shri Shri is very important. Shri Shri is very important. Yes? You know, the one in Pandarpura, all Maharashtrians are devoted to Pandarpur because according to them Shri Krishna came and stayed there. So the one who stayed in Pandarina, there's my friend, lives, Shri Krishna. He sang this to you on your birthday celebration. It's different now, much better. Totally. Unbelievable. Pandarini masala, sikka khandra jna. Pandarini masala, sikka khandra jna. Pandarini masala, sikka khandra jna. Pandarini masala, sikka khandra jna. Pandarini masala, sikka khandra jna. Little sugar would be good because of the... or some diet coke all right. Have you got? Diet coke, take it. Diet coke. See I don't eat very hot things. Normally Indians like it but not Me. I don't eat very hot things. I don't eat very hot things. See, left sadhisana is a permanent catch, left adhya. Left adhya. Take tear off. Is the kaivari lakayamancha dung, English lak? Kaivari. Supporter nahi? Supporter pishah. It takes the sides of the... Takes the sides. It takes the sides of the bhattas. Stands by. Where are you taking your house? In a place called Mount Vernon. It's just north of New York. Is away from here, is far away? Not too far away. Good. It's closer, much closer than New York. Wawa. Wawa. One spoon will do. Wawa. Wawa. Wawa. Wawa. Wawa. Wawa. Combination of left abhi, left adhya. Left is the... Madhuri's little baby is sucking that one all the time. All the time he's sucking. Madhuri's little baby is sucking that one all the time. Shri Mataji! As induced by U primary memory. I think children must be catching from you all, that's why they don't want to see Tumba, among the certain people. They are looking better. Except for collectivity. Yes. I think children must be catching from you all, that's why they don't want to see Tumba, among the certain people. Yes. Mahadeva Bhagavan says, He is saying that, You have paid the debts of many before. Both ourselves many. He is saying that, You have paid the debts of many before. Better restore yourself also. Your Agnya is terrible. Kundalini doesn't go above this. I think the telephone system between you and God is not alright. Better put it right. Agnya is too much. Watch Me. Put your left to the right, because when we work very hard our Agnya catches. Put left to the right, seven times. All of you should try. All of you should try. I think in England they behave very well. He's here to, because he knows a lot about Sahaja Yoga, to teach you about Sahaja Yoga. You must have knowledge of Sahaja Yoga. That's very important. Because if you don't have the knowledge, you see the people don't feel impressed by you. You must know it. Left, Christi, left, right hand the Mother Earth. Don't get to the left, that's your weakness. How much air you are in? Long story. It's getting more intense, not less. Left, left again. Little half. Right. Now you see how your Mother has to suffer. You must all keep yourself clean, practice Sahaja Yoga, meditate every day and try to meet everyone as far as possible. That all creates problems. Better now. You must meet everyone, you see. That stopped. Try to meet as many as possible. Let's stop now. You've got pain in your head. Have you got a headache? I have. It's gone up here. Rub it, rub it a little bit. You face yourself, you see. Why do you develop an Agnya? Develop it because you think you are doing the work. Now better on the left. Now getting better on the left. It's getting better on the left. Now getting better on the right. Vivala, Vivala Chiyot. He says, who is a, you have paid off the debts of so many before, now who is going to pay off our debts? Because Shri Krishna is also Kubera, is the one who is the giver of wealth. Vivala Chiyot. Vivala Chiyot. Left hand, right hand. Vivala Chiyot. Vivala Chiyot. Vivala Chiyot. Vivala Chiyot. Wow. Face it. Not to feel guilty is very wrong way, attitude. Face it. Actually get, I get deaf sometimes, the way you people get it. The doctor has given me a earphone. Are you all right? Are you all right? We should leave. We should leave once. I better get back. Christine, I wanted to tell you about this program of going to India. I think, Baba, you are compiling all the names and everything. You. Now, and the list has not gone of marriages, which must be sent immediately to Gavir. I wanted you to see it first. Wanted Me to see it. We'll see that together there, would be better. Have you got it now? All right. So I'll see that and I'll see the people. That's one thing. Secondly, and the circular I hope they have written, that you shouldn't bring too many clothes there. Those who want to have saris, they'll get three saris and three blouses and three pedicures ready for them if they write it down. Have you written down like that? Yes, Mother. They have it and their measurements as well. All right. So. Anybody who hasn't given their measurements, I think most of you have. Make sure you give Me it today. Also for men, if you give us your measurements, we'll get your kurta and pajamas ready in time, because we'll not be in Bombay for some time. I think we'll never be in Bombay till you come back. So no question. Now, about money. How much have you sent? Is 180 of you sent? Everyone sent all of their money, Mother. Everyone should have sent. All of their money? Yes, all of it. Everyone sent the deposit, but most people have paid all of the money. The only thing they have to pay is the airfare and that they have to pay to be bet. That's different. That's pivotal. All that money should be paid. Now, about luggage. Again I say, don't carry too much, but you must carry some sort of a foam thing about two to three inches. That is quite light in your sleeping bag. That is something you have to donate to Indians. It's very important. Foam. Foam. It's thick. Thick as that. Rubber or foam, whatever you can get. Rubber would be expensive, no? No, really. Then better buy rubber. Rubber or foam, whatever you can get at the time. Then rubber is better. For Indian climate rubber is better. About three inches. It is covered with some sort of a sheet or something. Three inches, Mother, might be. Three inches thick might be quite a heavy one. No, no, not heavy. It is not very heavy one. The foam is not heavy. You see, they are not carrying too much luggage. Everybody can carry one as a... I meant for the buses. I meant for the buses. No, no, not for buses. The bulk. No problem. No problem for buses. I can get something else like a truck or something, you know, but the amount I have to pay. You know, what happens when you get anything from the people, they give you these, what you call, these mattresses there and I don't know, some people carelessly use them and you have to pay for the whole price of the whole thing and then it really tells upon us. Sometimes fifty, sometimes sixty is too much. So it's better you bring your own once for all and we'll manage it because we can always use them. Then we'll manage, don't you worry. I don't mind paying for that, but the load and all that. But in any case if you don't bring too many things, why don't you bring a small suitcase with few things in it, whatever you need, because Indian soaps are better than here, Indian toothpastes are better than here, everything is better than here. At the most the brush you might bring, toothbrush. A person walking out with a toothbrush is the best. I mean combs we get better, whatever you need you tell us. It gets you everything. Soaps, soap, we get beautiful soaps in India. I use always Indian soaps. Sand root soaps are beautiful, they're so nice for the skin and so good compared to all your expensive things. For washing your hair don't carry your shampoos. We have there very good shikakas and all that. Use them for a change, you see, they'll make your hair look better. They'll grow better, you'll like it. Anything like that you want we can get you and it's not much to pay also. Under clothes if you want to take you can take it, otherwise if you give us sizes we'll get you under clothes also. Pure cotton under clothes are very, very cheap in India. So don't carry too many things, there's no need to carry. Because whatever you get here is very uncomfortable to Me at least because everything is mixed with this nylon, this, that. You put your foot anywhere is nylon, do anything which is nylon, so it's not comfortable for a Sahaja Yogi. And even your soaps has some horrible chemicals, you see. I mean I just cannot use some of the soaps you have, like kameh. I don't know what goes wrong with it. So many of them this then this milk of ullai or something, that through lye business I cannot. Just gives Me rash. Now what else is to be carried like that? Just the suit they go there with Mother, just one suit of clothes what they're wearing and one sweater. Not two, two will do, two will do, but not suits. Suit only one at the most. I mean where will you get to the suits? You just wear this kurta peyamas, that's the best there. What's the use of wearing a suit in that heat to get all the boils on the body? Maybe a jacket or something. Sweater. Sweater, sweater, dirty sweater. Sweater is sufficient for India, don't have to carry coats and raincoats and amre glass. There's no need. So Mother, they virtually need to carry virtually no luggage. Virtually? They'll be wearing most of it when they go. When you can't wear two kurtas? No, no, but when they go, when they go Mother, on their journey out from here, they have virtually nothing with them, just an empty bag, empty bag and a bag of clothes. If somebody has got a kurta, they may like to take it, you see. But you can buy two kurtas for yourself, is good idea. They're buying, they normally buy about four or five. Four or five, all right. They want silk ones, Mother. One silk one. Four puja, because the last time we went there, we couldn't get silk ones till very last. No, no, silk one we'll have to order about. But if you give Me sizes, you see. This type of bottom, I don't know what they call them. What is that? Half, half, half pajamas. They're not churidas and they're not pajamas, they're half. They're called half pajamas. At the most you can bring long johns. I mean if you, everyone find it so cold. I don't know what you can bring, razors maybe? Electric razors are good. But where do you use electric razors? No, battery operated ones, Mother. We used the whole journey. Or a battery ones, all right. How big batteries? The kind of battery you bought for Me. That's a good one. Bring those kind. The battery is good, that's a good idea. Battery, what else? The battery is self-charging ones you're talking about, the ones you thought were good. You just plug them in and they charge up again. Plug, plug, you won't get it. You better bring where you can put the battery inside. Yeah, we put, didn't we bring batteries that? No, no, batteries that can be plugged or that way. Right, both ways. Both alternative. One each everybody must have a battery, it's very good. What else? Everything. We'll get you oils, everything. We'll get you oils, combs. Chappals they'll get. Chappals you'll get there, tooth press, tooth brush you must bring because I don't know, Indians are not very good at toothbrushes. We use, you see, other thing, Indian thing, which you may not like but is very good for the teeth. Maybe toothpaste if you are fond of any one of them. I don't know, what else can you bring? Do they need actually suitcases or soft bag, you know, big soft bag? Big, why? Well, in case you want them to bring something back. No, no, then you see you should buy one in India. Why don't you buy one leather one there? We'll order, they'll give you very nice leather soft box. Soft box? Oh yes, why don't you get a pure leather? These horrible soft ones here they go, give way no time. They'll give a nice one with a lock and everything. Pure leather, how many for that? Raise your hands, those who are going. One pure leather thing, those who are going to be there. It's good. Christine, why don't you come? I'd love to if we could afford it but I don't know if it'll be possible She wanted you. Why? Because of the house. Because of the house. He's there, what is he going to do? Let him do the house, what are you going to do with the house? The money. What's the money? Whether we have... They need her salary for the... Well, not just that, no, whether we'll have enough to pay for the trip and such. I mean, what a house you are buying like that. What's the use of such a big house, what are you going to do with it? Well, I don't know, I don't know. Well, maybe some people would come and live with us. Sahaja Yogis? Sahaja Yogis. Then it's all right. Then they can pay. If those Sahaja Yogis who want to stay with you can pay, because I think it's long time you have not been. Yes, it is. People have been asking Me why Christine has not come. It's such a old Sahaja Yogini like you, you see, they remember. This time Pat, all this old group is going. So I think you should make it. Yes, she let her come. Actually he also must, but you can go half way, he can come half way because Agnya is terrible and Sahaja Yogis will get after you, the Indian Sahaja Yogis. They'll give you a nice massage, I can see that. As soon as you come, they'll jump on you. They prepared My cup. Terrible. I tell you it's numbing, it's very bad. It's terrible. Just imagine this side there, this side there. Better now. This is still here. Here. Still here. So Nigala palya panramintaya tumita arva. That's right. Yes, that's right. Yes, that's right.

Sugar, yes. Little bit. Little bit. That'll be enough. One more. One more. One more. One more. One more. It's such a lot. I just want to do it so they all clear out. So I can clear out myself. It was the use. Should they put their left hand to you Mother, right hand on the earth? Right hand on the earth, left hand to you? Oh, this is all right. See, always remember that positive goes to negative, you see, so the connection is established. So on the left hand side if you are working, then you have to put right hand on the earth. So you have to put right hand on the earth. So you have to put right hand on the earth. You see, so the connection is established. So on the left hand side if you are working, then you have to put right hand and left hand takes it out. Put your left hand and you'll see the difference. Nothing. It's sucking it. You are sucking. See, nothing is happening. I mean, I'm sucking it. I'm sorry, I am sucking it. Now, just see the other one. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Now, just see the other one. See, see the difference.

No, too much that you should have to pull your ears now. I mean, it comes to that then what to do. It's here now. I don't think they can handle You being angry. Guilty, actually you don't think that. You are guilty. You are guilty. I don't think they can handle You being angry. Guilty, actually you don't receive anything what I am saying. Not to feel guilty. What is there? I'm not saying it to you because if you are the Spirit, I'm not telling it to you. But to something else that is not you. You are the Spirit. So how are you? All right. What about you? Where are those three lost souls? Lost forever? Horrible they are. What their addresses? Same. L.A. Two from L.A. and one from Monteria, San Francisco area. You see now if you go after them their ego will be pampered. As it is that too much ego. They don't mind living here as eat peace, taking drugs, doing all kinds of things. Also to say this is too much is also ego's expression I think, isn't it? Too much for ego only. All right. Good. God bless you. Still the right eye is too much, it's impossible. Pull it out. Better change. God bless you. This kind of a thing you want? Yes, that's it. Exactly. Same. Tight bottoms. Not big baggy ones. That one is... This style. Churidar. Not very tight also. Yes. There are some which were very tight and were no good. They split every time you sat down. And there's another tight which is too baggy. They don't look nice. They look like you're going to bed.

I can take some and read notes out of this. Now, you keep it with yourself, the second musician is going to come. Don't disturb the musicians. These are sahaja yogis, you don't have to give them money. I am not professional. Now, you can take some and read notes out of this.

Now, this is another style we call it as Gaurad. They are singing about Radha Krishna and the great saints on their side. And in this song, we sing that Radha Krishna has gone. That's what is the assurance you want to have. And in the fourth series, it's very interesting. But it's difficult to translate in such a short time. But the way you see is in the Vihagraha. The Vihagraha, now, you see because we all know the Radha, the melodies, everybody can sing it and expand it to whatever way it's like. So, this is a Vihagraha which I think I will ask him to just play. You're going up and going down on the scale. So, you just follow him. So, you will know one more Radha called as Vihag. This time, it's the same. That's Vihagraha. Now, it's time to sing.

Every night, every morning I think of you. Every deine call you to me. And one day an ugly face of mine, here and more dirty than that smile, ertens the whispering. You pure and pure at night all day. i confused Blue D schon. It is a very jealous thing.

Now we will be singing another pattern of music that we call a path. When I sing in this, I don't say any words, but it is the sounds of different musical instruments described in a very guilty way and it can be ultimately ended up with a very speech. So you can listen to this raga in Bihar Raja, the same raga is just the notes, but the notes are sound like the instrumental sounds. Try to understand, this is a very interesting part of the thing, that they end up with you sometimes, this is tarana, that is only the musical sounds, that's all. This is a very interesting part of the thing, that is only the musical instruments described in Bihar Raja. So in Bihar Raja, you can listen to a lot of different musical instruments, and you can listen to all the musical instruments, and then you can listen to the sounds of different musical instruments. That's the end of the part. That's the way it is.

The Cream Palsing kittyam. He got married to a king. And then he said, he's a girl called Akiyubhara. And he lives in this man. And he's the one who was married to Akiyubhara. And this is the third Rara, which is the Bhairaji Bhairav. It's another very beautiful one. He has son at the morning. But unfortunately, because he has no compulsion. He says, morning, evening, night. So my brother used to be very good at this. He used to say, this is a nice, authentic Bhairava. He's not coming tonight. That's all right. I'm a farmer. Thank you very much. Love it. Hello.

Now please put both your feet on both the sides, away because as I told you there's a left side and a right side. Left side is the power of desire, of the mundane desire and the right side is the power of action. At the very outset again I have to tell you that it's very simple, easy, will work out without any difficulties, don't have any doubts about yourself. There's another thing that there are three conditions which I must tell you, they are very simple and you have to understand them. Not the first one as I told you, you have to be absolutely self-confident that you are going to get your Self-realization. You are not a sinner, you are a seeker. Not all you are human beings, you are not God. Very human beings have to make mistakes, doesn't matter. At this moment second condition is you are not to feel guilty about anything whatsoever. This all-pervading power is the ocean of forgiveness, ocean and very powerful. Whatever mistakes you have committed can be easily dissolved and you will see the concern of this Divine power about you. You'll be amazed. So first of all you forgive yourself and know that you are not guilty at all. Do you know when you feel guilty what happens? This chakra on the left hand side catches and this is the chakra of America. It catches on the left side. As a result you might get spondylitis, you might get angina, you might get very lethargic organs. So what's the use of feeling guilty if it is going to give us so many physical and mental problems? If you have made mistakes, all of you face it and correct it and forget about it. But to keep it all the time hanging here, this has become a fashion also. You'll start feeling guilty for what is happening in Afghanistan. I mean you can't help it, can you? Why are you guilty about it? So in short you have to be pleasantly placed towards yourself. You are going to enter into the Kingdom of God. So you should expect all the blessings with a very enthusiastic heart. Then the third one is even a simple, very simple condition is that you have to forgive everyone. Don't have to think about that. Even to think is a headache. But logically whether you forgive or don't forgive you don't do anything. It's just a myth. But when you don't forgive then what happens? That you play into wrong hands and torture yourself while those who have troubled you are happy while you are torturing yourself for nothing at all. And this is a very important condition where you have to in general forgive everyone. Don't even think about that because this center on the optic chiasma is like that, absolutely constricted. Unless and until you forgive it won't open. As it is you have tortured yourself all your lives and now you'll miss out on your self-realization. So this is very important to forgive everyone. The blacks must forgive the whites, whites must forgive the blacks. Brothers must forgive brothers and sisters must forgive sisters and the fathers, the daughters and the daughters, the father, everyone. Forgive also these false gurus and forgive them. All those who have made money in the name of God who might have lynched you, forgive. No use thinking about them, useless people. This is very important. This is the last. Simple, just you have to say within yourself, I forgive all of them in general. That's all, I'll tell you when to say that. You'll feel much lighter. So now, as I've told you we have left and right side, we put our feet apart from each other. Now we put the left hand like this, symbolic that you want your desire, your self-realization. That's very important, all the time. I'm going to tell you today how you will nourish your own centers but this is to be done only today, later on you don't have to do, don't have to remember. Later on automatically everything will work out. So now you have to put your right hand on your heart. First we'll show you what is to be done. Somebody should come up here. Can you? Yes come along. Now, he'll show you, stand on this. You are going to show. Put your left hand on your heart. In the heart is the reflection of God Almighty and the Kundalini is the reflection of the Holy Ghost which is the Primordial Mother, which is the feminine energy of God Almighty. What we call as Holy Ghost in Sanskrit called as Adi Shakti, in Greece it is called as Athena. So when you become the Spirit you also become your own master. So you put your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen, which is the center of your mastery created by great prophets. Then you have to go to the lower part of your abdomen on the left hand side. You are only working on the left hand side. This is the center of pure knowledge of Divine laws. Surprising it is here it resides. But I cannot force pure knowledge on you as I have told you. Later on I'll tell you what is to be said. Now you raise your right hand again, the upper portion of your abdomen. Then on your heart. Then in the corner of your left and right, left shoulder and your neck and turn your head to your right. Now this is the center I have already told you that when it is in trouble you get all kinds of diseases. Then please take your right hand onto your forehead across and put down your head as far as possible. This is the center where you have to forgive everyone. Now take your right hand on the back side of your head and push back your head as far as possible. Now here without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, you have to ask forgiveness from the Divine power if you have done any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly, which I'll tell you later on how to say. Now last center, very important. Stretch back your hand or we can say stretch back your palm and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area and now put down your head as far as possible. Stretch it hard. You have to push back your fingers, this is very important. So there's a good pressure on your scalp and now move it seven times clockwise, clockwise. Push back your fingers, very important. No, no, no, clockwise, clockwise like this. Push back your fingers, that's very important. No, no, move your scalp, not your hand. Ah, good. Push it. Push the, now push back your fingers. Yeah, good. Seven times. That's all. That's all we'll have to do. All right, we got this. Still lot of heat already coming out. Doesn't matter. So, you are to be placed very pleasantly towards yourself to begin with, please, and have self-confidence. Now please put both your feet apart from each other and put your left hand towards Me and right hand on your heart. Now you have to close your eyes. Until I tell you, until I say, please open your eyes, keep them closed because the attention is drawn inside. You'll not feel anything. Some of you might feel little heat, that's all. But ultimately you will feel the cool breeze or maybe the warm breeze coming out of your fontanel bone or maybe on your fingertips. So now please close your eyes. Please close your eyes, put left hand towards Me, right hand on your heart and both the feet apart from each other. You need not sit very, with any strain, but you should not also slouch in front or push back yourself too much. To begin with you have to sit very comfortably straight. If there is anything tight on your neck or on your waist you can reduce the pressure. Don't say any prayer, any mantras or anything and don't force your mind to concentrate. Automatically the Kundalini will manage it. Now, here you have to say, you have to ask a question to Me which is very fundamental. You may call Me Shri Mataji or you can call Me Mother, whatever you like. So please ask a question here three times in your heart, Mother, am I the Spirit? I told you, you are working on the left hand side and if you are the Spirit you become your own master. So please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and press it hard. Here you ask another fundamental question about yourself, Mother, am I my own master? Mother, am I my own guru? Three times. I have already told you that I respect your freedom and I cannot force pure knowledge of divine laws upon you. You have to ask for it. So now please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen, press it hard and here you ask six times because this center has got six petals, Mother, please give me pure knowledge. Please ask six times in your heart. As soon as you ask for pure knowledge the Kundalini starts moving upward. So we have to now open the higher centers, nourishing them with our self-confidence. So now please raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side. Here you have to say with full confidence ten times, Mother, I am my own master. I have already told you that the fundamental thing is that you are the pure spirit. You are not this body, this mind, this ego, these conditionings, but you are the pure spirit. So now raise your right hand on your heart please and here again with full self-confidence say twelve times, Mother, I am the pure spirit. Now, I have already told you that when you feel guilty you develop all kinds of diseases and you are human beings. If you make mistakes, no use feeling guilty. After all you are not gods. And this all-pervading power which is the ocean of knowledge, bliss and joy is the ocean of forgiveness. And so whatever mistakes you have committed can be easily dissolved by this ocean of forgiveness. So please forgive yourself and put your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your head to your right. Here you have to say sixteen times with full confidence in yourself, Mother, I am not guilty at all. Please say it sixteen times. I have already told you that logically whether you forgive or don't forgive you don't do anything but you live with a myth which is torturing you and you are playing into the wrong hands. You don't have to think about the people whom you have to forgive but in general you have to forgive all of them. So now raise your right hand on to your forehead across and please put down your head as far as possible. And here with full confidence please say in your heart, from your heart, not how many times, from your heart, Mother, I forgive everyone in general, from your heart, not how many times, from your heart. With this you will develop Divine discretion, please. Now, please take your hand on the back side of your head and push back your head as far as possible. Here you have to say it without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction. Please say, Mother, if I have done any mistake, or you can say, O Divine Power, if I have done any mistake knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me. Say it from your heart, not how many times but from your heart. Now the most important center is the last one, the seventh center of one thousand petals. So please stretch your hand, stretch your palm fully, put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone in your childhood. Now please remember to push back your fingers, so that there's a good pressure on your scalp. Now put down your head as far as possible, put down your head and now move your scalp seven times, slowly, carefully, clockwise. Now, please take your hand on the back side of your head. Now, please take down your hand and open your eyes slowly. Now watch Me without thinking, just watch Me without thinking, you can do it. Now put your right hand towards Me like this, little higher, and put down your head and put your left hand on top of your head, but not touching it, away from it, above your head, and hold it, and see for yourself if you are getting a cool breeze like waves coming out or maybe hot. If you have not forgiven, that would be hot too, so please forgive. Some people get it very far, some people get it closer. Please bend your head, trust it, don't think it's an air conditioner or anything, just don't doubt yourself, see for yourself. Now, please put your left hand towards Me. Now, bend your head again, bend your head and please see for yourself if there's a heat coming out of your head or it's a cool breeze like waves or maybe the hot also could be like waves, just see. Again with the right hand once more, put your right hand towards Me, bend your head and see for yourself if there's a cool breeze coming out of your head. Bend your head please. Now, raise both your hands towards the sky like this, push back your head and you have to ask a question, one of these questions three times, any one of them, Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? Ask this question in your heart three times or Mother, is this the All Pervading Power of Divine Love or Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya, is this the Paramachaitanya? Ask any one of these questions three times in your heart. Now put down your hands. Don't doubt because this hall is air conditioned but when you start using this power you will know. All those who have felt the cool or hot breeze out of their head or on their finger tips or on their hands, please raise both your hands. That's New York, may God bless you. You've done it. You won't believe the whole world is watching you. People are praying in Australia, in Russia, everywhere for you and their hopes are fulfilled. May God bless you all. But now please remember that you have to be collective, learn all about it otherwise you may lose your Realisation. Please, we have a center here where you can meet people. I hope you promise Me that. Next year I'll be here, I'll be come after every year. But I hope you'll be all right and you are all welcome to come to India and to another place in Italy. Also we are having a big function in Turkey, wherever you feel like, you are all welcome. May God bless you. If some people want to meet Me, they would mind shaking hands with them, I'll be very happy. May God bless you. May God bless you. How are you? How are you? Look at her eyes. Sparkly. Look at your eyes too. See their eyes. You see yours. May God bless you. This is great. May God bless you, my child. May God bless you. May God bless you. May God bless you. May God bless you. Are you all right? Krishnaji, take it. It's been given to you as you walk out of this hall. So if you want to know how to maintain this and you can't maintain it without learning this, please take the address and it's every Tuesday at 7 p.m. depending where in New York. Thank you. Thank you.

I'll have a request for you. I think I'll be better off there. You are taking home, I'm sorry. He's always, he's always there with a shotgun. Please, please make yourself comfortable. Is, is warm enough in this room? We can open a door too, but do you think it's too warm? I don't know, ask them, I don't know. It's comfortable with Me. All right. So now, please have your tea first of all. That's why I was waiting. They told Me they are having tea, please. Oh, that's kind of you, but I've already had plenty of tea and coffee for today. All right. Have you had tea? I have had, thank you, thank you. Mother, we will have a little interpretation here. So, now. I don't know how you want to do this. You just want to. Oh, you need to interpret, they need to interpret for Carol. Oh, I see. So they'll go. Yes, yes. And so how do we do it? Well, why don't you start and then I'll have one later. Yeah, yes. Carol has a presentation. Oh, sure, sure. That's how it's done. That's just like Chinese, you know. I've been to China mainland three times. Long time back, I think I should have started in the year 1976, then 82 and about two years back, only. Just before this problem. Two years before. Yeah. So. All right, we're going to start. From reading just your press material and what was provided here, I had a bit of a difficult time trying to determine how your, the practices that you use, how they're different from other yoga techniques. Is it more of a, do you concentrate on the spiritual aspect of it or is it more of a kind of a Spiritual. You see, it is very simply could be understood with an analogy like this, you see, that when you start a car, it is to be ignited first. So automatically all the machinery within you starts working. The first thing is the ignition. But all these modern ones are, before the ignition they move the wheels, they move the steering and all that and that spoils people. So the ignition has to be started and that is with the energy we have within us called as Kundalini in the Sanskrit language and Kundal means a coil and this is the energy of pure desire within us, of the pure desire because all other desires if you see according to economics in general are not satiable. So this is one desire which is pure and this desire whether you are aware of it or not is you have to be united. Am I too fast? Am I? To be united with the All-Pervading Power which is the Divine Power. So when we are seeking the truth, we have to know what is the truth first of all and the first thing is, the first thing, the truth is that we are not this body alone or we are not this intellect or emotions or our conditionings or ego but we are the Spirit, pure Spirit. It's the first truth. Second one is that all living work, like these flowers we take for granted, we take our evolution for granted is all done by a very subtle power which is All-Pervading. But going back to My original question, I was just wondering whether the emphasis is on the spiritual aspect or whether it's on the physical aspect? You see, first the Spirit and the rest of it works out automatically. As I told you, automatically the car starts working. First the Spirit, first the Source, tap the Source like every instrument has to be put to the mains. I saw from the material that you're a former medical student yourself. What kind of things do you think that Western science can learn from Eastern practices? You see, the Western science, the Western science, the Western science, is the way of learning. It's not just the Western science, it's the way of learning. The Western science can learn from Eastern practices. You see, the Western science that is existing today is treating people on symptoms. For example, if there's something wrong with the tree, you cannot treat it through its leaves, you have to go to the roots. Well, I guess in the Hindu culture and in Indian culture there's more of an emphasis on the total individual than the total person. Is that something that you try to run? It used to be individual once upon a time, I would say long, long time back because on the tree of life there were very few flowers but now it's a blossom time and so many have to become. Everything that we discover has to become collectively known and this is the last breakthrough of our evolution. So, in every evolutionary process there has been only few who came out, first of all, and then the shells of fishes came out. So, it's an evolutionary process, it's a living process within us and this is the last breakthrough. So, You're implying that man's spiritual growth is an evolutionary one, do You think? Of course, it is. That's the... Why are people more spiritual from one generation to another? We have learnt a lot, you see, sort of, we have gone through lots of things and we have learnt a lot now. This is the special time for that. Also the modern times are full of lots of confusions and problems, many more that people had before. So, the seeking is really very collective now and the people have taken advantage of it, all the people have taken advantage of this. They know there's a market, sort of a thing for such things. Do you want to ask a question? One thing I'm curious about is, why is it, do you think, that so many Europeans and Americans really flock to Hinduism, Buddhism, what is the attraction there for people in Western societies, especially nowadays? They are seekers, they are seekers of truth, you see, they are seekers of truth. And wherever they can get it, they would like to jump at it. But they must know, Hinduism is the same as Christianity is. You see, just it's changing from one to another, that's all but there's no truth in this, the way people are spreading Hinduism or anything. It's so artificial, it's so outside, it's man-made. Oh, so you think that the delineations between different kinds of religions are artificial? That's one of the things that proves that it's not true. If there's one God, there cannot be any difference between one and another. All this fundamentalism is a nonsense, absolute nonsense, in any religion whatsoever. I was Myself born in a Christian religion in Avashakh, the way it was. I think Paul was the one who really finished off Christianity, Paul and then he incarnated as Augustine, I think, because they are just the same type of people and made it so organizational and so dead. Yeah, well, I guess St. Paul has had lots of detractors. Oh, so I think, and he was epileptic, you see, himself a epileptic. He had killed Stephen who was a very good, what we can call a Christian and who was a disciple of Christ, direct disciple. Paul never even met Christ. How is he in the back? What right he has to be there? Tell Me, who's the most spiritual person you've ever met? spiritual person and you see, there's no quantum about it, they're not put into quantity but I would say, in your country you're Abraham Lincoln who was a very spiritual man and today living, I would say, Gorbachev is a spiritual man. Mahatma Gandhi was a spiritual man. They rise above the normal things and they change and transform. What is it that makes a person spiritual? I mean, how can you develop your spiritual? A person who is spiritual has got special powers, specially in Sahaja Yoga. I don't know those who are born realized, all of them have awareness of that or not but a person who is a spiritual person can be in two categories. One who is honestly and ardently seeking the Spirit and another is one who has found out the Spirit. One who's honestly and ardently seeking the Spirit and one who's found the Spirit? And one who has become the Spirit, who has been twice born as Christ said. It's an actualization. It's not an artificial certificate that we are twice born. Now the The one who is seeking knows one thing, should know who's ardently seeking and honestly that you can't pay for God. How do you become the Spirit though? I think that's it. I was born like that. So is it predestination or? So is it predestination? Yes, yes, it's all predestination. Well, that, that, it almost sounds like Calvinism in a way, doesn't it? The idea that Calvinism is also the same thing, they talk but they don't achieve. You see, talk, talk has been too much. So you think it's to become one with the Spirit, it's almost a matter of predestination, it's just that's not, that's not so. Because, of course, in a way that, you see, a person who seeks himself must have seek, must have sought it long time back before also and must have realized. I hope she's following Me, I don't know. But the one who's finds Spirit has powers. First of all the human awareness is not sufficient enough to know the Absolute Truth because that's why there are problems as you asked Me why there are differences, you see. But when you have the Spirit then you are collectively aware first of all you are aware collectively, we call it Collective Consciousness about which Jung has talked, Jung has talked about it. Even in Koran it is written by Mohammed Sahab that at the time of your resurrection you call it Kiyama, Kiyama. At the time of resurrection your hands will speak, your hands will speak and in Sahaja Yoga when the Kundalini pierces through your fontanel bone area and you get the actualization of the baptism we can call it, you start feeling on your finger tips the different subtle centers of other person and yourself. So your awareness gets a new dimension. I mean it's not just certifying someone or sort of uh.. uh.. proclamation or anything but it just, it happens to you in your being itself, in your central nervous system. Is also clearly described even in Vedas that it is a Bodha, Bodha means to feel it on your finger tips or to feel it on your nervous system. That is Bodha from where Buddha, what has come Bodha, Buddha is Veda itself, Vida also means the same thing, Vida, the word Vida also means the same thing but as all religions have deviated from the right path of finding their Spirit with all these things, writings you see, they have all deviated. I know you have a background in Madison, so can you explain from the Madison viewpoint to explain how, what's Kundalini? Explain what? What is Kundalini from a medical standpoint? Oh, medical, of course. In a medical terminology they haven't got this word as Kundalini but there's one very thing, very remarkable thing is that the Kundalini resides in the triangular bone at the base of the spinal cord and it is called as sacrum, that means sacred. In Greek language it is sacred, that means Greek knew it's a sacred language, a sacred bone. You see, that's what very significant thing I found but there is no mention about it because so far as I said that in medical science we approach from outside and this is the science of the roots. But in India people knew about it thousands of years back and even the Greeks knew because Athena, atha in Sanskrit means the primordial, primordial. Yeah, and in her hand there's this energy shown. If you see the statue of Athena, she has this energy in her hand, shown like a snake. I understand that you've been working with some doctors and that uh.. We have two doctors in India who have got their MD for curing, curing asthma and epilepsy and there's one doctor who has got MD on physical ability of her Sahaja Yogi and others. But now you see, Russia, I don't know who Russians are, very quick to pick things. It's very different in Russia, they invited about 800 doctors when I was there from all over, talked to them about Kundalini, they said, first give us realization. And this Kundalini is the one which rises through six centers within us. These six centers have the subtle centers, subtle centers which looks after a physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being. So when she rises, she nourishes all of them, first of all and then she gets connected to the vital energy which starts flowing all the time. And it is spontaneous, it's a living process like as you put a seed in the Mother Earth, the seed has the power to sprout and the Mother Earth has power to help. So it's a living process, it just spontaneously happens. So as a result of that, these centers, now for example this is the center, you see, you can see like that and this is the left and the right side of the sympathetic nervous system. The central one is the parasympathetic. If you start using this energy too much, what happens? It starts moving like that. Then suddenly something happens, it breaks, say a shock or something. So the connection with the whole is lost and that's how you develop diseases which are called as psychosomatic like cancer, all these incurable diseases, even AIDS and they can be cured. They all can be cured with the Kundalini awakening which is the power within yourself. With your own power. Well, if it's possible then how can people have him cure themselves from AIDS or... You see, in your country you can't even talk of cure, you'll be arrested. In all the western countries this is the problem and in India anybody who has, who has AIDS cannot enter in. But I've cured people in Australia. Of what? Of AIDS. Using Kundalini? Yes. Through meditation though? No, no, it's the, you see, just through, you see, they have to sit before Me, I must say, or could be even My photograph has that coefficients. My photograph has that coefficients that emits vibrations and they can work it out with the photograph. Have you had any doctors working with cancer patients, AIDS patients who've had a... We have, we have at least four or five blood cancer patients completely cured. But you see, Sahaja Yoga is not for curing people, it's a by-product. Yes, I mean it's not a hospital thing, it's a by-product. We are busy giving realization to people and those who get realization get cured. Yes, it is, it is fantastic. Human-beings are fantastic things that God has given us. We are not aware about ourselves. We are glorious. I give an example of a, say, take a television or a, or take a television to some remote place in a village in India. And they'll say, just some sort of a box, you see, but you put to the mains and they'll know what it is. When you are put to the mains, they will discover how glorious you are. This you call it. I must learn Chinese but it's a very difficult language. How long does it take to come to the, to find the realization? Oh, just that moment, that moment, it's not difficult. In the masses people get it but you must fix your connection properly. That takes little time and in that people fizzle out. Not Russians, I must say Russians are serious people. Russians are serious and also Chinese would be. I've not yet approached the Chinese but I know Chinese would be very much because I know Chinese are very wise people, very wise and deep. Also Greeks are, Greeks, Italians, Egyptians. Mother, since You mentioned about Russians, I know that You have just been to Russia and had a lot of audiences. Oh, tremendous! I think since You mentioned it now, would it be possible that You would talk a little bit about Your experience and how it went in Russia? All right. First time I went to Russia from Helsinki and Helsinki was such a bad experience, you see, very poor. Then I went to Neningdad and they had never known about Me or nothing. They had put some advertisement, I think. And the hall was for two thousand people and two thousand were sitting outside and two thousand were sitting inside. In Helsinki? No, no, Helsinki is hopeless. Helsinki is hopeless. I'm saying Neningdad. And then I went inside and I talked to them. They all asked for realization and I was surprised there were people from the Supreme Council, Ministry of Supreme Council. I mean, there were ministers sitting in front. I didn't know that. Later on they told Me. And they haven't got ego at all. I mean, you may be anything but they have no ego, no ego at all. Everybody sits in the same level. They do not feel that I'm something higher, another one is lower, nothing. And then when I walked out, all the two thousand were sitting outside. I felt very embarrassed. I said, now what to do? They said, what about us Mother? So I said, now do one thing tomorrow morning if you can come, I'll come outside. It was a big compound outside. I said, I'll come, we'll meet you. Next day all of them, two thousand from inside and two thousand from outside were there. I just can't imagine. But later on they were saying about the Eastern block, you see, was going to come for a yoga seminar. So My husband said, what's the use of yoga now? You have been already. I said, no, I must go because if the Eastern block is coming, I may be able to trigger something there. He said, how will you manage it? Let me try. So went down. They went down and they were all of them there, no doubt. And I spoke about for thirty-five minutes and in ten minutes they all got realization. And when I came out of the hall, all of them were out with Me, all of them. There was nobody to listen to another evening. I said, what are you doing? Aren't you going to listen to Him? No, no, no Mother, tell us at this. They all sat down on the staircase, discussed with Me, took My address, everything, when are you coming to Romania, when are you coming to this and that. And amazingly, just after that eight days or so, the Berlin wall fell. There were people from Berlin also. But Romania recently we have received a message that eight thousand people came for a Sahaja Yoga program, when I was not there. Poland also. How many in Poland in the world? Two hundred and fifty. Poland, what other place was there? Bulgaria. Bulgaria, two thousand. Yes, two thousand. And they are following it up. I mean, whatever have been their regime, I have nothing to say about that part, politics also. But definitely the people are very wise. I've been working in America for the last, the first time I came was in 1973. Nobody would listen to Me even. Do you think that the climate has changed since then, that people are more receptive to Your ideas or? We have only about hundred and twenty people all together in the whole of America. But other people like, you see, anybody tries to be fooled them and I've also belong to another society which we can call as Elisotiety. And there they talk like this, you see, this guru is expensive but he's good. You see, so, I mean, I just don't understand them really. Mother, what do you think about, this might be, you know, I don't know whether you know, Sheerin McLean, she is a famous actress. Oh, she came to My program in 73. But she has been writing articles. Oh, she is using all My words and all that. But she doesn't give realization, no. But is it, was she believes the same as Sahaja Yoga or it's another program? She, you see, she came to My program, I remember her, she came to My program. First time when I came, lots of these actors and actresses came. I remember her name, we have got her name also with us. But, you see, then they started using all the words and everything, they all became big gurus. There's one fellow called Dhavai who did the same. They're making money out of it, you see. How can it be Sahaja Yoga? Tell Me. Because She had written books and tapes about yoga, meditation. I wonder, do you think that helps the American public not to? It's all artificial. You can't pay for it. You see, if you make a business out of it, cannot do it, you see, cannot. There's another one I was telling you, Dhavai, he started a Sahaja Yoga thing near San Francisco or something. But I can't understand him. How does your yoga practices, do they stem from Hinduism? No, no, from all the religions, all the essence of all the religions, not at all. Christ is a very good example is that He resides in a very important place here on the optic chiasma where the Kundalini has to pass and like the gate He is. You have to pass through Him. But it explains what Christ is and it explains everything and also you can find out about Christ. If you want to ask, if you ask a question, Mother is Christ the Son of God. You get lots of vibrations. But Christianity is absolutely perverse. His message was never the cross, His message was the resurrection. And He suffered for us and He died for our sins. So why should the Christians suffer now? But they don't, I tell you. They don't, they make others suffer more. What happens after you've achieved realization? You become powerful yourself and you start giving realization to others. So you get cured, you feel much better, you feel much younger. See now, my age is now 67 years and I travel if you see My itinerary. Can anybody achieve realization? Of course, everyone, everyone is capable. It's not a matter of predestination or anything like that? Most of them, but if you have been to false gurus and things and for a while it is difficult because Kundalini is hurt. She is your Mother, you see. She is your individual Mother. She knows all about you and She does the job very well. But if you have been to some gurus or something, you have spoiled it spiritually or you are identified with something wrong or maybe if you are sick physically or maybe also sometimes that you have problems with your parents and things. I mean, some sort of a deep rooted problem if you have, then she takes time. But it can work, it works out because she goes to places where you need help and then ultimately you get it. But first she'll attend to the problems where you have problems. Supposing you are a liver patient, supposing. So it will go to the liver and you can see the pulsation near the liver. You can see. Also you can see in so many people the pulsation at the triangular bone if one of the higher chakras are constricted. Then you see the pulsation with your naked eyes, you can see. You can even see the rising of the Kundalini like an energy flowing through. Do you think everyone has the same ability? Yes, can everybody get it? Of course. But everybody won't come to Sahaja Yoga, no, they won't. The problem is that maybe someone much strong and someone that weak is the same. There are differences, no doubt. But still everybody can get it, we can try on. Practically I do not think of anyone who hasn't got it, who came to Sahaja Yoga, Thank you, thank you very much. Mother, for those nations where people respect mothers more, like the other land you mentioned about Chinese, mothers are the utmost importance in life and other nations like Italian, the family is the most important thing to them. Do you think it makes a big difference in the way that we live in the world? Do you think it makes a big difference? Of course it does, it does. Because, you see, in the family the child is brought up with so much of sense of security. If the child is in security childhood, then there is one center which gets very much constricted and you cannot raise the Kundalini till you have cleared it out. There's a center for the father, center for the mother, all these things work out. But if you had a very secured childhood, it works much faster. It's very important. Family life is very important and proper sense of responsibilities of the mother and father and proper respect, you see, of their duties. If the housewife is treated just like a maid servant, all women want to work and they think that we are treated so low, you see, but if they are treated like something special. Now to achieve realization, it's through yoga or are there any other methods that women use? No, this is the only way, you see, just you have to put your hands, just like namaz it is, put your hands like this and you do get realization with that. Simple as that. But later on, supposing you are realized soul, you can also raise the Kundalini. They are doing now. It's, anybody can do it then. But I'm curious about the process that you require realization, is it through meditation or through? No, no, nothing. You are in meditation then. You don't do meditation, you are in meditation. There's not much of a process in it. Once you get realization, then you have to just find out what sort of a personality you have. If you have a left-sided personality or if you have a right-sided personality, then there is a way of working even on My photograph to get the balance. The balance has to be there. But then how is it, I mean, if it's so easy, if it's not hard then it's so fatal, you see, whatever is very vital, whatever is vital is very easy always if you see our breathing is so easy. It's so vital, it has to happen. It cannot be difficult. So, you're saying that it's not difficult to come to realization that... And even to master it and to understand it, it's not difficult. But only problem is that we have conditionings that how can we get it free, you see. Like the BBC people told Me that we can't believe anything. Anglo-Saxon brain cannot understand anything that is without money. I mean, just imagine. I said, who has made this brain? God has made or somebody else has made this Anglo-Saxon brain. How much did you pay to Christ, first question? For His work. How much did you pay to Christ for His work? Fundamental question. Mother, for those who are reluctant or do not believe in... You can't force it. You just can't force it, you see. You have to come in your own freedom. You just can't force it. You cannot be forced. But if there are people who are close to us and I have benefited from it and I'd like them to be able to benefit different too, what can one do to... They will see you is changing. They will see you feeling better and they will come. But you can't force. You should never force anyone. Because it won't work, I tell you. It won't work. It's a living process. It's not a mental thing that you can convince someone. It has to work, you see. And there's no guarantee. No guarantee also. Question from Carol. Sahaja Yoga has been developed more than 20 years. Any reason why you've never been in China and Taiwan? Oh, it was. Sahaja Yoga was worked out long time back in China, very much. What about Tao? Tao is nothing but Kundalini, absolutely. I actually went by Yangtze river to see how we described it because the surroundings of Yangtze river so beautiful. Every five minutes you see a new change in the whole thing. But that's what is suggested. That you should not get tempted by all that. Just move. Tao is absolutely Sahaja Yoga. Yes, Tao is the natural thing. Of course, I mean, just the... This absolute Tao is this Zen, Zen in Japan. Is absolutely Sahaja Yoga. Zen means dhyana, means meditation. Zen is absolutely, but I mean, it's such a sad thing that those people who proclaim something have nothing to do with it. The head of the Zen came to India. He was very sick, so they felt embarrassed and they took Me down to him, to cure him. I said, how is, sir, that you are the head of Zen and you are not a realized soul? They call it, to a realized soul they call it a Kashyapa, Kashyapa. So I said, how are you not a Kashyapa? He said, do you know that from the 16th century to the 12th century there have been only 26 Kashyapas. After that he never had any. He admitted. So after 12th century what have you been doing? And also I tell you now, the Chinese government as it is, believes in Confucius, in the Humanism. Confucius was the beginning of it, you see. You can say Socrates also, same thing. Socrates has talked of the gods and everything. But Tao is the one who went subtler into it. What Confucius wanted to establish collective consciousness, in Tao it is that only through the Tao you can achieve it, means by realization, automatically. You cannot, you see Me say, you see, we are all brothers, sisters and all that's not so. It has to become part and parcel of your being. You have to feel that you are part and parcel of the whole. That's not the feeling mental or emotional or anything but it's actually on your finger tips you feel it. We know the Buddhism was introduced to China from India and there are connections with philosophical thoughts between Chinese beliefs and Hindu beliefs. For Chinese, what would you say, because we are arranging for you to go to Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China next year. This coming September. For Chinese, what do you think, do you think if we explain to them this is the connection between Tao and Zen? Of course, it's Tao. It's Sahaja Yoga is Tao, simple thing as that. Zen is Tao and Tao is Sahaja Yoga. There's no difference at all. Only thing difference is that it is working on collective level now. You see, like somebody is holding on to a snake, say for example, in the darkness and you tell him about Zen or Tao, he'll say, no, no, this is not snake, this is a rope only. Because he won't get his light to see it, you see. He'll still believe in the snake as the rope, you see. So what I thought of that, if you can raise the Kundalini, you see, then even if there's a dim light, he will see the snake and he'll drop it himself. So you become your own master and you start correcting yourself. I don't have to bother him. I don't say anything. I don't say don't do, nothing of the kind. All these ten commandments, I keep it on the back side. When it happens automatically, you follow that. How about for the practical sense as meditation, as a practice? I understand that some Chinese meditation that people practice, that they have warm feelings through their bodies to heal different parts. But for Sahaja Yoga we have actually... Cool, cool feeling, yeah. No, no, warmth is never a sign of health, never. See, if you have a cancer patient, if you are treating that patient with sahaja yoga, you don't have to use a heater, even the coldest place like England. So the heat is the sign of disease. Now if you heat the helium gas, it's a scientific proof, if you heat the helium gas, then the molecules, they start fighting each other. But if you cool it down, helium, then they become collective. We do know for a real example which Nelson knows, it was a person that he brought to our center in New York and he come to meditate for once and he felt the coolness and he got scared so he never come again because he is used to the warm feeling. That's right. Warmth comes by, warmth comes by the sympathetic activity which leads to another problem. It leads to another problem, it's the cooling. And you see, even business people become so tensionless, you see, all tension, everything goes away, worryless, they see the problem so well because they are out of that problem. You see, they can see, they become witness of the whole thing and they become great business people. I mean Sahaja Yogis, we have some very big tycoons in India and everywhere and they are so relaxed, not bothered. Everything working out very well. How do we better prepare Chinese people before your coming? I think either Miss Tang or myself could write articles starting to, before you come to come here. You have to tell them this way that you keep your minds open like scientist, you see. You must have an open mind to begin with, you see, because before denying anything or defy anything, keep an open mind. You don't have to pay anything, nothing of the kind and now we have proof that we have so many doctors who got MDs and there are seven doctors in London who are doing this work. But despite that, whatever I am telling you, you need not believe Me at all because blindness is not going to help. You need not believe Me but treat it as a hypothesis, you see, the scientific hypothesis and then if it is proved, then you accept. Then you have to be honest, then you have to be honest because it's for your benevolence. It is for your benevolence, for the benevolence of the whole world. Like, see, My husband used to say that you are something I know differently but I don't think you can make anyone like that. Now he's seen so many, he says, now in my own honesty I cannot see, it's not so. He says, I cannot, I mean I see so many people. Not only that you become dynamic, in the material world you become also dynamic in your intellectual world. People who could never speak a word on the stage have become great orators. Then students who were supposed to be very weak in studies have become first class students. It's a complete new dimension, your brain opens out because just now we are in a world where we are not able to see. Just now we are using a wee part of our brain. Then the, such a lot is available to you, such a lot of knowledge. Question from Carol. Can I may be being interpreted as Jintuli, later Tan dynasty, it's around 700 AD, for almost 1200 years up to now you are the only one openly teach everybody reach to this level. But how about other country, Eastern country, it's Japan and they, are they, where they recognize that's a level been mentioning in Russian books. Japanese are having a trip now. They have to finish their trip then they will understand. They are, you see even their own things like you see they have known, it's a very wonderful thing is unknown, where they put these things on their faces and have a play. So they said, oh it's too deep, too deep for us, too deep you see. Anything? Then Zen, I tried to explain to them what is Zen is. Oh too deep, too deep, too deep. Everything they avoid what is deep. But you see you have to go to your depths otherwise you cannot solve your problems. Japan is having so many problems which they are not telling you but they have drug problem, AIDS, such a small country has so many problems. One, this Yepi's disease is already there which I told about eight years back. I had told about AIDS also long time back and I had told about, predicted about this Yepi also business in America and it has started. So all these will, once, once it starts coming up then they come to their senses and start thinking, oh what are we up to? Money is not going to give us anything. The circle system we mentioned in Sahaja Yoga also be mentioned in tantric. Is Sahaja Yoga, all those concepts, can be considered part of the tantric? Part of the? Part of the tantric. Part of the tantric. Yeah, somebody can do anything they like but you see just the opposite of tantric it is. Actually it is said in the Vedas that after getting realization very clearly you must know the mantra, tantra and yantra three things. The first one is mantra, means when a Kundalini stops at a place, supposing it stops at Agya, you have to say Lord's prayer, whatever you may try. It has, you have to say Lord's prayer but only a Sahaja Yogi can do that because he's connected. So that's the mantras you must know. Then you must know the yantra means you must know the mechanism, the whole thing, chakras and the nadis and all that. And the last thing is the, what you call the technique, that is tantra. These you have to know, these three things but after realization. But the tantricas are just the opposite, they don't know anything. It's like somebody who is not a surgeon and having doing surgery. These parapsychology, these tantricas, all these gurus, everyone, all of them are like that. The other day we had about eight or nine people in Florida, they were all Indians. None of them got realization and all the Americans got it and said, we are ashamed of you. See, this is your heritage because they've been to so many gurus, tantra, mantras, they've done all kinds of nonsense and I said, they said, Mother, we want it. I said, if you really want it, then give up all this nonsense. And they have got ten gurus in their house put like that and all this. So, you don't use mantras in Sahaja Yoga? No, no, mantras are to be used. Like I said, Lord's bread is a mantra. Allahu Akbar is a mantra. But it's not the key then? It is, when the Kundalini rises, She passes through different centers and these centers have got deities which are to be opened up and that's what you have to awaken. For example, if you have a problem in your throat here, you should be chakya. You have to say Allahu Akbar, means God is great because this relates to the, what should we say for Virat? Father aspect. No, not Father aspect, much. Although the all the cosmic greatness of the Divine. Yes, cosmic greatness you can call it. God's cosmic greatness. In Taiwan now, as I just been there, that I had spoken with quite a few people who had been practicing yoga with different gurus. And so I think I like to, I don't know whether it's the right term to say prepare you that there will be different people had already been practicing yoga. I know, I know. But how do we explain to them the difference? You should say, you should say, what have you achieved? You see a simple thing, I say I'm your Mother, alright? Then I would like to know what your guru has given you, what powers, what do you know, what is your knowledge? But take any Sahaja Yogi, I mean, you go to their disciples, find out from Sahaja Yogis, they'll tell you, I was sick with this, I had this sickness, I was so ill, I'm cured, I know. They all know about everything. So one should find out you're paying that person for what? Moreover this payment business is very sinister because you pay for something. Supposing you pay for a play, then it may be the worst of all, I mean, most obnoxious one but you have to go through it because you have paid for it, you see. It's like that. Did you follow this problem? If you, I mean, the payment is the worst thing because then you get sort of committed subconsciously and they think, oh, I've paid it now, how can I waste it by giving it up? Though it's troubling you, it has having problems, this and then these gurus are very clever. There was a lady the other day, she was very sick and she said, I'm following this horrible guru, I told her that this one is a horrible one. So she says, Mother, but you know, my guru says that you have to pay for your karmas. I said, really? You have to pay for your karmas, you have to suffer. So why there is a guru? What is the use of having them in there? Simple question. I mean, if you are suffering, if you have got sickness, if you are not peaceful, then why do you retain a guru? I mean, what is the purpose? In Taiwan now, I think everybody, you know, because of the economical growth, most of the people have a lot of money. So, I think, you know, it's not a problem. Especially, chasmings and you know, different level of education of intellectual groups and I think, after they don't have to worry about their living, then they start to seek or something that will prolong their That's, that's, that's very common, that's very common. But you see, still, though they are seeking, still they think they can pay for it. This is the big problem. If they think they are going to pay for it, then they must get out of it, this point. They cannot pay for it, first of all. Thank You. This is a personal question but it is connected with this. I often wonder how do You do this because everything costs, even You're travelling. I just had a show in Rome, so I know everything costs. How do You, you know, how Me, Me, Yes, Yes. You see, in the beginning it was My husband who was paying out and out for everything but now, of course, these people pay for My travel because they feel little bit embarrassed that Mother should not pay for our realization but formally I used to even pay for their food. There were seven hippies I was working on. So I was even paying for their food and everything, you see, so it started with that and My husband always makes a joke that there are gurus who make money in My house, since the bank is being cleared out. But we are well-to-do people from My father's side also and actually we are from a royal family and we are quite well-to-do people and My husband is quite well-to-do also and he knows that by doing this work, you see, he's earning some punya, some goodies, so he doesn't mind, he doesn't mind. But now, you see, this is, this is now the, everybody feels that this is too much and even My tapes and My audio tapes have been sold and all that but they never gave Me any money out of it, nothing. But now as My husband is retired, they are thinking that it's too much to use Mother for everything. But I don't mind, you see, because after all what is, what is important is Sahaja Yogi, isn't it? My children, everybody is quite satisfied about it. That way I'm lucky. In Your case, I think it's a great example of giving is receiving. Yeah, you see, giving is the greatest receiving, I really tell you. I have sort of a generosity which is sometimes people think to a fault but I enjoy it very much generosity. But what I find that when I'm generous, you see, it opens from one side and the another side's overloading Me. I mean, I don't know what to do. If I give you a small thing as a present, you see, immediately the floods of presence come in, so I don't know how to stop My generosity, so that at least this stops. But I enjoy being generous. There's a Chinese saying exactly that what you're saying, it's called, means, when you turn to the left, you meet the right hill, when you turn to the right, you go to the right route. Nothing goes wrong with it when you give so much. Yeah, you see, He is very enjoyable. I think whole matter is meant for that. Today I was asking Gregor. I said, Gregor, who's given you this? What a nice piece. He said, Mother, you gave me the other piece I asked. He said, you gave me. I said, Oh God! How, Caroline told Me once that you are always giving gifts and things and sometimes there are thousands of people. How do you do that? You see, I just get them, really it's a crush. It's just a, I hit the jackpot everywhere. Really, I tell you, won't believe. I somehow or other get things very clean. Now these, this time I brought these necklaces, you see. They were for a song, I got so many of them. Just got them, I just get it, what to do. When I don't spend so much money as they think it to be. A certain family thing when I give, maybe they are expensive but I don't know what are their prices because we got it free, you see. But other things when I have to buy something for them and now this carves I bought and ties I bought, this one I gave you, what is that? It's a little elephant, little diamonds on the top. She gave thirty of them to all the ladies at once. She passes and she gives hundreds. This is the jackpot again. The other day I hit a jackpot in Florida suddenly. Suddenly you know, just that. What was it? It was in a shop. She has purses upstairs in the bedroom for all of her children. I mean they look like good leather. Yes, and I got these purses for you from London, these are the ones Karan has got it. The one I gave it to all of them and the ties to go. Just I get it, I tell you. These ties where did I find, you know? We were in Rome, Rome and we were staying in a hotel and when I got down there was a gentleman who was selling these ties and I said, what, these are all silk ties? Yes, and Piacarda, can you imagine? And also the scarves, Piacarda and he gave Me for a song, I tell you, won't believe, he gave Me for a song. I bought all of them and I went up. So, my husband started looking, how did you get it? I said, I don't know. There was one gentleman who brought it, he gave it to Me. Interesting, the whole thing. It all works out, if you want to give, you get it, I tell you. You have to believe that there is this Divine power which organizes everything. What happened? She's worrying that I might be using her for a film, she only had one role. With you around maybe we shouldn't worry about lacking more. She's a real surgeon, didn't he? Like, once we had a program in Santa Petrani uh.. in a very, they are supposed to be very posh place for rich Italians or something and it was in the newspaper, it's going to be hail storm, this and he said, Mother, you want to have a program? There's one fellow called Romano, he's a, he has lots of fans all over the world and he is so fond of Sahaja Yoga. He said, but it's all in the open, what will happen? I said, that it was not going to rain at all, not a single problem. He couldn't believe it and Al Ganesh was there, said, so his Mother is saying, it won't rain. He said, how can it be everybody saying that and how can you say that? He said, alright, let's see, let's have the program and there was not even a single cloud and all of them were driving down from Switzerland. They said, Mother, on the way, everywhere there was rain, till we reached this place, you see, everywhere there was rain. So, it just works out. I mean, if your desires are good, why not? Because this Divine power wants it to happen. It helps you, all the time it helps you. Yes? Mother, for twenty years you've spent a lot of time to develop Sahaja Yoga but are you here happy for the way, the way we are and you have a confidence with human society in very near future, where everybody accepts Sahaja Yoga? See, I don't know about happy or unhappiness but I think we could do better. I think we could do better in all these democratic countries because you have freedom and if, that means you have not used the freedom properly. Those who did not have freedom are wiser people. That shows we have not used our freedom properly. Of course, in India I get thousands, no doubt, because this is their heritage, they know about it. But otherwise, Sahaja Yogis say for in New York, I'm very frustrated, especially in New York. But you have confidence in the future though that you think that mankind's future will be progressing, getting better? Of course, of course, it has to. Some nations will take time but some nations, supposing the Russians and all the Eastern Bloc takes over, then in competition at least others will start. So you think the world is headed for a brighter future? Of course it is and otherwise they are in for a shock, one of the two. Because it solves your agricultural problems, your agriculture grows well, it solves your animal's problems, it solves also the ecological problems, ecological problems also. So, I mean, you get into a balance, you see, balance of life, complete. Like you know what to use, the way we are become slaves, we have become slaves of machinery, then we use machinery as much as we want. We are the masters. Machineries are not the masters. And money doesn't take the first place, it's the satisfaction. Whatever gives you joy, that's what you want. Money doesn't give joy. So all priorities change and all the human understandings absolutely get proved to be stupid sometimes. This was stupid. Sahaja Yogi started laughing at it. Moreover in the West is the bigger problem is that we go to extremes in everything, go to extremes. Because we have so-called freedom, we go to extremes, you see. And that's how because mental projection, you see, moves in a linear way and it is not substantiated by reality. So it recoils back on you, say science. With science where everyone is to atomic energy and then atom bombs. Like that it recoils. But science is also in a way good because it tells you this is wrong. It tells you, like through computer you can find out what wrong we are doing. It tells you but we don't take heed of that. We don't take heed of what the science is telling us. Science indicates everything. I mean, if you use science in a wiser way you will find out that this is not proper, this we're going too far with it. Even money, money teaches you all the time. See with money what happens, you take to bad things. With affluence your children are ruined and so many things happen. It teaches you all the time. But we don't want to take heed, you see, that wisdom will happen. But that wisdom comes to Sahaja Yoga, through Sahaja Yoga and then you see it yourself clearly, going too far. Now like somebody wants to, is glued to television. It's wrong because all the time it's such a headache and once in a while is all right if there's a good feeling or something good is there, nourishing, some joyous. But people are glued, I've seen people just sit before the television throughout and it's very dangerous for the brain also. So what happens that when you are a Sahaja Yogi you don't see television, you see it only we have to see. That's all, you get into the balance. Now in London the big problem, the cows are getting mad and those who eat those cows are also getting mad. You must have heard about it. Yes and that is because they were feeding these cows with the dead animals and cows are vegetarians, you must understand they are vegetarians. They don't like meat. Human beings can eat meat but not cows and that's how they got into this problem and now they, human beings have got it, they can't cure them. So a balanced life is the only thing that we need and that is only possible. The balanced life, wise balanced life is only possible if you are a Sahaja Yogi because like you want to first sit on a bicycle, you go like this, you see, then you balance yourself. Then you know how to, then automatically you can do it in the same way. Like in the car we have accelerator and we have got a brake. Now we have to first learn how to use, if you just pressing one thing it doesn't work out. Then you become a driver, you understand what to do. But still you are not the master, master is sitting behind. Then you become the master and when you become the master you see the driver in you and you see the accelerator and also you see the brake and you know how to handle it. Once you are out of it. Best example is I give up the carpet now, supposing this is the carpet is beautiful, thank God doesn't belong to Me because if it belongs to Me it's a headache. I have to ensure it and now this I don't know if it will be spoiled, this will happen, that will happen. But it is somebody else's, then I'm enjoying it better because no headache, it is costly. Secondly, the thing is when I look at it I don't think because I can go into that state of thoughtless awareness. Then I look at it without thought. This is another point. You can get into thoughtless awareness with Sahaja Yoga so that you don't have to think, think, think all the time and worry your head. You can get into a state where it is your thoughtless awareness. Now you watch this thing without thoughts. What happens the joy that was put into it in its creation starts pouring out. It feels so, at the complete joy, like a lake without any river, like a lake without any river, all the creation around it is reflected. You just enjoy everything you enjoy. So many things to be enjoying. That's Zen, that's Zen, that's Zen, I mean that's the Zen part, thoughtless awareness you see. Being a mother of two young children I cannot resist asking uh.. you'll be pleased to talk about children and how uh.. how could we help them? By our example. See, I've never told My children anything about Sahaja Yoga unless suddenly they ask for it but they see Me, you see. Even My husband, I never forced but because of Me in My house there's peace, there's joy, everything and now they are seeing all these things so now they are asking for it, alright. Whenever they ask I'll tell them but it is not to be forced. But if one person is a Sahaja Yogi the whole house becomes, you see, comes into quite a balance. The other day after I seen You uh.. when I got back home My husband asked Me, How do you feel seeing Sri Mataji? I said well she reminds me of Your mother and uh.. his mother, he's come from a Catholic family of children of 12, 12 children and the mother is really loving and giving and just full of uh.. a lot of good quality and I said, I said that that's how I felt, the simplest way to explain it. He said, aha, that's the way you try to get Me into your Sahaja Yoga. Very clever they might think but it's for their benevolence, you see, once they start seeing what, what benevolence it has given you, you see, naturally they automatically come, don't have to tell them, I mean, that much wisdom everybody has, isn't it? I think in New York we'll, we, if we get Chinese it will be nice. I think Chinese, I think, are better in New York. We have, I don't know, we have other communities also, uh.. quite a cosmopolitan places. New York is a very cosmopolitan place but when the people write from their own country like from Spain somebody writes to here to Spanish then they come to Sahaja Yoga but here somehow that even the newspapers were not very happy with us, I don't know why. Shri Mataji, I'm afraid I have to be late. It's been a very intriguing discussion, I must say it. I thank You for Your time and patience. May God bless you. May God bless you. I hope you do something for New York people and they'll thank you all in their lives, you see. It happens, it happens like that. We all try as best we can. Yes, yes, please. Nice to meet you. Thank you, very nice. Nice meeting some very deep person, a journalist because normally what they see, what floor was there, what carpet was there, what it has got, somebody else's house, it's like something. You know, this is something that cannot get to the point, see. May God bless you, I'm very happy. Thank you for coming. And you have to save, save your drug addicts, you see, that's the point they must know. And also Chinese have drug addiction quite a lot here. Thank you very much. Are they ready, the children? Yeah, drug addiction is another point which gets brought. Overnight, overnight people give you drugs, over-dried. You see, Chinese had this problem before also and now she's saying the black people. Black people are terrible, they are men's facials, the males, they are taking drugs. And the women are looking after their children. They'll be destroyed completely. I'd like Mother, last question from Carol. Yeah. You're all mentioning two great philosopher, philosopher in China, Lao Tzu and Campisius. Lao Tzu is more like spontaneous. Campisius is more like mainstream and dominate Chinese society. How is Lao Tzu you say? Almost like a center and spontaneous. Campisius is more aggressive and dominate Chinese society for thousand years, like mainstream. Yeah. Sahaja Yogas can't say. Is both combined, how I'll tell you? It's combined with any money, any conflicts. You see what, Confucius, Confucius was, believed in the horizontal growth, you see. And Lao Tzu believe in the vertical. But we believe in achieving the Spirit which gives you vertical as well as horizontal. But is the actualization of it. See, both of them could not give realization to people, that's the problem. One for the horizontal and another for the vertical. But both growths are done in Sahaja Yogis. We have Sahaja Yogis who some are horizontal, some are vertical. Inside yoga also we have. But we have to tell them, bring the balance. We'll see another thing. That's Confucius. I think we should probably end this now. It's 11.25, you've been talking for an hour and a half. All right, it's all right. But now just tell them we have this point, this is important. She has understood the vertical and the horizontal. Yes. That's how you can explain these two persons very clearly. Lao Tzu and Confucius, absolutely. But your country is that way, gradually has grown into it. I don't know why they have taken to Confucius only not to Lao Tzu. I don't know, the Chinese today. People, they consider Lao Tzu is more like more betrayed because the influence to the society is money cautious and conscious. Lao Tzu don't give them money. Confucius is more aggressive, so more limited with that direction. And here they reach to a certain level, then it's a time they need a Lao Tzu. Yes, that's it. They will come up. But I tell you Chinese government, whatever mistakes they have committed, please forgive them. Because it's just out of too much of, you know, also the students will be too much, I think, you see, because there was no proper proposal as to how get the democracy. You just can't stand up and say, now we have democracies. Just think of it, you see, in a country. So, if that moved with little wisdom and then would have been all right. It was a bit, both sides was a bit, they got angry, this, that and it's a mistake which must be forgiven. It's a mistake out of panic, out of panic. It's a mistake done out of panic, you see, so you must forgive. Could I ask you one extra question? My husband is a psychoanalyst and I told him that, you know, our first condition for meditation it has to be forgiving, forgive yourself, forgive others. He said it's not realistic, he said it should be working out instead of just saying, forgive you. No, no, it's the most realistic thing because you tell him, what do you do when you don't forgive or forgive? You don't do anything, it's a myth. Is that simple as that? Is she followed up? We have to fill the most of the talk later on. Ah, very good. I'll explain to her most of the talk, she can get it, I guess. You are living with a myth, torturing yourself, playing into the wrong hands and doing what others want you to be into. You see, the people who have really harmed you are happy while you are unhappy. You didn't have to be taken. What's that? Chinese jade, I just brought back. Oh, it's so beautiful. Why should you give Me, you see, this Chinese jade? When You talk about Your gathering of things, I have the same experience because I went to the middle part of Taiwan and bought a pink jade for My daughter and it cost almost 10 dollars US dollar and when I got back to Taipei, I walked into a shop of for art supply and paintings and then I walked in there and there was this humble woman who buy beads and do it herself and I got 10 for 10 dollars. So I bought at least 50 or 60 of them and I'm... But this is the... I only got... She only had two of these. Beautiful. The others are more common I'm going to give to your children. Oh, good. I have different colors. Oh, I see. I went to Taiwan where it was the cheapest place in the whole world, you know, and I bought beautiful things from there, beautiful things and I didn't know that you are not supposed to buy things from there. I bought books and everything. At the customs asked Me, what did You buy? I said, I bought the books. I said, what? I can't buy the books here. I said, why? It was not authorized but I bought them. I said, alright. They didn't sell it. Beautiful books they had. I knew it will be one day very rich. Yes, and now they say the Chinese-Americans are very stingy in comparison to what they have. That goes with money, stinginess. But I think, you know, I don't agree with it. It's beautiful isn't it? It looks nice. But actually they say that pink is always a quartz, not a this thing, you see, that quartz. Quarrels? It's a quartz stone. Shri Shri Shri Shri. But I think, uh.. jay has many kinds, they are white. No, but they say so, that the jade is only green and light green but others are quartz. But I have seen maroon color, you see, like that. You have seen, that's a beautiful piece there. In the museum is the cabbage. Yes, yes, yes. In that there's one grasshopper. Yes, it is. Because grasshopper always we use. Oh, you have beautiful things in the museum, I saw that. And also the crack potteries and all that. Beautiful things you have. Beautiful museum. Yes, we look forward to your coming. Yeah, we'll see that. And we are very grateful of your decision of coming also. I'm sure, you know, they are rich and all that but they are very wise people, very wise. They will be much better. Maybe sometimes a bit complicated. Sometimes, sometimes. From our background and cultural and philosophy and things, I find Chinese people are not so good. They read a lot, that's the problem, they read a lot. Chinese people are very conditioned also. They read a lot. They are very conditioned because of reading. I mean, you know, this gentleman who took, I don't have to get you his name, books, you see, so many books, I think three thousand books he took from India to China, three thousand books. I don't know how he must have carried. Shri Mataji, Shri Mataji. Yes, imagine three thousand books. And I saw the place of a great scholar, saw the place where he's put these books so carefully, so beautifully. Upanishadas, Vedas, everything he took there. I don't know how he got three thousand books to be carried there. He actually changed the Chinese literature because he increased the Chinese vocabulary to more than thirty thousand. Really? Just translating the... In these things, yeah. It's a very subtle language also. But he was a master, he was a master, no doubt. All right? So should we go now with this, some other things happening in this? Thank you, thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. I'm sure it will work out, I'm sure. I always said that if you have with the Chinese, you have with the right part. I don't think Jews will ever think of it, no. Your children have not eaten their breakfast because they're all working on the ice. She's had a problem again this morning, so they're still all upstairs. Still the ice are there back here? Yeah, I don't know. Vern is up there now, and I went down and got some Sahaja Yogis to come up and work on her. So they're up in the room. So what you do is to make them take breakfast, bring that down here and work on it. Okay. May we do a interview? Deepan, very stern, thermos potty, deep on earth, great deep antenna, power places. You see, if you would love it. Shri Mataji, for... Go on. Well, this afternoon I have to drive you for security reason. To the U.N. I think we should go now, otherwise we won't be able to do anything. What time you have to go, Pradhan? The function is at five o'clock. So from Queens... Just say it is twenty minutes from Queens. Is that correct? Let me ask Caroline because I never drove it from Queens. Yeah, then... She's the one who called Me. Caroline, from Queens to the U.N. She said it's about thirty minutes, I am. Thirty minutes? Yeah, because of traffic. You are going away from the traffic too. Could be forty-five, could be twenty. Okay. So, say could be forty-five, could be twenty, depends on the traffic. So we, I asked Andrea to tell Babette if we are not there at five to welcome people and stuff. We'll be there at five. We have to be there. Thirty minutes I wish we could. The Shri Mataji, it is very auspicious to have the class people coming to interview you. That's very great. And tomorrow the radio station, that will make a difference. That will make a difference. But first of all we have to be better instrument of the Paramashankanya, Shri Mataji. This is what I have to say. It's not such a fun time. See, what about the instruments that we have used there? What is it? I think we are going to take some, just snack before you go or shall we fix your lunch? No, no, no. I'll not have fruits because of the diarrhea. But what I can have is your popcorn. Popcorn, I'll have some popcorn. Shri Mataji, I think that the news, I was talking to a lot of the TV stage, I think it's different now. I think that there's a chance in the future that we can do more on TV. Channel five might be there tonight, not tonight. Let's see what he does. That might put some ideas. I think there's just more receptivity. Somebody was saying that they read a book against Sathya Sai Baba, somebody has written. He should be contacted and he should come and see Me or something. I was writing about the book. Have you heard about that book? I think there's a hostel. There's also a big book about the Hare Krishnas revealing all the scandal about the Hare Krishnas. They're all being sued in the US, losing all their temples and everything. They're being sued for it all, for fraud. But still there? Very little bit though. This is all very recent. Shri Mataji, in the commercial I have to do for you, I don't see you much so I just must ask, if we use classical paintings in your picture, for the advent maybe, to give the sense of the advent of the new age, if we could use Michelangelo or Rubens or Biola in your picture. I don't think so. Shri Mataji, Dr. Warlicker's telephone is coming out. What's the problem?

What a wonderful evening, most unexpected. These are, most of these are really ragas like Indian and they are of five lobes. We have ragas like Purnakali and all that. Some of the ragas are little elaborate and the way they change is very beautiful. Such young guests, they are playing so well. It is such a pleasure really and see their concentration and playing beautiful things. I'm really very much overwhelmed with joy. Thank you very much. Because we can only keep this room up to ten, so we still have ten minutes left. Lydon, do you want to bajan? Small song, simple song. Because I've talked to the group leader, Mr Wong, he said he'd like to learn something from Indian music. I was just now telling him that we should give them present of Hamza Dalit and sitar players so that they can see for themselves. Because this is the same, if you are about to say. We have too many ragas, these are four, five ragas which they have played very well. But must be I might two thousand five minutes back. This music, yes, see, very enchanted, very enchanted. And I've told them the benefits of playing before you. I've told them the benefits of playing music before you. I hope sometime they could come to India. We'll be presenting you with some nice Indian music on the tapes, you can listen to them. I've asked him to get some Indian music for you to listen on the tapes. We have something not like this, it's called sintur, you see, it's like this. But this is remarkable only with the two strings you play so well. What is it called as? This we have, this is the universal instruments, the flute. What's it? That is bibha. What's it? Bibha. Chong. Beautiful. We too have, see, but with many more strings. And this we have in a different way, santur we call it, this kind. It's different, only you can play with one side. It's very interesting. Nice to see such nice musicians. Are you all going to sing about Me? Mata, o Mata, Mata, o Mata, Mata. You are all going to sing? Yes, we'll sing now. Anyone? Yes. This is a folk song, not a sovagat, but it is a folk song from a village. It's a folk song. It's a folk song. It's a folk song. This is a folk song.

card ib becomes meta I am not a man. I am a man. I am not a man.not a man. I am not a man. I am not a man. I am not a man. I am not a man. I am not a man. I am not a man. I am not a man. I am not a man. I am not a man. I am not a man. I am not a man. I am not a man. I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the very outset I have to tell you that truth is what it is. You cannot change it. You cannot conceptualize it. By reading books or listening to lectures or sermons you cannot find it. By going into austerities also you cannot find it. Because it is all mental activity. You have to go beyond the mind. Now whatever I am going to tell you, you should not take it for granted. Because we have had lots of problems with blind faith. But keep your mind open like a scientist and treat this as a hypothesis. Keep your mind like this. But if it is proved then you have to accept as honest people. Because it is for your own benevolence. And for the benevolence of your country. And for the benevolence of the whole humanity. Is still they are doing it. Now please stop. You can't do it without My permission. I am sorry. I don't mind if they were independent. But they are not. They are under control of the church. So what's the use? So please keep your mind open and listen to Me. So many things have been conditioned into the minds of people that is difficult to tell them that is not the totality. It is not the reality either. You have to know the absolute truth. We do not know the absolute truth. If we had known there would not have been any arguments, any quarrels, any wars. But everybody thinks that they know the truth and that's how they fight. First of all we have to know that unless and until we know the reality we are living in an unreal world. And if you see how far we are going in doing wrong things all over the world it is really shocking. Everything has to happen to human beings so that their awareness becomes absolute. This power about which they have talked is the power which all of you have got. This is all your own. If this instrument is not connected to the mains it has no meaning. In the same way if you are not connected to the mains you have no meaning. Especially our young people are trying to find their identity because they feel lost. I do not blame them because they know that reality is not what we believe into. I don't blame them. First of all let us know that when we try to seek something even science fails. Because science is immoral. Whatever is obvious, whatever is material they can find out about it. About this power the Greeks knew long time back. They called it as sacrum bone. That is the sacred bone. But I think in Greek you all have also forgotten your past. Which was very great and which knew so many things about subtleness of our awareness. Athena means primordial. All sorts of attacks have been there and all morality has been brought down to the level of very low human beings. This cannot answer many questions. It cannot say why are we on this earth. This we should ask them to religions. And their religions also fail because they have now become money oriented or power oriented. They are all fighting among themselves. Let us take the sake of Christ. Christ was a very great incarnation. He was above human understanding. He did not know what sort of people he was to face in this world. And the religion he has given is very great but cannot be followed by normal people. Myself I was born in a Christian family. And I saw the Christians, Christianity and Christ absolutely separate. The reason was, I'll tell you that on the fifth chapter of Matthew's if you read, Christ has said that anybody does a sin out of one eye should take it out. If you do sin with another eye also take it out. If you do sin with your right hand take it out. Or if you do sin with your left hand also cut it out. If somebody slaps you on one side of the face turn the other cheek to him. I have moved in so many Christian nations I haven't seen one who is even without one eye. They just go to church finished. And Mohammed Sahab was even worse than him. He was also a very great incarnation. He thought that Christ was very strict with men why not with women also. So he said that if any woman looks at another man apart from her husband she should be buried half way and should be stoned to death. With this application of rule I saw America most of the women would be in the Mother Earth buried and stoned. I mean I just thought that look at these ordinary normal human beings. This religion can be only followed by superhuman beings or you can call it by angels not by normal people. Specially in modern times it's impossible. Also the Sharia that was given to Jews by Moses was taken over by Mohammed Sahab because Jews wouldn't care for it. Throughout none of them have said that this is a separate religion, Christianity is a separate religion, Jews another religion or Islam another religion. In the Koran Moses is described, Abraham is described, Christ is described, even the Mother of Christ is described. And the respect of Mother of Christ is shown so clearly in Koran. Not in the Bible, in the Bible she is called as a woman. No respect of the women is responsible for the decline of women in the West. So women had to all the time please men, they have to wear dresses like prostitutes to please men. Paul was a hater, he was a great hater of women. And he edited Bible, showing no respect for the Goddess that was the Mother of Christ. And she became of course Madonna by the public who were following actually the pagan religion. On the cross says, Behold the Mother. This is the fact we should know. But according to the Greek, we can say mythology as they call it, Athena was the primordial Mother. But all these ideas were cut out completely. Only in India they know she was the primordial Mother. In our Sanskrit books she is described very clearly. It is called that in the island of Manipur is this one, which is the Greece. Greece is this center, the navel as you have in Delphi. Still despite all effort to eradicate all your mythologies, still the truth remains. When I first came to Greece I was really shocked that the people have completely forgotten about their mythology. While we Indians know a lot about Greece, but when I told them they were surprised how could they forget? So I am talking about the primordial Mother. For example, there is the God Almighty, the Father, the Son and there is no Mother, the Holy Ghost. It doesn't make any sense, but people accept blindly. Now you have here in the triangular bone this power of Kundalini, which you can also see in the statues of Athena. This is the snake, which was the one which tried to tell Eve that you must find out the knowledge. Actually God Almighty wanted to create this universe and make human beings better animals, that's all. Perhaps He knew that how men would behave or women would behave if they have given freedom to know the knowledge. But the primordial Mother didn't want. She said, let My children know the knowledge. So She came and told, know the fruit of the knowledge, eat the fruit of the knowledge. When they got the idea about knowledge, they became conscious of themselves. If She had not come up to tell Adam and Eve, we all would have been ordinary animals, better than others. But then we got our freedom to choose whether you want to become a person with knowledge or not. Knowledge which is absolute. But we got lost in our freedom. Especially in the West people seek things which are destructive to them. Thus they lost their wisdom. And in this way we are now in a very problematic world. But there is a way to come out of it. A very simple way. Sahaja means with, ja means born. Born with you is the right to get your Self-Realization. In this country of yours which has such a heritage, the sensitivity to spirituality is not so great. Surprising in Russia, Leningrad which is so close, we get people who are very sensitive to truth. Whatever one may say about Russian government and politics, but the pressure of the people has thrown away all the false gurus, all the false masters. And I am the only one accepted by the government. It happens in a country which was communist. Because they are not so materialistic as people in the democratic country are. Whatever it is, I depend on your heritage in this country and I expect that gradually you people will realize that if the whole world is getting awakened Greeks are not going to be missed out. Why not sit here madam? Hello? Please give her a seat. I mean you are younger people. Give her a seat. See the wisdom. Madam, you sit on this. Please be seated. Yes, I request you to sit down. Be comfortable. You have still people of this kind. This time actually the people here, Sahaja Yogis told Me, better not come Mother here. People have no sensitivity. Last time I had double number of people and only one person came to grow. Now of course America is also something like this. And your Mother, I have to tell you the truth. And the truth is that Americans are stupid people. They are not matured at all. They are like children. You are such an ancient country. They are only two hundred year old. I cannot compare you with them. So it's important to understand what is your background, how traditional you have been. And you have the right to get your Self-realization much more than anybody else. In short I'll tell you what happens once you get your Self-realization. Firstly when this Kundalini rises, She passes through six centers. That means the seventh center which is the first center otherwise you can call it, is not involved in the ascent of the Kundalini that way. So this center which is responsible for all our excretion, including sex, has nothing to do with your ascent. About twenty-five years back I had told Americans that Freud is a fraud. But they didn't like Me. And this now after so many years there are books coming out, Freudian Freud, Downfall of Freudian Empire. This Freud has made human beings so degraded that they are nothing but sex points. His idea about the Mother's love was so absurd. If he had come to India I tell you they would have all cut him into pieces. There's nothing holy in his mind, nothing auspicious in his mind. These six centers are our foundations and they look after our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being. Now this Kundalini is the reflection of the Primordial Mother, of the Holy Ghost or of the Adi Shakti as they call it. Or Athena. And when She rises She enlightens those centers. As a result all our physical, mental and emotional problems are solved. It's a fact that many incurable diseases have been cured through Sahaja Yoga. As the Kundalini rises the diseases disappear. Mentally you become absolutely peaceful and you see the whole world as a witness. We are all the time jumping on the cusp of the thoughts which come from past and future. But when Kundalini rises it elongates these thoughts and we stand in the present. We have no thoughts at that time but we are fully aware. This is the first stage we call as thoughtless awareness. That's the time we become the witness of the drama. We stop worrying. I may be the oldest person here, I am seventy-two years of age and I am travelling every day. I don't have to go to beautician or anybody to take out my wrinkles or anything. So what happens really is this that this fontanel bone area opens out and the Kundalini pierces through and becomes one with this all-pervading power of Divine love. This is actualization of baptism. It's not some priest who puts some water here and says you are baptized. It's actualization. Your attention becomes extremely concentrated. Actually your innocence shines in your attention. As Christ has said, thou shalt not have adulterous eyes. That happens to you. Actually your eyes become like that and you get a glint of light in your eyes. You can see obviously. All this happens is nothing compared to what actually you gain. Because your attention itself becomes powerful and can act. You can give realizations to others. You can cure people. Because who is the other? You can feel your centers on your finger tips. You can feel the truth on your finger tips. Supposing there is somebody who is a cheat, how will you find out? Somebody who is a false person, how will you find out? After realization you just put your hand and ask the question, is this person real? If he is real then you start feeling a cool breeze in your hand. If he is not then you might start feeling the burning on your finger tips. You become your own master, your own guide because of the Spirit, it's light. It's not only that you can cure yourself but you can cure many others of every type of problems. With this thoughtless awareness you achieve your peace within yourself. You really become peaceful by forming great organizations of peace and peace awards and all that. Nothing is going to work out. I have met many people who are supposed to be great award winners on peace. But they are so hot tempered that if you have to go near them you have to use a barge pole. How can they create peace? Then another thing is no austerities are needed. According to Christ you have to take out your eyes, cut your hand. It is too much. There's no need to do anything like that. You don't have to go to Himalayas or stand on your heads. I just felt that impossible that people will get their realization with all these austerities. On the contrary they'll be finished. If they get their realization and if they become realized souls they don't have to do anything. They become righteous. They become people of great power which is divine. They become like saints. They have no temptations of bad things. They don't destroy themselves and they construct others. So the blindness has to go away. That's very important. So you get your peace. You get the truth. Above all you jump into the ocean of joy. The word is not singular like happiness and unhappiness. These are the two sides of one coin happiness or unhappiness. If your ego is pampered you feel happy. When it is punctured you feel unhappy. So this joy is a state in which we enjoy everything that is beautiful, that is good. I have never seen quarrels between Sahaja Yogis, never. Now Sahaja Yoga is working in sixty five nations in a very big way and we have at least twenty centers in every country and thousands of Sahaja Yogis. In one place called Taliyati in Russia we have twenty one practicing Sahaja Yogis. We are not fundamentalist. One side is fundamentalism and another side is absolute abandonment. Both are wrong. You have to be in the center. But it's not possible by giving a lecture. Only the way it happens when you become one with this all pervading power. So the truth is that you are not this body, this mind, these emotions, this intellect, ego or your conditionings but you are the pure spirit. Second truth is that there is an all pervading power of divine love which is the power of the Holy Ghost. And this is the power which is subtle and does all the living work. You see these beautiful flowers? We take them for granted. Is it not a miracle? If you ask the doctors who runs your heart they will say it's an autonomous nervous system. Who is this auto? That they cannot answer. So the answer is the spirit which has to come into your attention and enlighten you. That is you have to feel the truth on your central nervous system. This is the knowledge. The Gnostics had it. Gna in Sanskrit means knowledge. But they were tortured and were finished completely. So Thomas somehow ran away hiding himself and in his treatise he has described this experience. Now you have to know all about it. Becoming is the point not just knowing mentally. But I would request you not to just finish off everything after you get Realization here. It's just the beginning. It's very sad. You have Nicholas here and he is a saint absolutely. And he has been to so many false gurus, he has seen everything and then he came to Sahaja Yoga. He is very learned. But he is young. At this young age if he is that good we should listen to him. Because somebody is young you can't discuss. So I hope next time all of you who are here will definitely come for the progress of your Realization to grow into it. I am surprised I am a foreigner, I am not Greek. But so many come to listen to me. But later on I don't know what happens to them. They trust Me a foreigner, why can't they trust the Greeks? Because you will be masters. You yourself can do so much for this country. In our Shastras, in our scriptures, Greece is described as Deblo, is the nation of gods. And Alexander also got transformed when he came to India. I was surprised how Indians were so different. So we have to revive ourselves and get back to our own old reputation that we were. Of course you don't have to pay for it. God doesn't understand money or banking. Really it is the human headache. So you don't have to pay for it at all. I hope after Realization tonight you people will be respected. Because it is not now an individual work, it is a collective work. We all have to become collective and understand that we are part and parcel of the whole. The macrocosm becomes the macrocosm. A drop becomes the ocean. And we become really universal, global personality. I know there are some people who have questions in their heads. I have been working for the last twenty five years and I can answer all the questions. Because now I have become very clever. But it is a mental acrobat. What is important is to get Realization, this experience of the Divine. I am sorry I had to tell these television people because they were going to go to the Greek Orthodox Church. Only the saints can judge Sahaja Yoga. I am surprised that the patriarch of Leningrad, of the white order invited Me to Russia and he believes that Sahaja Yoga is the only saving point. It can save the morality and also the nations after nations. But you have to understand first of all what is for your benevolence, for your good. I hope all of you who are here will get your Self Realization. But then you have to promise in your heart that you will grow in Sahaja Yoga. You will not just waste it. It is like the parable of Christ that many seeds got sprouted but got lost in the marsh. Thank you very much. You will hardly take more than ten minutes to get your Self Realization. But again I respect your freedom. If you don't want to have it you should leave the hall. It will not by any chance harm it. But it cannot be forced I am sorry to say. So all those who want to have Self Realization should stay back. I see in the name of Athena.

1992-0909 Public Program United Nations USA DP-RAW

You have been associated for a very long time with the United Nations as the wife of Sir Siphi Srivastava who has been the long-standing Secretary General of the International Maritime Organization in London. So from that side we know the United Nations. However, it is to the different angle that we have invited you here today and this is because you have devoted your entire life to sharing and providing access to seekers, providing access to experiences of the organization and this is what this program today is about is so that indeed the second birth becomes something else than an evangelical reference of the team of lecturers so that it becomes a happening. We felt that staff members of the UN have a right to be informed of this very great happening which is the actualization of our potential to enter into a new state of awareness, much announced, much lost about the consequences of the UN and not the consequently experience so far. I hasten to be making this from outside and I believe that we do not have a very long period of time. This is more or less a lunch pause here. I wouldn't like to talk any longer. If there are some people who came from the first call for the UN I would like them to, I would suggest that they sit in the first row because that would be a brief exchange. At the end of the program Shri Mataji does not have very much time. She flies off New York this afternoon. Thank you very much Shri Mataji for addressing this meeting. There are no press people out here? I bow to all the seekers of truth. At the very outset we have to know that truth is what it is. We cannot change it. We cannot describe it. Also unfortunately at this human level we cannot feel it. So one has to be little humble about it that so far we have not known the truth, the absolute truth. In all religions it is described that you have to have your second birth. Means you have to have your selfhood, that you have to have self-knowledge. Every religion has talked about it. Despite that the religions have not been Spirit oriented. They are either power oriented or money oriented. Any amount of science cannot give you your assent and any amount of reading cannot do that. You have to become. All kinds of things people have done in the search of truth. I mean there have been so many seekers in these modern times. William Blake has said it clearly that the men of God will be born and they will seek the truth and they will make others divine. That's the time today has come. But one must understand that it is our evolutionary process by which you actualize the experience of your Spirit. It's the actualization. It is not talking about it. The truth is that you are not this body, mind, these conditionings, egos and you enjoy but you are the pure Spirit. Unless and until you find the pure Spirit you can never be satisfied. You may be identified with any organization, with any kind of a cult or any kind of an idea. That is not going to give you satisfaction, it's just an ego satisfaction. What you have to get to know is yourself by which a real benevolence is achieved. And for that a mechanism is placed within us already. For living process we don't pay anything, we see here flowers. How much did we pay to Mother Earth or to this bush of flowers? Nothing. So you can't pay for it. That's one thing we should understand. You can't pay for your evolution. Secondly we have become human beings and that we have achieved this without doing much effort about it. So it is effortless to stand on your head or to read books or to think that we are all going to achieve it after our death is not true. So many things have come, like yarn from the heads of some people and people just follow as if they have no personality, they have no understanding. Have we found the solution? Even is there I know, my husband has been working for United Nations for sixteen years, then he resigned ultimately. But despite all that one has to know has you even achieved its goal? No. What is the reason for all these problems from where does this basis of problems come in? Human beings are responsible for most of the human problems, not the Divine. And these problems come to us from our own being, our own centers which are subtle centers within us. When these center go into jeopardy, we get into troubles, physical, mental, emotional. But when these centers are put right, you are all right. I am very happy to tell you that we have three doctors in India who have got their MD in curing some very incurable diseases. And there are seven doctors in England who are now recording how many people have been cured through Sahaja Yoga. Without it you cannot get rid of your physical, mental and emotional problems because your centers are out of gear, they are undernourished, dislocated and have no connection with the whole. These centers are to be enlightened. But we are so much used to bombastic advertisement and all kinds of marketing that we take to such things much more. I mean somebody comes up dressed up in say orange dress, we very much impressed. Some of them might be coming directly from jails. Superficially if you start looking at it, there's a market even for seekers and so many are lost. I'm sorry to say so many are lost because they do not seek their benevolence. They should find out, what did we find out? You should find out from the disciples what did they find out. It is a inner built-in system already there existing within you which gives you this experience of the Spirit. Because you are the pure Spirit. You are not this body, this mind, these conditionings, ego as I told you, but you are the pure Spirit. And there is an all-pervading power which is named by different names like Islam calls it Ru. In India they call it Param Chaitanya. In the Bible it is called as all-pervading power of God's love or you can say is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. You have never felt it before that it existed. It does exist. Who does all these living works? Who did our evolution? Who gave us this brain? We take it for granted. And this kind of attitude towards ourselves is very detrimental to our spiritual growth. The most important thing is to understand that all these problems come to us from within. Genetic problems, they also are there. Of course genetically we are different, maybe we can say we have races, all right, agreed. But who is the superior race? Who belongs to the superior race? Those who are aggressive, those who kill people, those who indulge into all kinds of nonsensical things, stupid idiotic people, are they of a superior level or those who keep themselves pure, who keep themselves simple, who are full of compassion, the saints? But I have to tell you one thing, that whatever you might have done, whatever wrongs you might have done so-called, but divinity within you is absolutely intact. You might have followed any false guru, you might have followed any false things, you might have done something which is not righteous, but divinity cannot be touched because it is eternal. It's like some clouds have covered the sun, it is there. Only it has to manifest. And to manifest it there is an instrument within you. This knowledge is not modern, it's very ancient knowledge. And if it comes say from an India, especially from a lady, one should not doubt it. We have had lots of knowledge from the West about science and much more from men, so it doesn't matter if a lady can tell you something. But one has to understand that we have overgrown outside, we are ex-troughts. There must be some development within, so this is the knowledge of our roots. I don't say you should accept Me blindfolded at all, because you are free to ascend or go to hell. Nobody can stop. This freedom has been given to you, so nobody can stop it. You can ruin yourself, you can destroy yourself, do what you like with yourself. But there is a path by which you can absolutely enter into the kingdom of God. Now see the problems that we have. The first thing that happens to you when Self-realization takes place. It happens because there is a power within us in the triangular bone called sacrum kundalini. It's called kundal. Kundal means coils, because it is coiled up in three and a half coils. This power is there. You can see in some people pulsating when it rises. And when it pierces through your fontanel bone area, then it gets connected to this all-pervading power. It's not just putting hand on your fontanel, I should say, now you are baptized. No. It's an actualization. If you say you are a Self-realized person, you are a twice born, it's not just a certificate, I am twice born. Supposing tomorrow I put a level on Me that I am a member of you and I am not, because I have no powers. If you are a twice born person, you have to have some powers. If you are a spiritual person, you have to have some spiritual powers, otherwise you are not. So, as a result of this happening, first of all, as I told you, when this kundalini passes through your different centers, it nourishes it. These are actually seven centers, but the kundalini passes through six centers. These centers are made of left and right side, sympathetic nervous system, the parasympathetic in the center, and this is the center about which I am talking. This is the central path which Buddha has described. So this power, this is the residual power which rises, passes through these centers. Last time I did tell you about what are the problems of bureaucrats, and if you want I can repeat them again a little bit. My husband has been a bureaucrat all his life, and I have been always in contact with so many bureaucrats all my life, I mean that's my another life. Their main problem is they think too much. And thinking too much causes a very big problem. For one center you don't have that thing. Here, if you see the second center, the yellow one, which looks after our liver, our pancreas, spleen, kidneys and the lower part of intestines. So it has a very important function to convert the fat cells for the use of the brain. This is much more important. So when you think too much, all the time this conversion goes on, and the other subsidiary jobs, you can call them, like looking after your liver and all these things, is neglected. So physically first thing that happens is your liver goes out. With the liver it has a job of converting all poison into heat and emitting it out, but it cannot, it doesn't function. So the heat is accumulated, with this heat you get hot-tempered, nervous. Then heat rises upward. When it rises upward there's another center, we call it right heart. This, if it is caught up into that heat, gives you asthma. Supposing that heat doesn't rise higher and move sideways, then it attacks your pancreas, you get diabetes. Only, mostly the bureaucrats get diabetes, surprisingly. Supposing in a village you go in India, they take at least three to four spoons of sugar every day, the villagers. They never get diabetes, they don't know what that disease is. The reason is they don't know. They lead a very simple life, sleep well, enjoy themselves. Then after that is even more dangerous thing, is the spleen. The spleen becomes extremely hectic with people who are doing such important works. You have to be in time, you have to be slave of your watch all the time. Then the bosses are there, the newspaper, everything, quite shocking. I mean you have to have sensationalization. Newspaper is not here today, I'm not surprised, because there's no sensation in getting self-realization. So that sensationalization acts on our mind and as a result we become hectic. And when we become hectic, this poor spleen doesn't know how to carry on producing red blood corpuscles for the use of emergencies. So the attack comes and what you get is blood cancer. You'll be happy to know that blood cancer has been completely cured by Sahaja Yoga, completely, without changing any blood or anything, of many people. Three of them were architects, one of them was a bureaucrat. After that this heat can reach your kidneys and that's how you stop your kidney functioning. You have to take dialysis as a certificate for you to spend money and die. Doctors will never tell you that dialysis doesn't help, it doesn't cure. They want to give you hope. And then lastly what you get is the constriction of your intestine and you get constipated and all the problems of the constipation. All these things happen to you because of one center. So imagine there are all these seven centers which are to be put right and unless and until we do something about it we are in for trouble, not only physically, also mentally, also spiritually, because there are many gurus and many things in the market. Just, I don't know, they mesmerize and do what they like. They achieve nothing. They talk of something that the world is going to collapse or something we must do for peace. What can they do for peace? So many people have got peace awards but if you meet them privately you'll have to use a barge pool. So hot tempered I tell you. Impossible if there's no peace within. How can you give peace to anybody? Now where is this peace? It's not outside, it's within yourself. With realization you are on the periphery, outside of a wheel. You jump onto your axis. Axis is silent and you start watching all your activity like a witness, become absolutely peaceful and you watch it and you witness it. This witnessing state has been described in so many scriptures but nobody thinks that if we have to be spiritual we have to develop that witnessing state. Firstly when Sahaja Yoga arises above this center which is on the optic chiasma you become thoughtlessly aware. In Sanskrit called Nirvichar Samadhi. Thoughtlessly but aware. You are absolutely aware. We are all the time jumping on the cusp of the future or the past thoughts. But by this you establish yourself in the present and in the present there is no thought. There where you go, grow spiritually. All religions have told about this in this way or that way but if the whole direction of this religion is towards power and towards money, how can you reach that state? It's not talking big or describing something great or sermonizing but it is something that has to happen within ourselves. You have to become something. Even in Koran Mohammed Sahib has said at the time of kiyama your hands will speak and this is exactly what happens in Sahaja Yoga that you can feel your centers on your fingertips. Everyone has talked about it but we are not looking at it. I was surprised I was in Russia and thousands, thousands came to Sahaja Yoga and got it and so deeply. Communism has done some good to them I must say. Definitely this kind of freedom to choose to abandon all value system has been of no help to us. I don't know what to say about their government but the people are so beautiful and they shun all other nonsense. They are so sensitive to spirituality. I mean this hall would not even fit in for a small village there, you will be surprised. I had to always arrange big, big stadiums. Thank God they have lots of stadium in every place. But if you come to so-called democratic countries, I don't know what has happened to them. Maybe I don't know, maybe the media, maybe the so-called freedom that we have, we have misused, maybe our attention has lost that capacity to feel the divinity. It shifts so fast, people are so shifty. One has to respect oneself as a human being because there is divinity within you. Animals don't have that. There is divinity within you and unless and until you get your Divine manifesting, how are you going to know what you are? You are fantastic, I tell you, you are fantastic. But first you are to be connected to that All Pervading Power. Without connection this has no meaning. In the same way you have no meaning till you are connected. I read one book recently, The Limits of Science, and there he asked three questions which science cannot answer. How are we here? What are we going to do? Here for, what are we going to do? All these three questions can be answered in Sahaja Yoga after Self Realization. It is surprising that in the West there are so many seekers but they don't understand what they are seeking just by proclaiming something like, we are this and we are that. They have achieved nothing. You cannot achieve anything just by saying we are this and we are that. So something has to happen. Now this transformation takes place in no time. It's that key and everybody can get this transformation that you have to get yourself. In short I'll try now to describe you the nature of science and the nature of the Spirit. Science is not conclusive. It doesn't give you absolute truth. It goes on changing from this to that. If we had known absolute truth there would have been no quarrel, no fight. Everybody says the same thing. But we don't know the absolute truth. That's why we have theories, we have so many cults, so many ideas, so many I can say dogmas, all kinds of things. But if we know the absolute truth how can we quarrel then we know the absolute. We know that. All of us will know the same because Spirit is a universal being. United Nations is established to create universality in human being. But unless and until they get Self-realization they cannot. After getting Self-realization only they will realize that you are a universal being. These races, these countries and these various things which separate man from man are artificial, are mythical. Basically you are a universal being. So the first thing you realize you are a universal being so that you can of course feel your own centers on your fingertips and also you can feel the centers of others on your fingertips. It actually happens to you. And when you feel these centers if you know how to correct yours and the correct of others, problem is solved. Then you don't have to worry about illness. This is a mother's style of putting some chocolate on top. Somehow it should go into your sharp intelligence that we have to still achieve the for which we are born. But we have to respect ourselves. That's the main point I think is missing, that we don't respect ourselves as human beings, that there's a little breakthrough now more left to us. Then the second very important thing about the nature of Spirit is that you become absolutely peaceful, absolutely dynamic in the, at the same time you are extremely compassionate, extremely compassionate. And just your concern is not only for yourself, for your own problems, but for the whole world. I'll give you a very simple example. I went to Russia and the people who arrived by the first flight were twenty-five Germans, young German surgeons. And I asked them, I said, how are you here, here? So they said, Mother, is it not our responsibility to be here? I said, no, not yours, your forefathers. They said, but we are responsible also for our forefathers, that's why we are here. And there are tears in their eyes. And the way they helped these Russians, I tell you, day and night the way they worked on them, it was really remarkable. So the compassion becomes so pure that you don't expect anything, you just want to really give love, a pure love to everyone. And then you establish yourself into universal religion. That means you respect all the religions, all the essences of religions, and you see the relationship that exists between them, which is very strong. And you find that all these religions were born on the same tree of spirituality, only we have plucked them, we are fighting with these dead flowers. These dead flowers, this is My religion, this is My religion, this is My religion. So you have fundamentalism. When you become a universal personality, your religion is universal, which encompasses all the religions, which many people don't like. I was surprised that Dalai Lama said, we don't want to have a universal religion because we are different people. How are we different? I would like to know. We smile the same way, laugh the same way, cry the same way. We have the same feelings. How are we different? Because we have different hair or different skin. After we, we should not be like robots or regimented. We have to be different. That's the variety which makes life so interesting and beautiful. Because we are different to look at, you just open your skin and find everybody has the same nerve, the same muscle, everything there intact, just the same. It's such a skin-deep difference. We just vanish it into thin air. We have very good seminars in India sometimes, we get three thousand people from fifty-five countries. I have never seen them quarrelling with each other, never, never fighting, such love. Of course they pull each other's legs all right, just lot of humour, that's all. But such fun, such enjoyment, we are missing it all. Why? Without Self-realization you cannot work out United Nations, I can tell you that. Because the attention is more on other things than your spirit which has promoted this idea of United Nations. We have to be at the level of our spirit to understand the essence of United Nations. It's not bureaucracy, it's not any nation, it's not any race, but it's ourselves who has to achieve it. It's for our benevolence we have to achieve it. It is My privilege to come and talk to you because I feel sometimes very close. I have been here many a times before also and to celebrate so many of your functions I have been with My husband here. But that's a different line. This is a much more important subject which has substance in it. By the time you leave United Nations you shouldn't feel, what did we get? What you have to get is this universal nature of your spirit. That has to be achieved through Self-realization. I think the employees of UN have to take to it. But I was surprised that they are more attached to things which are more showmanships and people are doing all kinds of marketing. It cannot be marketing, one thing one should understand. It cannot be some showmanship. It's something genuine. How can you live with something which is not genuine? Moreover it is so relaxing because everything now is worked out through the Divine power which looks after you, which manages everything. All your problems are solved, even material problems are solved. That's why they say the blessings. Now in England you must be knowing that the unemployment is the highest. But not a single Sahaja Yogi is there who has not got employment. Everyone who has come to Sahaja Yoga has prospered. Because your attention becomes so alert, because you become so wise, you become brilliant. Of course, my husband was a very, very brilliant man, no doubt. He got this job because of brilliance, very capable, everything. But he says, now I have the peace of mind. Now he is a Sahaja Yogi. If you have this at the time when you are working, you'll be surprised you'll become really dynamic. And the amount of blessings you'll have every moment, you will feel the blessings coming round. Of course every evening you have to just meditate for ten minutes, that's all. Just ten minutes you have to give to yourself, just to see that this connection is all right. Because in the beginning it dwindles a little bit, it comes up, goes down, you have to fix it. And just to check if this connection is all right or not, ten minutes you have to meditate. Moreover, it is a collective happening that a microcosm has become the macrocosm, that you have become part and parcel of the whole. As it said, kakbar, is the great body of the Divine, you have become part and parcel of that. And supposing a nail is cut out, it will not grow. So you have to belong to that body. Of course you don't have to pay for it, again I must tell you. There are some organization who will just have introductory lecture and then will be money making lectures. It's not like that in such a way. Of course, I mean supposing you have to arrange some hall or something, you have to pay for that, that's all right. But not for your evolution, not for your self-knowledge and for all the subtle knowledge of this subtle instrument within you. And this instrument is meticulous. It is not like one theory of avagado challenged by another and then Einstein's theory challenged. No, you cannot challenge it, it's absolute. It's so efficient, it's absolute. It doesn't fail. It is metascience, you can call it, it is metamodern. It is so fantastic but we can't believe that we are fantastic. We have no faith in ourselves. This is our biggest problem. What I have to tell you that this world is not going to be ruined. There are many organizations these days afloat saying that you better release some money from your purse, otherwise this world will be really destroyed. Such absurd things I don't know how we accept. How can money save this world? God doesn't understand money, He doesn't understand banking, does He? So for intelligent people it is very easy to understand that a time has come for us to achieve that selfhood. Luckily you have a very good center here also, though those who are running it are very disappointed because they say people are not responsible. I'm surprised. I can't believe that in United Nations we don't have seekers of truth. I can't believe that. So many things you achieve which I cannot describe in this short lecture. But one thing I can tell you that you just jump in the ocean of joy. This joy cannot be described because it is so singular, absolute. It's to be experienced. Whatever may be your age, whatever may be your race, whatever you may be, you just enjoy human beings. You don't have to leave your society, you don't have to divorce, you don't have to give up your families, you don't have to go to Himalayas and stand on your head, nothing of the kind. It's already there, you have done all this in your last lives. This life you just get the reward of what you have done. It's very simple, all of you can get it. After all you are serving your nations and serving United Nations and it's a very blissful thing you are doing and why not you get it? I know these days there are some other problems which you are facing. But if you build up your spiritual forces, all these problems can be solved very easily. Because above all is the power of Divine love which we have never used. We have only used the power of hatred and you just try to use that power, you'll be amazed how powerful you are. You can give realization to others, you can cure people, you can cure yourself, you can know about everything about this subtle Divine knowledge. Now then you read Bible, then you read Koran, then you read Gita, you will know between the lines what is written. I've been so much associated with United Nations and always I felt tremendous love for all the people who are working with it. But it sometimes is difficult to convey. Christ has said, meek in the heart will inherit the earth. That meekness should be there, that's all, that we have to have it. May God bless you all. I'm sorry I have to go to some other place and if somebody has some questions I would like to answer because there's little time I could devote to that. I think that India has been cured and the Keshe which I heard where AIDS has been cured. Now if that is true then I think our willingness is letting the world down by not preventing millions of people dying from AIDS from the world. Sir, I would like to tell you in this America if we try curing people we'll all end up in jail. That's the law, you don't know. They come to India to get you. You cannot do it. Law is in favor of doctors and if I try anything here I assure you we'll end up in jail even if you are from the UN. It's a very funny law, I know that but it is. These diseases are all over the world. Yes, then it's all right. Then we have places where you can come and you can live. But there's one thing I would tell you. We are not here for curing people only. Otherwise thousands will be coming on our end. We are here to make you doctors. So you become the doctor and if you're you can try, you can. It's a fact. Why should I tell you this? Most of you it's a fact. You can live alone anyway. You need not be a doctor. They are very simple people. I'll tell you the reason because we are dealing with the fundamentals of which we are dealing. Suppose you have to treat a thing. You start looking after the leaves or the branches or the bark. You can't. You have to go to the roads. If you know how to reach the boots you can go. You do. Also parades I must say. I'm not afraid to say that. We have. We are very funny people you know. They don't want to live first of all and they don't give up their bad habits. Such a state we are in that you cannot tell them that homosexuality has brought us probability. You cannot. You understand that? So now if you want you try it. You can prove it if I have said something wrong. It's not a challenge but it's an offer. A very humble offer. So many are dying but they will not come to search. Why don't you all become doctors yourself and do it? You can. Who want to do that? Let's see. Put up your hands. What about you sir who asked the question? You should do it. I am very sorry. I'm still unconvinced. I'm only suggesting that you will be doing the greatest. I am. Not named. I mean. I have millions of people who are dying of these diseases all over the world. But I tell you. Don't blame America. I don't know. I'm not blaming America. I'm just saying the law is bad here. That's all. I'm not blaming America for that. I'm not blaming anywhere. I'm not blaming it. But what I'm trying to say that it can be done when people. Now as you said there are thousands. So you need at least one thousand to do it. How can they all approach Me? So I want you to get this power. It's in you. To get this knowledge within one month's time you can do it. It's a fact. It is fantastic. Now as you know My name. At least you can trust My husband. You can ask him. I have cured. That will be clear. But I'm alone. I'm travelling every day going from places to places greeting doctors. You don't have to go to any medical college. The question was from a medical doctor Shri Mataji. Can we. I'm very distinguished one. You should meet and we have a doctor here. Who has done a research? On Dr. Chunk or Pyeong? He's done a research on asthma. Please. If you doctors open your mind a little bit you can help thousands. I'm so happy to know because I myself have done medicine. But I found that medicine also is very sometimes conditions us. There's something beyond. There's somebody asking a question. I have a question about person that is experiencing a bulging disc and spondylitis. Is that going to be a problem to do medication and basically I could get it. Spondylitis. Spondylitis and bulging disc. When a person starts to make play. Is absolutely curable spondylitis. When you feel guilty you get it. Alright. Are you a Catholic? Then you will get it. I am Sahaja. Now you are Sahaja. So you get rid of it. I'm sorry perhaps you can just take one or two more questions and then if Shri Mataji, I don't know Shri Mataji, would you like to end with a meditation or then you have time? May not because I have to go now. But what I'm saying it is should be left open with that. Yes. You should please take it seriously. And you should join, meet these people and learn it. And if you can prove I'm wrong I will be very likely to accept that. But it's not so because I know what you are. I can see much more than you can see yourself in the mirror. And that's why I'm saying the divinity is there. I'm very happy. But do you think WHO will ever listen to Me? Doctor? Straight forward question. Though I knew the, you Secretary General, I have met him, I know him very well. But never opened My mouth to him. So conditioning. They can't see beyond medicine anything. I'm very happy you have such a compassionate view of the whole thing. If you have I'm sure you can work it out. Who else? In Somalia people are telling me that these people are starving and paying for their past lives. And then in scriptures it says the last shall be first. You see these children dropping like flies. What's to be done about these people? You don't give them food, you give them nutrition. So much hypocrisy. Especially the medical profession. Shri Mataji, I'll just try to summarize. This is in Somalia just now. There are millions of people starving and children dying and so on. And just to give them something to eat is hypocrisy. What can we do about it? That's the question. I agree with you. It is not hypocrisy I would say to that extent but that doesn't solve the problem. The question is are such people born in those places paying their past karmas? Why do they go to that? Now we shouldn't say like that. It's being very harsh to say they are paying for the karmas of all of us I should say. Because you have such disparities, you have such wrong ideas. It's a collective. But whatever it is. How do you solve your food problem? Now if I tell you you won't believe? If you have vibrated water you can grow ten times more what you are growing today. Ecological problems can be solved also. We have experimented. But who listens to us? It's a thing little beyond our mind. If you can just jump into that state you can see it very clearly. Ecological problem we have tried. Some very simple method by which we have solved a problem. But for that you have to really feel the way doctor is feeling for everyone that we have to do something about it. If I say we have some thing within us which can work it out, why not get to it? So precious. Yes, Mother. Yes. This lady is asking. We are from Bridgeport Physical College and I am writing for the paper. And I would like to see if we have something to say for the students. Only some people who are there for group learning and scientific learning. What about the people who are learning? Should that be added together? This lady is coming from Bridgeport. From what? From Bridgeport, it's a city in Connecticut. She is coming from there. She is writing for a newspaper there. And she would like to know if you have a message for students who are learning various disciplines. Should there not also be some process of spiritual learning? Of course. It's not learning. Madam, it's not learning. It's something happening within you. Yes, yes. We can ask some people and you can interview them and they'll tell you. It has changed the attitude of children so much you won't believe. Absolutely. I mean children become so beautiful after coming to such a... and very intelligent, very dynamic, very wise. You see, they talk like grandparents to us. Very sweet. So something that is in them also, it has to manifest. But you know, what is the situation now? I was so shocked to hear that the police has abused two hundred children. How can you do that? But they do it. Again no respect for your own children. I'm happy you are concerned. Such a lot can be done for them. Absolutely. No doubt. We have some schools and we are working it out. Those children you must meet, you'll be amazed to see them. We have to save our children at least from this madness that's going on. In South England, I would say London, there are two thousand children who are twelve years old, less than twelve years old, are taking drugs. Shocking, isn't it? After getting this joyous amrosia within yourself, you just don't do all these things, just you give up. I don't say don't do anything, I never said. But you'll just not do it. You'll not do it. We could be, if we could be of any help, it would be really great. And these people are here, they'll tell you how you can do it. It's very simple. And children are so sweet, I tell you. So innocent, it works so fast, isn't it? They are the quickest to get Self-realization. We have to save them. Not by having organizations to save the child, save the child, but actually giving them their divinity, that's all. Yes? Shri Mataji, last night I asked you two questions. I asked you if the process of Self-realization was only, how could I know that it was a spiritual experience and not just a physical experience? And you said to study it, to learn more about it. And I plan on doing that, and already I believe that it was a spiritual experience. And I've experienced it before. I've been practicing Sahaja Yoga in Paris, New Jersey for two months. The other question I asked you was, is your way the only way? And it's a little hard to understand you, but what I believe you were saying to Me was that Self-realization is the only way, which I also believe. Well, the first question that you asked Me, I think I answered it, didn't I? That, now I say, that you have to know what are these centers. You have to master it. That's the answer of the first. All right. Now the second one you asked Me, is this the only way? Now, in a seed, if you know there's a primule. That primule is the one which shoots off and becomes a shoot. That's the only way. In the same within you, in this triangular bone, which we call as sacrum, perhaps the Greeks knew, because they call it sacred bone, is this residual energy which is your primule, which sprouts. But to become the tree, you have to know all about it. All right, I've answered you. May God bless you. If there are other questions related to, you know, how to learn more about it, we'll ask you to feel a form so that if there are classes in the UN or outside of the UN, which are free classes, you will be informed. If you're interested to know more about how to actualize this experience of Self-realization, just leave your name by the table at the end. Is there any other question? This lady asked you something, Gregor? She asked Me whether she could meet you after this program, Shri Mataji. I said it's going to be easy for you today. All right. What is your proposal? I'm not sure what is this continuing weekly program here in Manhattan. Is it an extension of what you're considering today? Yes, it's a class which takes, I mean, we have to distinguish, okay, this is a class which will take place at the East Side Community Center and that will present what has been just hinted at in a nutshell in the very short time we have available. This will be outside of the framework of this society here. Shri Mataji, it's always bothered me a little bit since your husband was such a high dignitary in the United Nations and has so much visibility and power. Why did you use that more to spread Sahaja Yoga? Well, it's done. Last question? The question is, your husband was a very senior civil servant with the UN and at that time you didn't bring Sahaja Yoga to the UN, you didn't make, why is it so? Ah, no, no, I didn't think that UN was hopeless, no, I didn't want that was. What I felt was my husband is sort of a big boss there and I should not try to use his position. It would not be good, anytime I can get them, I know that. So it is better to be without that feeling that people get, now look at her, this lady is and most of them, Mrs. Chiang Kai Sheik, then we have this lady, that lady, all of them doing lots of things like that with their position of their husbands. I didn't want to bask in his glory. Moreover, it's not proper. Leave them, let them have their freedom to decide and after all I am going to live so I can manage them later on. That is one of the things I thought of that I should not, ah, I should not sort of, because it will be difficult for people to say no to Me. I didn't want to take their freedom. Ah, of course I know UN people will come to Sahaja Yoga, I am sure of it because whatever I know about them they are very intelligent, sooner or later. And they are concerned, they are concerned. Main thing is they are concerned. I just had a comment for Dr. Shri Mataji, we just, Dr. Nutharik who has joined us a few minutes ago Kaskar? I must tell you about Dr. Mutale. Also a very interesting thing happened with him that I was travelling by, I think from Vienna and he got into the plane and sat next to Me and suddenly he started asking Me about yoga and things like that and he came to know who I was. So he said, are you then Mataji Nirmala Devi? I said, yes I am supposed to be. So he said, all right, why not give me realization? I said, all right, have it. And he had it, had it in the aeroplane. He got his realization in the aeroplane. And he said, I was going by another flight but today I suddenly decided to come by this and he got it. While this time I was coming, I think in the plane I gave realization to at least twenty-five people. Really, remarkable! We never even felt the journey. Yes, madam? Would You consider doing it for us, the question? For what? Would You consider doing it for us, is the question? Realization? Regarding your time business, I have to catch a plane. But you are quite capable of getting it. In no time, just now you got it already, you put your hands towards Me, see, most of you must have felt it. Just put your hands. You'll feel a kind of a cool breeze in your hand, or maybe hot sometimes. If it is hot, just forgive everyone, that's all. Are you feeling, madam? So you have got it. Let's see, how many are feeling? Put both your hands up. That's it. May God bless you! Now you have to just see how you grow into it. That's all. I told you that I knew that I'll get you and people in no time like this. Imagine! I didn't do anything, just worked out. You are just proving My faith in you. I think I should take your leave because I have to catch a plane. I'm sorry you see this. Plane business is terrible sometimes. May God bless you! Yeah! Still time, about ten, fifteen, may I? I'll give you a little time. I'll give you a little time. What's your name? Boston. Boston? I'll give you a little time. May God bless you! Let's go to the hospital. He's taking pictures with you, where? Leave me alone. Leave me alone and I'll tell my mother. Hey, give us your name. She said she was someplace else. We're all going to a car spa. Yeah, they were all just in the hospital. I think I'm at your place. So where are you going, big pill? I'm going to the hospital.

This is a recording of the speech given by our Holiness Mataji Nirmala Devi on the third day of the three-day seminar held at CJ Hall from 19 March to 21 March 1976. I thank you very much, all of you, My children, for celebrating My birthday. It is such a rare occasion to see the children treating the Mother so kindly in this Kali Yuga. This is the sign of the advent of Satya Yuga. This is the sign that people are definitely understanding the value of something that is abstract, noble and supreme. Otherwise Mother is always taken for granted. She doesn't ask anything from Her children. She just loves them and looks after their well-being and all the time what She asks is their kalyana, is their salvation. I was very happy to see in those three days we had our seminar in this hall that so many new people have now got realization. The vibrations have started flowing from their finger-tips. For the first time they have felt that there is something beyond them, that there is something that is flowing through them, that they are much more than what they have been before. Now we have to know that these vibrations are nothing else but is a rapport, is a communication with the God Almighty. He has no words for human beings have created this language. These vibrations are telling you something by which you will know what He wants you to do. For example, when I am speaking on this mic, if there is a sound coming then the technician knows that this is what is wrong with this mic and he corrects it. In the same way when the vibrations are flowing from your finger-tips, when you look around, when there is a thought coming in you, when you come in contact with other people and when you are not being able to decide which is right, which is wrong, the vibrations tell you whether it is right or wrong. You know it very well that in this world of today there are many rakshasas who have come in the garb of godly people, but they are not. And ultimately the court of law finds them out. But with vibrations you can find them out in no time. Immediately you can find out which man is real and which is not. Not only that but you can find out the physical problems of the other person. You can find out the mental problems of the other person and also the spiritual problem of the other person. Because now you have become a member of that universal being, that Virataswarupa, who is the macrocosm and you are the macrocosm, means you are the part of that body, you are the cell of that great cell which we call as Virat. Now how are you to communicate? It is through these Chaitanya vibrations. These tell you what God wants you to do. It is very difficult to remember that whenever you want to do something, whenever you want to judge someone, whenever you want to know what is the will of God, so many Sahaja Yogis also forget that they must see the vibrations first. If I am telling you any lies or if anybody is telling you any lies, immediately you can make it out on your vibrations. They are so sensitive and all the time so very alert, it's surprising how they act. It is for the first time such a large number of people have felt them because as I told you before it is the blossom time. But it is the first time that a human being can give something to nature. So far the nature has been providing the human beings with its bounties. But now it is the human beings who can give something to nature. I went to Lahiri where there is a university where they are using these vibrations for developing some crops and they found out with the vibrated water they got ten times more the crop. They got beautiful fruits. The fruits have got such shining luster on their face that you can say that, Ya Devi Sarva Bhuteshu Kanti Rupe Nisasita. You can see the kanti, the luster on these fruits and they are so beautifully tasty. One papaya was given to Me and when I brought it here, after three days also it had not lost its taste nor its luster. It's such a fantastic thing that has happened that you can with your vibrations can give it to nature and make the nature feel the divine within itself. Now what is the scientific thing behind it? Let us see that. The scientific behind all this is that we are not only electromagnetic vibrations. We are not only dead things. We are living beings who think, who understand, who plan. But we are not integrated. In a dead thing like this there is only electromagnetic vibrations in the molecules. Then when it becomes living there is prana. Beyond the prana is the pranava where there are seven powers all together in them. And these seven, basic seven powers I should say because they are actually twenty-one raised to power one thousand powers in prana. But I would say basically seven which can be subdivided later. Basically seven powers in the pranava flow and they enrich the electromagnetic vibrations by synthesis. The analysis has brought about the electromagnetic vibrations one of the many powers of the pranava. And when some of you who are realized put your hands towards anything that is growing, the synthesis takes place and the pranava is increased and that's how you get these beautiful things created out of living things. Even the dead things which we call as dead can be full of prana. For example all our Ganesha's that we have got, Ashtabhini Aikas, they are all not symbols only but they are living Gods because though they look like stones through them these vibrations are coming. Now when I say this it is better that you go and find out for yourself those who are getting vibrations. I had a problem once when I was talking about Mary that she was the Adi Shakti herself. An Indian lady got very angry with me and she said, what did she do except for crying? And I said, what did Sita do except for crying? And what did Radha do except for crying? But they are the embodiment of Shakti and you can see that. So she said, how am I to believe it? I said, you just put your hands and say, is Mary divine power, is she the divine Mother? And immediately she started getting the vibrations. The other person who was doubting it told me that he went to this Matamali temple and he got such a tremendous force of vibrations pouring on to him even when he had not even climbed one step. Our Mahalakshmi temple also is the gift of the nature to you which is a vibrated stone is a fact which you can go and see for yourself. But the people who have used it, the people who are using its powers are making money, are doing all kinds of bad things, they have no right to be there. When such people are there at that spot where the vibrations are coming there is a cloud of darkness over these big great things that nature has given us, the Mother Nature has provided us with and then we start doubting God. But the realized soul in a way is better than those because he understands, he plans, he can clear his vibrations if there is any cloud covers him. Yesterday I gave you the names of all the chakras that are within our being and the centers that they are controlling. Today I would like to tell you what are the things necessary for a person to keep these chakras all right. The first chakra is that of Muladhara chakra. Now Muladhara chakra is a chakra as I told you yesterday that of innocence, innocence of Shri Ganesh. He sits there and emits innocence. Now whether there is Ganesh or not he is there. Whether you see him or not I see him there. He is there, he sits there and he emits. He is vibrations into every human being but he is not awakened in every human being. When you disrespect him by your wrong behavior towards sex he sleeps off. Or sometimes he gets so annoyed with you that you get tremendous heat in your body. I have told you how yesterday the tantricas are trying to displease Shri Ganesha to see that a person gets rid of Shri Ganesh and they use him for his purpose. So you have to be an innocent person. A cunning person is the greatest foolish man ever going round. If he thinks by becoming cunning he has earned anything he has earned nothing but a real passport to hell. There is no need for human beings to be cunning and this worldly wiseness so called has led human beings nowhere in the world. Let God look after you. It is he who does everything for you and once you know this fact you become innocent, absolutely innocent. You are most unprotected to look at but you are the most protected person because Shri Ganesha himself is looking after you. Innocence is the substratum of your religion. It is the substratum of every personality. The person who doesn't know what is innocence is a useless fellow, absolutely useless. He treats this man, he treats that man, he thinks he has earned a lot of money, he has got a big name in the public. People think no innocence. Even in the practical sense you just think of it that no such man is hidden from the public eye. People know that he is a cheat. They know that he is a dishonest man. They know that he has been cheating each and every person. He may cheat for a while here, he may cheat for a while there. But I have not met one man so far who has been a cheat and who has carried away with it even in one lifetime. The cheating, I'm not saying anything that is political, but cheating within yourself. You are all the time cheating yourself. If you are cheating others nothing is gained but actually you are cheating yourself. You are losing all the chances of your ascendance to the Divine, to the blissful life of a saintly personality. If you have made laws, actually it is the idea of keeping human beings away from that kind of a behaviour by which they not only have a very bad time on this earth but also in the later life when they go to hell. An innocent person may be troubled by others. People think an innocent person is always troubled by others. It is a wrong idea. You do not know how God helps us. You just watch and see after your realization that at every step you'll find there's a help coming from somewhere and how you are helped. Of course my life is full of such experiences but even so many of those who are realized can tell you how God has been helpful to them and how he has guided their path with his intelligence. His intelligence is the source of all the intelligence of the world and when you depend on his intelligence he guides you, he looks after you, every need that you have. So the people who say it's no use being innocent I have to tell them one thing that you do not understand. You are still blind, you have not yet felt that your father is such a kind father. He is looking after you and I thus say there are two types of sins we are committing all the time. One is the sin against the father when we feel so insecure in life. Whatever you may have you feel insecure when God has given us such bounties. Just think of what things he has given us, how he has made this beautiful earth for you, how he has adjusted this earth, the way it is going, the way it is moving, the way it is flowering, the way it is giving you all that you need. It is you, the human beings have made the misery here and such a God is going to look after you as long as you depend on him entirely and believe in him that, O Lord, you are our father, look after us. Give us this day our daily bread. This is the sin we are committing in this country. In the West we are committing the another type of sin which I call the sin against the mother. Where we do not understand what is our sustenance, we do not understand what we have to respect what are the things which are sublime in life, where we have to respect our chastity, we have to respect our pavitrata, the holiness within ourselves. These are the two types of sins I describe them which both are managed by Shri Ganesh Aundhi. If you could know how to be innocent you will never commit any sin against God or against the mother because mother is looking after the innocent being. She is all the time bothered, whenever you remember her, whenever you think of her, she is there to look after her and she gives a promise, she gives you her protection. You feel her, you feel her being around you all the time protected just like her achal, her sari covered with little child near her heart and she looks after you. It is a sin to all the time feel insecure because your father is almighty. He can look after every small thing that you have and every big thing that you demand, he is there to look after. But if you ask him for something that is so tutcha, so useless, he is a father who has an intelligence, who understands he is not going to give you something useless. He is going to give you something eternal, you ask for the eternal and there you will find, you will find everything being fulfilled. You become yourself the king, you yourself become the bhatsha if you can rise over this fear of insecurity. This fear of insecurity is very much in this country. I find every third person suffering from it. You may give them realization, still this problem exists. Nobody seems to be satisfied, nobody has samadhan. Whatever you have got you have no samadhan. Now just watch around yourself, you have got a wife, you have got children, you can go out, you can play around. Now why should you not have samadhan? Now people will immediately get up and say, what about the poor people? I am thinking about you. You don't put your attention to something else where you are not going to help. Actually if you become realized you can remove the poverty of this country in no time like that. Only through realization you can remove the poverty of this country, not otherwise. Because then the bounties of Lakshmi which rests on the third chakra as I have told you, on the third chakra of Nabhi is awakened. She is awakened. I have told you about Lakshmi how She is. But what should we have for the temperance? What should we have for this chakra to be all right? I had said that this chakra is for your sustenance, for your dharma. Now what is your dharma? I find a man here who is torturing other people. He is troubling other people and he wants, Mother my child is very sick, you must cure him. Why should I? What is your bank balance with your God that I should cure that child? Mother you must do good to my child, something is wrong with him, I am very upset, this has happened, that has happened. Why should I do it? Why should God worry about a person who has no dharma, no love for other children? Whatever good you do today your children are going to reap it and not only children but in future the whole world is going to reap. Any saintly person he may live in the forest, his good deeds, his good thoughts and his good vibrations have always enriched this Mother Earth and because of that she has been able to bear the heavy weight of the cricket. The egoistical people who think no end of themselves want their children to be so obedient, they will smoke, they will drink before their children. They will have no dharma of any kind, no mariada of any kind and they would expect their children to be the best citizens ever born. How do you expect that to happen? For the Nabhi Chakra what you should do? Today somebody asked me, Mataji, everybody is Nabhi is caught, what should we do? Nabhi Chakra is the most important chakra in a human being and Nabhi Chakra represents ten petals, there are ten sub-plexuses to the solar plexus which is controlled by Nabhi Chakra. It is given in the Bible, the ten commandments that gives a little rough idea as to what should one do as to have those ten petals all right. The dharma in the stomach has to be first balanced. Once you have a balanced temperant dharma then you become dharmati, you go beyond any sustenance where you yourself become sustenance. You cannot do wrong after that but first of all your Nabhi Chakra is to be settled. Now how to settle the Nabhi Chakra? Some people have a foolish idea by doing mechanical things you can do Nabhi Chakra. We have some mad people here, some Sahaja Yogis also all the time doing like this, doing like that. They do not understand it is not to be that mechanical, it is a living thing, it is awareness which understands, it is a thing that feels and you must know that it can be described as a heart and a brain and a mind combined together exist in the stomach of the man. Now the food we eat, start it from there. When we eat the food we must vibrate it, I am talking for Sahaja Yogis, put your hands for the food. See that in your family nobody is starving, that the servants are not starving, that the cattle is not starving, see to it that you give something out of your food to others. I have seen people so insensitive in life that in their own family the sister if she is a widow she doesn't get the food and the lady is nicely eating her food. How can she? The food that you eat has to be vibrated. Now it doesn't mean by any chance that you should have certain vitamins and this and that. It means the food that you have earned out of your sweat. It is not the food earned by troubling others, by taking away somebody's rights or something like that, but your own earnings in your own family, cooked in love by your own family people or if you have servants who are a member of your family such a food should be. But food is not so important. Again the way we make fuss about food that all our religion has gone into kitchen. There are two types of fusses we have, extremes. One is that people do not eat, they fast. All the time they are fasting. This is a sin against the mother I say. The way you are fasting the mother feels hurt. It's a funny thing but if I tell you that nobody should fast when there is any celebration but you can fast when there is a thing where you have to feel sorry for it. While I find people fast at the time when you have to celebrate. This is a very wrong idea and you are just going opposite the play of the evolution. That time you have to be happy and jubilant. Supposing at the blossom time some trees do not blossom then what do we call? We call them sick. In the same way we are sick people that we do not catch the time when we have to be happy and when we have to be unhappy, when we have to be fasting. But when it comes to eating we are very much eating time. India I think is the worst as far as food is concerned. Morning till evening we are thinking of food and food and food. We'll talk across what did you have yesterday, what did I have today. We are such eaters I tell you and such tongueers because nowhere in the world you'll find people who talk of food. We are so much particular about what we eat as far as the taste is concerned. Now the UP people cannot eat South Indian food, South Indian people cannot eat Sindhi food, Sindhi people cannot eat Bengali food, all kinds of problems. So much so that we cannot eat one type of fish, we cannot eat another type of meat. In a country which is said to be suffering from food shortage how can we afford to be so fussy no one understands. It is something funny that nobody understands how can people be that fussy about food. They may be having one meal but even there they'll be extremely fussy about food. Such fussy people are no good for vibrations. They have no good vibrations because all their attention, their chitta is lost in a tuksha thing like taste. It is tuksha, it is useless. Your attention which has to reach the Divine is lost in all these things. The second thing about the food I have told you that you are not to be extremist. Whatever you get at whatever time you just eat it, you just forget it. Whether you hide it or not makes no difference. Sometimes I really fast because I do not do it deliberately but automatically sometimes it happens that nobody is in the house I just forget about the food. Then the servant will tell me that you didn't have your breakfast, didn't have your lunch, you didn't have your dinner. I said really I didn't know that. All right I'll have something to eat now. Like that it goes on. But I'm quite hell and hot. So so much fuss is made about food in this country is not behaving the wisdom and the background we had. We are the people who are born in the yoga food. This is a saintly country. Every particle of it is touched by the feet of Sita and Ram who walk for you without any shoes just to vibrate this country. This is the Kundalini of the whole world. Here people are not going to waste their energy and their taste in horrible things like worrying about food. It's a shameful thing when I see even the rich and the poor, all of them so much worried about the taste of food. That doesn't mean you should not have any taste, I'm not saying that. Of course you all have too much so it's better to say that you shouldn't have any taste. Whatever you may try you will still have being Indians. We can never solve our food problems because of fussy nature. And we boast of it. Mala hai aoda toh suna hai, mujha toh yeh paasandhi nahi hai, mujha iska shaoki nahi hai. We boast of it. Just think of it. Why food, what is so important about it? Just a part of it. Just when you have it you can have it or if you don't have it you don't have it. It is not so important. The way we give importance to these useless things spoils our chances of evolution. Now in the temperance you should come as far as the religion is concerned also. There are people who are extremists in this country. We are the greatest product of extremism. You will see that here now if I go and talk to Christians about the integration of religion which exists within ourselves as a fact, they'll say, you get out from here. But the Christians in the Western countries will listen to me. If I talk to the Muslims that you are fanatics and this is not religion but religion is that you stop your drinking, which Mohammed has told you. Here the Muslims will cut my throat I think. But in Iran they listen to me for this. They give up their drinking. Everybody's religion seems to be in danger in this great country of religion itself. Where the religion itself has been established, the Kumba has been established in this beautiful land. The everybody's religion seems to be in danger. Some people came to tell me, what are you going to do about the saving of Hindu religion. I said, what is happening to Hindu religion? Out of this fear they have developed sectarian. Out of this nonsensical ideas of creating caste in birth they have created this problem within us. Now let us decide that the caste is not according to your birth but according to your temperament. Today only in the morning I have told you that Vyasa the one who wrote Gita was a child of a fisher woman and his father was Parasharmuni. Is a fact, is a historical fact but still will stick on to it saying that we are higher caste and lower caste. I went to Pune and there, they are very Brahmin minded some people, they said, Mataji you are not a Brahmin, you cannot speak in this hall. I said, all right let me see who is a Brahmin. They came before me and they started shaking like this. I said, why are you shaking? They said, because you are a Shakti we are shaking. I said, if I am a Shakti you are shaking. There are some people from the mad house they are also shaking the same. You are mad with the idea of these fanatic things that have gone into your head. Every human being has got a Kundalini. You must know that and once you disrespect anybody under these false denominations and these false identifications you must know that you are sinning against God by doing that. So to speak about any religion in that fashion is a sin. That's what Sai Baba has said again and again. He was a Muslim when he died all of them tortured his life because he was born in a Muslim family and when he died the same people were born and now doing Aarti Sai Baba there. To understand religion in its true manner is the sustenance, is the dharma within yourself. You understand in its essence what is religion. Sitting before God, mechanically doing something without feeling anything about it creates such a problem for you that to give you realization is an impossibility. Thank God, by God's grace such great sages have been born in this country like Yogavasishta, like Shri Shankaracharya. They have written all about it. They have written that religion comes within yourself spontaneously and it has nothing to do with all these horrible karyas we are doing. But ask the other people who are following them. Those who have got pithas are talking of caste by birth. There cannot be a caste by birth for a Hindu at least if you believe in the reincarnation of life. Because today you are born a Hindu today and maybe you might have been born a Muslim. I have seen many Muslims in Iran doing Aarti and I have seen many Hindus, Brahmins doing namas. Extremists are born from one extreme to another. Here they are born as mulats and there they are born as these pandits. They are all against anti-religion. They can never accept the saint. They can never accept religion because they live by destroying religion within you. Because they are pet panna hotaana. They look after their stomach by destroying your religion. Savaarupya do, acha kar change nahi hai toham dete. These kind of people have ruined this country and they are all sitting in the temples. I went to this Vrindaban and I was shocked that all these rakshasas who were with Kansa are born there as pujaris and all of them are rakshasas, one better than the other I tell. Terrible rakshasas they are. You can feel their vibrations. You can't stand on those temples even for one minute. You burn the temple the way they are there. They are the most hated people at the time of Krishna and today they are the people who are looking after the temple of Shri Krishna. A day will come that's why. People like Mohammed Ghazni came and destroyed these things because you are the people who run after some persons who are just befooling you all the time. So the force of nature comes and destroys it and that's how Somnath, such a great temple was destroyed. It is our doing, the way we fall at such feet. Those people who are not to be even kicked by you, the way we run after them and listen to them in every temple today, in every masjid and in every church will find these people in the guard of rakshasas. I don't say all of them are like that. I never say that but there are many like this. Now for you to decide when you are realized, you have got vibrations, when you go to temple first of all feel the vibrations of the deek. Just you are not concerned with anybody else but the deek. Then you are concerned with the person who is sitting there and who is putting the tilap on you. You don't allow anybody to touch your aagya. It's a very important point that everybody is putting here. From the very beginning when the child is born, I have seen my own daughter's delivery that the lady who came to give a bath to the child was working on the aagya very nicely. I told her, you dare not touch her head. When they put their hands on this chakra from the very childhood, imagine what is the plight of the child. Then in the temples you go, in the churches you go. You take blessings from those people who are unauthorized and what they give is nothing but a devil into you. So in religion also you have to be alert and for that alertness God has given you these vibrations. To use them wherever you go in every book, whatever you read, take the essence out of it. Do not read only because you want to read it but to take out the essence by which you get the final and then you tally it, parthara karunge hai nahi hai. You must tally it whatever you have known before, is it coming true or not. But if you start sitting on the outside of this hall reading Mataji Nirmala Devi's program going on and reading the advertisement there and sitting down there and thinking that you are attending my program and also getting realization, then how to describe it? So for religion you have to be extremely alert and for that you have got these vibrations. You have to be very alert to know what is religion. It gives you guidance, it gives you help, it gives you moral courage. We had somebody with us, a young boy from a very rigid family and in his family there is a custom that they take a newly married bride to a temple where she has to use a matka and he is teaching something about sex. He came as soon as he saw me and he went round and round and round, I don't know, so fast, just like a fan and he fell on me and I was shocked. I said, where have you been my child? He was so proud, I am very happy, I am all peaceful. I said, this is the way you are peaceful, just now you are so badly hurt. But they are so happy with the possession. He just went round and round and round for about five minutes, just imagine, and he just fell flat and he thought, oh he is God. That is what you have to know in your Nabhi chakra, that you are not to get possessed. The possessions mostly appear on the Nabhi chakra and that is the reason why on the left hand side the Nabhi is got, is impossible, is very difficult to excite. It is very difficult to take out the possession. I have to use so many methods to take out the possession. The people do not believe in possessions. We had a very learned and a very well posted gentleman who came to my program and he started just feeling like that before me. He said, Mother what is happening to me? I said, will you believe me if I tell you there is a possession in you? He said, I do not believe in a possession. I said, you don't believe in it, but you have it. You'll have to take it out. If you do not take it out, you'll have this problem. But he says, I have this problem only with you. Yes, of course, because I can frighten that possession in you. And he is getting frightened before. Then I removed that possession, but he told me that he had a severe pain all the time in the head and now it's gone and finished. We must decide that we are going to be all right. We are going to be rid of possession. We are not going to feel shy of it. We are not going to continue with them because we have some false ideas about our own dignity. There is no dignity in being dominated by possessions. So the Nabhi chakra is very important when you eat your food or when you try to bend before anybody like that, or if you have extreme ideas of religion, if you fast too much or indulge too much, if you drink, then of course Nabhi chakra is definitely important. Too much drinking is a difficult case, but if you are slightly drinking you can get realization and the drinking drops out, even your smoking drops out. There is no prohibition for a person who comes to Sahaja Yoga, but after coming to Sahaja Yoga, after receiving it, you must know that drinking is the greatest foolish thing that man has ever discovered. Even worse than atom bomb. Even atom bomb could be controlled, but this horrid thing that was discovered, I don't know how, by fermentation or whatever it is, when it started working into you people, it has spread like that, like a possession, like an ugly possession into you and once you start smoking, you go on smoking and you go on drinking. Is the worst habit that man can have is drinking. But drinking need not be, even before coming to Sahaja Yoga. Now those who drink will not like it when I tell them, because they think drinking is the greatest bliss in the world. Even we have written poetry on drinking, but drinking is against your religion. It takes you away from your awareness, I am telling you the truth, for that you should not feel bad. Now we have other chakras here which is, I have avoided the second chakra which is known as the Swadhisthana chakra, because it looks after itself. Is the creativity and the creativity that flows into you, the planning that comes to you, the thinking that comes to you, is through this chakra and for that chakra you don't have to do much, because it is worked out by itself. But sometimes that also goes upset because of over creativity or a feeling that I have done, I have done that. Even a man like great king Shivaji was once little bit corrected by his great guru, Samarth Ramadasa. He corrected him because he felt that he is building the fort. This little idea went into his head and he immediately came and corrected to him and Shivaji, he was a very humble disciple, he accepted the correction and because of that he is so great. Never think that you are doing anything but it is done by him. This is the best way to keep your Swadhisthana chakra all right. Everything is done by him, a vairagya, a kind of a detached feeling should be developed, but it is rather difficult so through Sahaja Yoga when you realize then suddenly you become a detached person. That's why I do not insist too much on this Swadhisthana chakra. So it is very important after realization. After that is the chakra here in the center of the heart. Heart center is controlling on both the sides. One side it is controlling the heart organ, on the other side it is controlling Sri Rama's Mariyada. It is Sri Ram who exists on the right hand side and it is Shiva who resides in the heart. So their qualities are managed by them. For Shiva you need not worry at all because Shiva is the Existence. But those who are Hatha Yogis who try too much of energy, too much of running about, too much of Atikarmata, such people suffer from the drainage, from the energy of Shiva and that's how they get heart attacks. Most of the Hatha Yogis who live in their mundane life, in their regular life of a householder get this heart attack. A Hatha Yogi has to live in the jungle. He has to live with a guru. With six things together he has to work it out simultaneously. And that's why these people when they get heart attack you are surprised that they look very healthy but how do they get it? So too much of strenuous exercises also are not good for this chakra. But in the center of this chakra is the most important thing is known as sacred heart where Sri Durga the Devi resides. Durga Devi is the mother, she is the Jagadamba. She is your mother and for you must know how to please your mother. Mother can be easily pleased. She is so easily pleased because she is always trying to make you happy. How to make your mother happy is she doesn't like that her child should take to things which are not good for him or the child should starve himself or the child should be unhappy. All these things work out here. So when you have a problem in this part you should just say that, oh mother forgive us because we did not know that we will displease you and she is Prasanna. This Texas is extremely important from Sahaja Yogi's point of view because you have been realized through the motherhood. You have been realized through a special method of Sahaja Yogi. I told you yesterday that it was like the pattern of Shri Ganesh. So for you it is necessary to know that women are the embodiment of the Shakti and your mother if you disrespect her she is not going to like you. You have to respect your mother, you have to respect sisters, you have to respect other women in this world and you have to respect your wife, you have to respect the women because they carry the Shakti. But the women who do not carry the Shakti, the women who are ruined and spoiled are not the women about whom I am talking. Such women are actually you'll be surprised are the outcome of the foolish treatment of men who try to worship women who are bad. For example in the West you find they worship women who are not at all davies, they are not goddesses, they are in no way they can be called as something sublime, they are horrid, they are like rakshas. You see now recently you have read about Elizabeth Taylor, you have read about Jacqueline Kennedy, you have read about these women. How can you call them davies? You cannot call them davies. There is no davies in them. The women have to be like goddesses. They themselves have to be goddesses and that God gives them power to be that. All such women are respected, have to be respected. If they are not respected then the prostitutes will come and rule you, then the bad women will come and rule you, then the hirimbas will come and shurpadakhas will come and they will try to spoil your family life. Always the goddess Devi should be appreciated and worshipped so that she generates her Devi-hood, her saintliness into other women. A woman doesn't dominate, she does not, she is not meant for domination but she has a capacity to take all the domination onto herself like this Aarti, this Dharai. She takes all the domination into herself. She is much more powerful than the man is. She can take all that into herself and she can bear it. She can. It is the power of a woman who can do it. The more you are powerful the more you can do it. So the women who start calling themselves to be men or sort of, we must fight with men and we must become like men are really foolish because they want to come down. Men are depending on their power. So the women are respected who have this power and respect such women and tell them because their understanding of things is more intuitive. They understand things intuitionally. You tell them whatever you think is wisdom and listen to them also because they too have intuition if they are God-like women. On top of that is the chakra of Shri Krishna as I told you yesterday which is called as Vishuddhi chakra. I told you yesterday also that it has got sixteen plexuses, sub-plexuses and it has got two more things added to it that the ego and superego arise from that point. Now this is how a human being is controlled by Shri Krishna. And who is Shri Krishna? Shri Krishna is the aspect of God which represents Virat. He is the great primordial being. He is the whole in which we are all there. So when you feel small, when you feel dominated or when you dominate others it is He whom you are insulting. It is He whom you are not paying any attention to. He is great so why should you dominate anybody else? When He is great why should you take domination from anybody else? The person who is balanced doesn't take any domination from anybody neither allows anybody to dominate Him. Now in this case one should understand that nobody can dominate nobody as long as they are one with themselves. Domination is such an artificial thing outside. When you are powerful you dominate in a way because you are so powerful it flows, the power flows to others. But it is the power of love that flows. Shri Krishna's the greatest thing of His life, the message of His life of Shri Krishna is this. When Shri Krishna has said that the whole world is a leela and you are a witness. This is the essence of His incarnation that you are a witness, you are just a Sakshi of the whole thing. That's why we call Him as a Purana, as the complete incarnation because He saw the whole world as a leela and He has told you that the whole world is a leela. This is the essence of the Virad who plays, who at His whim plays, He creates, He recreates, He destroys, He does it. He is the one who enjoys. It is He who freaks, it is He who does, we are just watching as a witness. I've told this story of Radhaji who was jealous of the flute and she asked, Radhaji once, Radhaji asked the flute, that, why are you so near to his lips all the time, what is so special about you? So the flute answered, my speciality is that I have no speciality, I'm a hollow personality. Because I'm hollow He plays through me very well. I do not stand anywhere in between and when He plays I do not destroy His play, I just watch. And I laugh at people when they say that I play because they cannot see the great artist behind it. It's like that, you have to be a witness. And you become a witness as soon as you get your realization through Sahaja Yoga because you go into thoughtless awareness. All your problems drop out like that, you feel the whole load has come down, you feel so relaxed because you are just a witness of the play, you are seeing the waves coming this way and waves going that way. You are now on the boat, you are not afraid of getting drowned. This is what He calls at the witness state and that happens to Sahaja Yogis which they know automatically develops. With some people they have to little bit assert themselves and to stand there and remember it. Now, of course there are so many chakras so I have to go in a very short way. We come now to the most important also the chakra which we call in the brain which is called as the Agnya chakra. Now at this point both the ego and superego are controlled like a screw. If you move it this way it goes this way, if you move it this way it moves this way. First the superego was very much developed in the human beings. Then the ego started developing too much and when it has come in the center the thing has worked out and you go beyond ego and superego you cross here and you come up and you see both of them going down and then you become one with the ego of God. Then he works, you just watch the whole thing, the whole Maya drops out and you know it's a balloon that goes down. So the controlling point is the Agnya is very good. But we spoil our Agnya by many things. First of all and the foremost is that concentrate on this point. I don't know who has told them this. To concentrate on this point is the worst thing that you can do to your Agnya chakras because all such people have spoiled their Agnya. Agnya should not be spoiled. Supposing we have to make a door. Now we start pushing on one side all the force that we have then the main door is lost. The door is here, not here. So why to do this door first I don't understand. What you have to do is to come up here and then through all these doors you have to go down. But actually we have broken this door and we are spoiled. There are many ways by which we spoil our Agnya and the worst of all is through possessions. We go on catching possessions for everyone. Our eyes are responsible for that. Now you must respect your eyes. The way we move our eyes at every small thing that is going on, the way we call it the Chanchali, spoils the Agnya. I always tell my western disciples that put your eyes little downward. When Lakshmana was asked to describe Sita Ji he said, I have never seen anything else but her feet and so I only know what ornament she had on her feet. I would say like that you have to put down your eyes and watch in such a way that your eyes are not all the time turning down. Not concentration but a sublimation, a kind of a feeling, a respect for your eyes. Do not raise your eyes at every point. There is no need to raise your eyes and it is a very good thing. It creates a great dignity. I'm in London and where I'm living it's a place where there are no Indians living and they don't know even that I'm Mataji or anything. But my habit of walking is that I always put my eyes down and walk. So you see those people have started saying that this lady is something very unique because she never raises her eyes. You have seen her eyes are always down. Raising your eyes all the time and moving them upside down or on the sides is a very wrong thing. Out of that so many bad habits which we call as flirting and all that have come. Keep down your eyes and all the time looking at all the things that are displayed, these plastic shops that you have around. This is there, that is there, that is there. All the Lalasya everything goes through the eyes. So it is very important if you want to control your thoughts, control your eyes. Doesn't mean that you concentrate but keep it down. Keep it to the earth. She is there, she is your mother. She gives you that dignity. Keep the dignity of your eyes. It is very necessary because you'll lose all the luster of your eyes. You'll have all kinds of problems. Most of the people who are mad I've found they have their Agnya. I mean ninety nine point nine percent people have got a bad Agnya. If you want to keep your Agnya all right please never allow your eyes to go very much. If it has formed a habit try to put it down. It's easy. Even the foreigners can do it but they are much more obedient because they feel so lost that whatever I tell them they are willing to do they are much more obedient than My Indian disciples are. Because they have realized that they have reached a point from where they are just going to break. They have reached the last point of breaking and that's why when I tell them that you have to put down their eyes they walk like this. For me it doesn't matter whether I raise my eyes or keep them down but when I raise my eyes I find some people start shaking, some people feeling nervous, some people elated. So automatically I feel concerned about them so I put my eyes down so that their Agnya is not excited and their possessions do not disturb them when they are just walking on the street. That is how we spoil our Agnya many a times. There are many things but one of them I have told you. The last, the most important is the Sahasrara where we have got one thousand nerves. But when they are enlightened they look like flames. I have seen them. They look like one thousand flames, living flames just like this. And these flames when they open out, they open out like that, like a lotus. And that's why in the Bible it is said that I will appear before you like tongues of flames. But these Christians will they understand what does that mean? It is such a mysterious book because if it were not that mysterious I think they would have killed even the twelve disciples of Christ. So these one thousand petals are very important. And there resides Adi Shakti, the complete integration, the complete form of all these incarnations. She is the person who organizes and coordinates and arranges and puts things together. That's why at the Sahasrara you have to come and the Sahasrara is broken and from there flows your own chitta into this all-pervading power and you feel these vibrations, these things flowing onto you. For the first time your central nervous system feels the Divine. Before this your central system did not know. It only knew the touch of hot, cold and things. But now you feel a person is hot or a cold. You feel a person is burning you. You feel the blisters in your fingers when you look at somebody. You sometimes feel that a person is giving you beautiful cool vibrations. I feel very happy, oh what an idea. As if you are getting the fragrance of that person. First time you develop that nose you develop those eyes, chakshu, a special one that gives you the idea of the Divine. This subject as I have told you is so much and many a times I had to repeat so many things because every time we get new people. But in any case I have to give you a good news on this auspicious day that we have been able to purchase a beautiful property in Khar. This place is known as Maya and is on the seventeenth route. And this is a place where we are going to have our meditation center, also a office for people who want to go and also will have a brain trust, people who will explain to you what is Kundalini. How to master it. After realization do not give it up because it's a very great thing you have got it. Now you can master it. You become the masters of Kundalini. Just like by raising your fingers. You are going to give realization to people because I have told you that you are made after the pattern of Shri Ganesha who was all powerful. No one could cross his powers. In the same way you the Sahaja Yogis today I promise you, you try, you will have such tremendous powers if you keep your chakras all right. Try to keep them all right and these are the powers of God for which you are working. You are made for that. You are the chosen ones who are being selected by God to do His work and to do His glorious and beautiful complete edifice of Satya. You are the foundation and there are thousands of children who will be born who will know vibrations from their childhood. They will know Kundalini from their childhood. They will work out on the Kundalini shastra. You will be amazed how they know about it. I have seen my own grandchild the way she is so clever at Kundalini. Immediately she will put on to that. She will bring something and push on to that man and take out his position. I have seen many children being born and I have told you thousands of them will be born but they will be later on. You are the foundation. Sahaja Yogi has no business to be frivolous, to be cheapest, to be egoistical and to be fighting for small songs, small differences. You are not that. You are chosen people. Understand your dignity. Understand your position. You have been raised from an ordinary human level to this great level of his Sahaja Yogi. I expect you to have the attention placed into yourself and to understand your value, your worth. You are a diamond and diamond is not thrown in the dust but is put on the pedestal. You are enlightened. Do not put your lights under the tables. It is to be put on the topmost places from where people can see. Today it is the last day perhaps that I'll be meeting you. Now I'm going away from Bombay and then I'll be going away from India about the 15th of April. I have given my maximum time to Bombay people in the whole world. Of course I am now in London, supposed to be in London, but most of the time I'm travelling and I'm travelling all over to meet my children all over. But you are the greatest blessed people in this whole world and that's why the responsibility is greater because of certain reasons. You were here and I was here and it was done. But feel your responsibility. Don't be frivolous. Go deep down into it and take the charge. We have to change this world. We are the people who are going to ignite it. We are the people who are going to trigger it and we have to bring about the advent of Satyugas, which should take only two years more, I think, to start. And as I have told you, in the year 99 it will be established. I may not live to see the great work of my children who are so simple, so ordinary. They are not exceptional people. They are very simple people but they are great, very great sages who have been searching and today they are born as ordinary people in Bombay. May God bless you all on this day, on this day when I feel that I may not be able to see you again and despite all my efforts I could not give much time this time also to you. Next time I hope to come here but see to it that you go to your meditation. Every Tuesday we have and we have some other days you should take the address and devote time for your meditation and for your growth and your evolution so that others may be helped. And you tomorrow in the annals of history will go as the great pioneers of Sahaja Yoga. May God bless you. May God bless you. Ladies and gentlemen, I do not know what to say because we are all, those of us who can receive them are drowned in the vibrations not only of the presence of Mataji but of a divine word. I can only wish on this occasion many, many happy returns of Mataji. Not only in the usual sense but the many happy returns in our presence so that we can hear these wonderful words and feel these wonderful vibrations. What these vibrations are I must confess that I cannot explain or describe in the way in which mother can explain. But I am also one of you who feel the vibrations. Whenever I remember mother I immediately get those vibrations, cool breezes which put me into a very serene sense of peace. I can't explain to you anything more but I only congratulate you for what you have been feeling and experiencing because after all religion and God are matters of experience, peace, love and lustre inside you. Andhara Jyoti. Thank you very much for listening to these few words, after listening to the words which came out from the depth of experience of a kind which cannot be described in books or described in words. I bow to the mother on behalf of you all and I wish her many, many years of this divine service to humanity. Thank you. Thank you.

To meet you all here, it has been always such a pleasure. But this time I felt you are very much in the ocean of joy, enjoying yourself. That is the greatest satisfaction for me. The best way to feel your joy is to give realizations to others. That is the real ego you get of your voice of truth. Greatest happiness comes to you when you really are able to give realizations to others. In other countries, as they have started, you are also doing here, that you go round the places, in the villages, in the neighborhood, and talk to them about Sahaja Yoga, how it has changed your life, how you are benefited, with your conviction. If that could be done and if people are convinced about the genuineness, you can do a lot for your country by transforming people. As it is, Sahaja Yoga has grown so much in here. Of course, sometimes we have some people who have tried to harm us. But so far, nobody tried to harm Sahaja Yoga. They have got out of Sahaja Yoga quietly and disappeared. But yesterday's incident has upset many people. But I have discovered that this man was a pauper and was looked after by Sahaja Yogis. He lived with a leader and was somehow or other managing to live. You see, he's a pauper. But has been bought, I think, by some organization, must be this Christian organization, and they must have propped him up. Because for a person who has no money, anybody can buy it. So there's nothing to be disturbed because they do like this. But I am surprised how he has given all false information in that. I don't know if you know, my husband has donated five thousand pounds when he was here. By cheque also that was done. So, no question. Always, you see, so far, my all expenses, everything, I tried to pay myself for so many years. Only about three years back they have started paying for my traveling, that's all. But you don't want me to pay even for my traveling if I am coming to give salvation. I mean, it's going too far. It's not that I have to gain anything out of Sahaja Yoga. It is you have to gain. All it is, it should not disturb you at all because there are some horrible negative people, among us also, who can be purchased by money. Now, another plan I have, which is very good, that I said I'll, I'm willing to donate thirty to forty thousand dollars to Sahaja Yoga here because they want to buy a plot of land. But I think you people are so many, you should also donate some money yourself. After all, you are all earning, not that you can't donate. So you also should donate some money so we can buy a nice plot of land, where we can shift for such a big group. You understand, we don't have enough room in the Burwood Ashram. So we can build a nice ashram for you and a place for you, where you can be settled now. But everybody must cooperate. Everybody must know that we have to save some money for this purpose. Nobody is going to force you, nobody is going to be compelled, nothing is going to be disclosed. But for your own satisfaction, I think, it's important that you people also pay some money for this work. It's very important. Everybody should feel responsible for Sahaja Yoga. That's the best way to enjoy Sahaja Yoga. If you don't feel responsible, individually you cannot enjoy. Individually there's no joy for Sahaja Yoga. Only in collective feeling you can have it. You see, I was amazed how people were so enthusiastic, so many years back in India, when they built this Ajanta Caves, for eleven centuries it was built, tuned out of a big rock, and those people had never even seen Buddha. They had never talked to him, they had no connection. They never wrote to him. And these people were so dedicated that they stayed in that place which was very remote, they lived there, and they built it up with a very great enthusiasm for eleven centuries. Means, I don't know how many generations must have worked it out, how the whole plan must have worked out, and it's one of the wonders of the world. So, we have to understand that if you decide you being realized souls, you can do a lot. But always try to think and find out what are we doing for Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja Yoga has done so much for us. What are we doing? If we can find out, then we'll realize that we have still to do something for Sahaja Yoga. It's very important and whatever is possible, I will try to donate and do the work. Whatever is possible, I can plan for you. But you people should also realize that something has to be done by you. Though you are all very well placed now, you are very happy people. So this is how you will enjoy that you are working out something for Sahaja Yoga. I was very much impressed by the work what Joe has done, and of course our leader Michael Fogarty has been very careful, very sensible and very kind. But now I was thinking we should have a very dynamic leader and I have talked to him about it, because so many people will be now coming to Sahaja Yoga. You'll have to deal with them. And when you are dealing with them, remember that you are Sahaja Yogis. You are not going to be able to do it, not to lose temper, not to get angry with them, be kind to them. And also try to talk less and do more, raising their Kundalini, raising it. Don't touch them, that's not necessary. Nice to see you. moment. If you're looking from fields, you can't tell them. I'm going to check for Jiang Crist. Until him, somebody knows whatteCada has done. It's one of his sisters. Don't touch them at all. So you can see them. If you touch them around together, you're looking for them. Until then, you have to そう you go. So you can see all the alerts that are there, and listen, and listen to all the alerts tool etc.,

I'm sorry I had to speak in this language because I was just correcting them and telling them that they should keep to their own culture. Some of them talk like American women, you know, I was surprised the language has become so rude. Just can't understand how can they talk like that. They have to be, see in our country women are specially very humble, and this language is very compassionate, very, very docile type of language that makes another person very comfortable. But if you develop this American culture, I don't know, half of the America is already mad, and here also the same madness will come. We don't want that culture to come in. We want a very compassionate, good, kind, and a beautiful culture to come in, by which others will learn from us. Our children will be helped in every way. It's much more helpful if you are humble. To be arrogant, it takes nothing. I am happy to see the Australians have become so very humble because what I knew about Australia was horrible. I used to be frightened to meet any Australian. First they used to drink so much and they would shake your hand so much that the hand would come out. And there was no limit to what they would drink, how much they would drink. And they would also talk all rubbish after that. One could not understand what they are talking. I mean, just the whole language was different. Now you are such beautiful people. Like lotuses have come out of this mixed up, confused culture, and you should be the ones who should represent this, our Sahaj culture. People should see you and know that these are people of Sahaj culture. Sahaj culture. I know that there are funny things that are going on and I have written a book on this, a very interesting book which will be available to you after my birthday, where I have described how we have gone wrong, what has gone wrong with our Western life. Sahaj Yoga is a very good, Sahaj Yoga is a very good, prosperous, healthy Sahaj life. And to your children, to all of them, I must say that Sahaj Yoga has taken very good roots in Australia, because it is Shri Ganesha's country. His blessings are working. That's why we all are here and are feeling the joy of Shri Ganesha. Any problem you have, you tell me. Moreover, I met some people who are sick, who need your help. Try to understand how to cure them and try to help them. Don't touch them. You can take bandhans before doing anything and you'll be protected. May God bless you all.

So, who is the Mooladhara? Shri Mataji- Who is the Mooladhara, who is the Mother Earth, made from the Mother Earth, the creation. Then the Bhurva is the whole Antariksa, means the whole universe, the creation of material things, material things, like all the planets and things. Then the third one, I said was Swaha, the Nabhi, is the consumption. Swadha is the, that is the five thing, five, five principle is the consumption part. Swadha is the, um, sustenance, swadha. There are two things in the Nabhi Jaya. Swadha is the, um, the, um, the, um, the, um, the, um, the, um, the, um, the, um, the, um, the, um, the, MY career-and the Di �RI, the, the, the, the, the, the rules of the practice that one. And the third one is to sustain, to sustain the Dharma. So there's the two essences. One is Swaha, I mean to consume everything, like the Agni Tattwa, like the fire principle. And Swadha is the principle of the water which you sustain. Then, Mana. Manama and the uals. resultado es OwT willing. It means the , it's the principle of the water kal bumper. is the emotions, the center of the heart, is mana, emotions. Then janam means the people, is the collective. So I said also samih, samuhi means collective, janam, that is contact people, jana means people. Then tapasya, tapasya means penance, that is class, the word for the penance and made out of the principle of, oh I'm sorry I forgot to say that jana is made in the principle of vayu, ether. I forgot the ether. Then comes the, this is made with the vayu, means the air, the mana is made with the air, vayu, all right? And then comes the tapasya, is with the light, light. And then satya. So I have given the essences, I mean the nature, the essential nature of the chakras and also how it is created, from what essence it is created. Ling Sirak Is lessons and lessons.

What is the simple way of overcoming the fear of the light? What is the simple way of overcoming the light? What is the simple way of overcoming the light? Fear. All right? I, you go come to Me, see your, what you call, your supranah. Now in this one I will extend you in the next, let's say all about, with time, with the fear, from where you are disappointed and how you feel. What happens when awareness comes to the face and all these people are super-indulgent from the supranah to the air-power, goes on. As it's possible in all the different countries, people go with you, in general, in all. Now after seeing all that, the new generation is born also. So that is the problem. Are you aggressive? Are you aggressive? Are you trying to overpower someone? Let me tell you. So far people are super-indulgent, is the problem. First they are aggressive, they say, no, this is not in our area. So that is the problem. There is the problem. First is the area of ego, is super-indulgent, but it's just a thing. You can't be useless, you must have been sick people. You have accepted the reality, but reality is very different and very beautiful. We say, each one of you is a sick and hardest and inured. It is for all of you to get it. Nobody can certify for this, you have to certify, you have to. Now here you have first kathras, I told you, about the best innocence, is the first one. Second kathra, which you see on top, is the yellow one. In between the strings, triangular, goes in the final chord, at the end of the final chord is called the kundalini, they are called the kundalini. Now why is it called as a serpent's chord? Something. Because any chord, even in electricity moves, and they thought that this because it moves like this. It is better to call it as a serpent's chord. But it is not the power of a serpent. You see, when the adjective is used before the noun, we just do not know that the adjective becomes a noun. So once you say, you see, the power of a serpent, everything goes on. Now so the, if it is like the power of a serpent, then by three we must get it. You see, all kinds of, you can get all kinds of dancing poses and you can even take out your clothes with me, and everything can happen. Every sort of thing can happen to me, as soon as you change an adjective for the noun and you also does it. Only in religion they do like this, it's always a very good thing. But not everywhere else, you will not find it if you say, coming from anywhere else. I mean it's not, when they say, cut the top, that means it is like that. Or at least you know, it has something to do with the top. It is poisonous, it is horrid, it is, it's been heating up, it's not single, it may fail. You will be surprised that you can live it, can never harm it. You know we think that electricity can be used for books or for your family. Atomic energy can be used for good purpose or bad, but not for my job. Try, you can. If you want to kill someone who is on yoga or yoga is here, you can kill people. That's if you want somebody who is sick from that. You can try all of the Sahaja Yogis by far, if you want, you would not. But you cannot because it is divine, pure. It will be something like, say, if that, nothing so pure in the soil, but I can say if the water, you can say water, water. And people can say, no, the water doesn't need water, but you can use the same water for quality of the soil. That's it. It will work or sort of you can say that you can remove the waste. That is not the quality of divine oil. It is not. What you can do for both of us, that's why I said there is nothing so pure and particularly innate as the divine oil, which is never solid and is never, never can be used for any matter. As soon as you start thinking about something bad, why don't you stop thinking? As soon as you think of harming someone, your body will start to move. As soon as your mind goes on to some sort of a destructive plan, why don't you stop? You get something. And some you think of, like you cannot do. And if you try to do, you lose your body. It's a very important thing. So you cannot do this for any bad person. That is absolutely pure and pure. Now think how do you get to be all this? I've shown you the red one, then the yellow, then the green, then you know for the green, then the one that looks like a small and then here is the white one, this one and then on top. These seven chakras are done. And all these seven chakras, one by one, if you see in the chart, you've got the full idea about the seven chakras, the three chakras sitting on them and how they help. And what is the sympathetic term, what is the bad sympathetic, what is the left side, what is the right side of the map and what is the lower one? The lower part of the map is the hell of it. The left side of the map is the sub-part. The right side of the map is the hip part, by which the plant is the arandasic part and here is the super-part of the about the body. So the attention has to go up, up, up and breath this, that is the bacterium as you call it, breath this part and become one with that kind of feeling. This is never going to happen. Typically it will not stop and it won't happen and it will not happen. We have had people who were difficult but they are awesome. So many people have got it, so you too also have it and all over the world people are making it, so there's no harm in doing it. But if you want to make it a sort of a cheap stuff, you can, it's not. It's the most precious, it's the most linear, and there's a place for the whole world. People are such an expert of that, they take you there. They will use it for small things like this. Or should I go to this place or not, should I take a library? If you start using it for cheap things, it goes up. That awareness won't be there. For example, this machine can be used by me, can be used by this house, can be used by this. It's just this. But vibrations too. When you are connected with your spirit, they discriminate and you find it. If you try to play strictly in the beginning, all the time you will start in the beginning and then they give up. Understand it like you're going to hell. When the vibrations are flowing, it is completely, actually it is a blissful state you are in joy and you start to grow. As in your life, it is that. I've seen people who were some 50,000 years, even in the morning, they are growed up. Like you see, some people, if you don't talk to them, they say, they grow up. What do you do to them? They come. Like that, people are who are those, that is all. But after some of your life is just gone. Every moment you are in joy, if you do that, you enjoy it as a joke, if you do funny, you enjoy it as a funny. If you do slower, you put your attention on it and you keep that, you keep that. So you see, you start to become a part and part of that universal being and you start to reach, like you have a, I mean, you have a link, you have fixed up. In an instrument, it is living and it is working and you are a part of that instrument and you keep that stuff. But by thinking you cannot do it. That is one thing you must know, by thinking you cannot do it here. Because thinking is a division of a limited mind. It is a triggering. When it happens, a triggering, then suddenly God happens. Don't keep it. And you become one with that mind. You cannot do it by rationalizing. Oh, I can work it out, I can keep my thoughts alright. That's not the message. You cannot work it out. It's a living process that works out like the sprouting of the sea. It works out and it runs. And it just happens to you by itself. You cannot think about it. The more you start thinking about it, for the one thing, you cannot think about it, it just happens and you become, you become. So first what happens is you become half asleep from there. When the Kundalini rises upon that center of Adya, which is the center of God, which is placed between the pituitary and the center, which is at same in your all chart. When you talk to that, you become absolutely completely happy. But when Kundalini clears its forces, you start to feel asleep. The way it feels, you start to feel asleep. If the Kundalini has got a status or you are the Kundalini, that's something wrong, very mentally, emotionally with you, it can be something. So the Kundalini itself, but for the first time after the people feel it, you see, it is Kundalini in the one of its head. If I choose that first, let me give you an experience so that you can remember. You must remember this. So it gives you a trust, you see. But then what happens is, it comes down and flows here and there again, again. Then again it comes down. It's actually part by part and part by part. As you may think, it is absolutely pure and happy and it is the vibrational power that I am there completely happy. So why should not get upset about it? You see, those who have it over, it is the quickest and the, and the only way is the same. You have to get your instrument right. This is the problem. And unless once it's the instrumented side, nothing can work. So this is what it is. As if you have to get the realization, you have to know once that people you are afraid to participate in cannot. You have to be deep in it and realize there is no problem. And here we are, not like other people who say, come along, come along, come along, you must come along. If you come in your little place, if you come in your center, if you are really in it, rather than be at one just one, when you start just one that starts and you were saying to you that one man had arose and arrived in Kundalini and he got spoiled and started to come down from India. I said, all right, you have to decide. You have to decide, you have not been very generous. Some of the time somebody tells you that you have to deal with it. He said, I don't deal with it, I don't want to deal with it, I don't want to deal with it. Then you say, why is it too much? You better go. Why do you not waste my time and why do you not have problems? Because if you do not deal with all this, you better go. Because it is one of the things. I am selling my time for you. And if you do not want to have it, let them go. You are quite a man, can't you? You are wanting to go on and so on and so on. Then you will see that, it's not like that. If you do not cooperate, why should you cooperate? Think of it. So this is not a publicity stunt going on or any kind of a shooting for the election. Even if you have one person, it's all right. But we do not want people here just to have custody to enroll that we have been to a good shopping, we have not seen this shopping. We have stopped all that. We don't want that. This is a definite thing where it doesn't sell. It is you who are, it is you who are asking and you have to get it in your own right. That is your right. But if you want to deny your right, I am not going to call at you and say, please please, please, please. Of course I am not so hard like others are. They could be very hard, even twice. Could be hard, but again I don't want to be a small person. You see, you can sometimes surprise the way people go on and on and you inspire Me that you must do this, you must show My Father, you must show My Grandfather, you must show My Mother, you must show My great, great, great, great Grandfather, then only I can. That's why shopping goes on, you see, that's why bargain is. There is no bargain on the board. Just have it because of your right, in your own best interest, in your own dignity. In all your freedom is, I mean, you can learn, but there cannot be any bargain you have. If you try to bargain, you should have it, you should receive it. Of course there are some people now from very big cities, of course you will be very big cities, they are coming to see you just to talk about it. I tell them, I'm not a big city. I say, come and talk to people. Since you are, they want to see you, they want to talk. I say, when they come, they will come and see you. But if they are coming to tell Me a bit yesterday and give me a bit yesterday, I'm not going to see you. You see, because I know all that stuff, I see many of them and I'm not going to see them tomorrow, tomorrow, yesterday, they can go to the high park and stand on the sofa. That's the best way to go. I think this happens with many people. You see, they just come to talk. You have to see them tomorrow. I mean, but of their kind of show-off, they are not rich. And that's why you have to tell them, there, all the others, because this is not a talk. If you can give up, if you could understand, no, we are rich, we have rich. It's a blessing. When the whole thing is done, then I'll go to school and take high. I'll go to school, I'll never. Sometimes some of them call you a bit lost, I will go out of the house. But who is going to run after Hitler today? If you expect that, it is wrong. It is wrong. You have not understood. If you think it is part of the problem, the most you can find is the cleanliness. You are. I think you're not going to call at the feet, call the rely on it. If human beings say, for example, you are not except rely rich, I just want to accept the free choice. It's just the free choice. The whole world can't identify that. What does it matter to you? You can see it. How can you tell this? But if you find it human beings realize that the time has come for our father who has taken this thing to God and created all this for us and he's called us to God and to get it and whatever we want to do, let it happen. There are some other types of God also. It's not all the time it is time for them. As a mother I think, she thinks this is, we have this Irish cup. But the other side of it is a different type. So in all your beauty, in all understanding, in all your magic, you receive it. Receive it and enjoy the feeling of God. And enjoy all the power of your own being that your own, they are inside and I only give you the free. I will give you the free. And once you have it, you have the free as is all yours. Well, to your child and to the whole world. Because this is your district, if you cannot enjoy God, you have to enjoy in the comfort of your heart. You cannot enjoy God. It's so clear. You want to find some people who you want to help you go into the center. It will depend on if you are not. It happens to you. But he can't help you. He can't help you if you are a yoga, if I tell him or not because he's some sleep. If I tell him that I found him, that's me. By God's grace we have lots of people now who are not and also we are developing our comfort of heart. I'm sure we are going to have many more and then we can share with others. I also enjoy God. That is all. You are here, God. Now, in such a short time, I cannot tell you all about the couple. I have to tell you all that in a long time that you can be quite bored and out of it. It doesn't help you very much. Excellent. And if you have the will now. Now, those are the two things like this. I'm wondering if you could take it. Shoes are really big. That's why it came down on board because I found the vibration is passing through the hip. It's not. That's why it came down. So it's better to take out the shoes so that you can feel more without it. Now, this is the thought that you see. Now, I'm telling you. Take out the shoes.

1970-0101 Talk on Dharma Caxton Hall London UK R2R09 a3 DP-Opt

I'd like to begin the session by welcoming Mataji. This evening I would like to begin the session by welcoming Mataji. It's not extremely easy to introduce Sahaja Yoga in a short introductory speech, and it's even more difficult to introduce Mataji because words end where reality begins, and that's what Mataji is about. I can tell you a few things, though, and I want to speak especially to those who come here for the first time. We are a group of people in the West who have met Mataji about two years ago, and we have not been extremely, how would I say, aggressive about spreading the knowledge of what we have gained, because during these two years we mostly enjoyed, I mean, a bit egoistically, the immense privilege to be near her and to be blessed by her teachings and her attention. But basically what Mataji can grant is something which is called self-realization. You might know that self-realization is a very difficult state to achieve by oneself. It is said that it took four great sages and things, lives and lives of austere penances and efforts to eventually reach that goal. Well, the absolutely amazing, I mean fantastic fact is that Mataji does have the power to grant this state of self-realization in a matter of many and too many people at the same time. Now this is beyond understanding. I have to warn you that it can be experienced, and once the experience is done it can be better and better understood. But right away a logical, rational mind would of course say, is it possible for someone to grant realization at so much level? I know this has never happened before, but you see there is a progress and an evolution, and what was not possible before is possible today. When we met Mataji we were first overwhelmed by, I mean, actually very human qualities, but human beings don't exhibit them so much, so we kind of forgot them. But basically Mataji cares so much for everybody. And you see you can be rich or poor, young or old, I mean you can be deceased or healthy, or whatever. Mataji, when you go to her and when you seek her assistance and blessings and guidance, she will give you exactly the same amount of attention, and this attention is intense and all loving. I must say that I had gone to quite a few gurus before, and I mean that's really a major difference, because you see gurus usually look after people who have money, and they look because they can get their money, and they look after people who are young because they can get their energy. I mean, with Mataji the first relationship was for all of us, has really been the relationship with a Divine Mother, sure, but a Mother in the sense that we felt that she really does only one thing, and this is our happiness. You see, when we go into drugs and sex and, I mean, all the trips in which we have spent so much time, I mean, what are we seeking? I mean, basically we are seeking intensity. We are seeking an intensity of feeling, of sensation, of love. And there is a point where intensity and existence and joy and love and peace meet together, and this point is reached after realization. You see, what is going to happen this evening is something really extraordinary, and many of you who have come already know it. It is said that realization is a thing when the Kundalini, which is a sleeping Divine, which is a Divine energy sleeping at the bottom of your spine, raises within your spine and reaches the sahaswara. Then what happens? Then people begin feeling in their hands what has been described in the Bible as the wind of the Holy Ghost or the breath of life. This is what was described at Pentecost, and this is what Jesus Christ, Lord Jesus Christ, was talking about when he said, you have to be born again of the water and of the Spirit. The baptism of the Spirit is the wind. Now, today in London in 1978, this evening, people who never felt it will feel it. You see, when the 14th of July, when there was the French Revolution, the King of France at the time wrote in his private diary, nothing happened today. Well, it's very difficult for human beings to realize history in the making. I mean, we reflect upon history once it's finished or we project it in the future. But try this evening to realize the incredible magnitude and importance of the fact for your own life, that you are sitting in front of somebody who is going to give the fulfillment of lives and lives of spiritual quest to many of you. Those who will not feel it shouldn't bother, I mean, should not be affected. Not everybody will feel it at once. Not everybody will jump in that stage at once. But if you are genuinely seeking truth, God, who is all powerful and all loving, will lead you where you want to go. So those of you who this evening wouldn't feel it, shouldn't be upset. It will work out this time. But a few other things I should like to emphasize is, when I say we are inside the yogi, you see we are not interested in your money. This should be very clear. You see, when Mother Earth gives plants and fruit, I mean, she does it free. I mean, then the gardener comes and puts a fence around and says it's 20 trees or whatever. I mean, this is human doing. I mean, one cannot tax the air that you have to breathe in order to live, can one? In the same way, these aberrations are just priceless. And this time, between God and yourself, there won't be any rubbing man to take your birth. This is one thing. The other thing is, we are not seeking your votes either. I mean, I tell it very nicely and very friendly, that it is true. You see, what we hope is that all the genuine seekers of reality get what they are entitled to get. Because now is the time of revelation. But we don't want to build up a big organization or a big institution, or to have a big night at quarter with an elephant switchboard and brass panel on the door. We want each of you to be able to reach that condition in which you will see that to be human is a happy story. To be human is not the filth, the vulgarity, the injustice, the garbage which is in our society today. No. This is a result of our own mistakes, of our own doing. It is not God's doing. God's doing brings joy and peace and fulfillment and bliss. I mean, I can say, I can utter these words because by the grace of Matadi, I have discovered this dimension within myself, as many as other people. But what I have felt for myself, you haven't felt it maybe yet, so it is not that important. Try to be open. That's all what you can do. I mean, you cannot do anything this evening. Just be open and try to get in touch with your own goodness. That after all, you are, why not? Why shouldn't you be worthy to get this? It's a big thing, but your love is even bigger than everything we can imagine. You see, I have spoken about the wind, and I don't want to go too much in scripture. As we are in a Christian country, I should like though to speak a little bit about the wind. It has been said in the Gospels many a time that someone is going to come after Jesus Christ in order to bear witness to the truth of his teaching, in order to bring the fulfillment of all which has been said, in order to grant eternal life. This someone has been called the counselor or the confeder or the Holy Spirit. Now, there was a monk in south and fifty in the middle age, which name was Joachim de Fiore. He was saying that after the age of the father, which corresponded to the Jewish time, and the age of the son, which corresponded, of course, to the incarnational pieces, the age of the mother would come, which was the age of the Holy Spirit. These things, you cannot really accept or reject them because you don't yet have the instrument to know whether I am talking nuts or whether I am talking the truth. But you know, I mean, some of you may know that a statement, I mean, is a scientific statement when you can experiment the truth of it by experimentation. This is the first condition. The second condition is that the experiment should be communicable. So, until you can experience and until you can realize that this experience is shared by other people, what I say should be an hypothesis. And the statement that I should like to make this evening, I mean, I don't make it on my behalf. I mean, eventually I would like to talk on behalf of all those that have been blessed by meeting Mataji, all the Sahaja Yogis of all over the world. People who have been blessed to meet this unique, really absolutely unique and genuine personality. And I would like to say that the One who is the supreme power, the One who is the power of God, the Almighty, the One who is the power beyond all powers, the One who is the Holy Spirit, has incarnated in the human form of the Divine Mother, Mataji Nirmala Devi. What I am saying, I am telling it to you this evening and we will tell it to the nation of the earth. You can't digest, I know, you can't let be open. This is a hypothesis for the time being. If you feel this evening today is coming in your hands, which is what has been said in the Bible to be the sign of the Holy Spirit, then you will understand that something very big is happening in the world today. You will understand that you are blessed to have been called at the beginning of a tremendous historic process. You will understand why the Golden Age is now open to us. I mean, all this is very big and I always tend to be a bit sore, I mean, a bit too pompous maybe. But, I mean, actually, Sahaja Yoga is very happy, very joyous and we have a lot of fun and we laugh a lot. But this is just not the time to, this is not the time to deceive you. I have to tell you what things are. You see, if you can't take it, that's too bad, but that's the way things are. It is really this. I'm very, very happy this evening by the grace of God. Those who are the seekers of him. Those who are not seeking the junk of the spiritual circle, but those who are seeking reality, they will get the blessing by the grace of Mataji. May God bless all of us. May God bless all of us. I know it is a proclamation. Even when about Christ it was prophesied, how many believed Him. It's a very sad story. But there's no use bothering about Me, who I am, who am I, what am I going to do to you. It's high time you bother about yourself and find out something for which you are born, for which you are created. From the amoeba stage we have been brought to this human level with great care for so many years. Why the Divine? If you believe in Divine or not, is not the point. But I will call it Divine, you can call it anything, nature, whatever you feel like. Why did it create human beings? Have we reached that point where all our conclusions are over? Do we understand why we are existing? What is the purpose of this evolution? Why so many scriptures were written and so many incarnations, if you believe in them, came on this earth? Is there any meaning to them and to us? Are we related to them or not? Those who are not here realized, I think at least all the Sahaja Yogis do not come to this side, believe. They come to My private session no more. But at least twenty-five percent are here who have got realization. You have to have your Self-realization, it is in your own right. You have to get your fulfillment, you have to find it. It is your birthright as a human being. As an animal we do not get these problems as you have of people. We are not bothered. Animals eat their food, live in this world and are not bothered even about insurance of their life. Leave alone your thinking. The problem starts when we raise our heads, when we become human beings. A new style of personality develops in a human being alone and that personality has, which many of you if they are psychologists know, is covered with ego and superego as shown in the figure. On both sides of our heads we develop this ego and superego. And this ego and superego gives us this I-ness. I am someone, you are someone, they are someone. This gives you the freedom which was promised, it was granted and whatever is granted is not going to be taken away. Freedom to understand what is righteous, what is right and what is wrong. Of course throughout in the history of our evolution we have been helped even when we became human beings by the unconscious, by the universal unconscious which comes to us in our dreams and gives us symbols, controls us, by frightening us sometimes, harmonizes us by giving us a picture. It has been working to help us and guide us. The Divine never left us alone, we cannot blame the Divine. But most remarkable thing is that when a person like Freud and Jung came on this earth people accepted Freud and never Jung. They do not know who is this man Jung is. In this whole of London there are only eleven Jungians living. What did we choose? Freud who had a very limited vision of the reality, who had himself a very perverted life, but that we accepted because it went more with our brain which was in our past. We accepted it because we thought this was the thing that was really the joy giving thing and the way he says that these are inhibitions and you must liberate yourself and the idea of liberty of this kind appeared to us much more. We forgot all the scriptures, we forgot Christ, we forgot everyone and we accepted who was Freud. We did not even bother to find out what kind of a life this fellow was that we do. He was one of the unhappiest man you could think of. At the end of his life he suffered from a terrible type of cancer which was a combination of two and he suffered from the cancer of the jaw, his face was darkened with it and part by part his body was removed. But he becomes our hero suddenly without even understanding or relating to his own life what kind of a life was he living. It's more surprising. Human beings when they are given their freedom the way they choose, supposing you find by going in this way you get completely void and this way you are glorified. How is it that you take to that where you clearly see that this is a ruinous life? I have known of many gurus suffering from terrible diabetes, of heart troubles, all kinds of problems. At least physically you can see how they are. Despite that we close our eyes and follow them blindly. Why? Like all the facts that came, like waves one after another we accepted them without even thinking what it has rendered to the followers. That's not human nature though, that's not mutual. That by no means is the intelligence of human beings to know even if there is one bee left they will go all the way to Birmingham to purchase their bread. That's the place where we feel. That's the place we neglected. The reality came to you many a times on this earth. You never accepted that but now the time has come for you to take it or destroy it. And how can you pay for it? When rigor says that there is no relationship of money I would say it's insulting to say for the day that you can pay for My love. It insults My being. How can you pay for love? Think of it. Can you pay for the love of your Mother? This is also a human ego which says we can purchase everything, we can even purchase God, we can even purchase Christ, we can even purchase guru too. That's the reason why here to take a hunter in his hand and beat people, horizons, for this kind of funny idea that you can purchase God. It is not a clubbing. I used to feel it is a clubbing of the same style of people together that they are treating each other and treating themselves and are very happy. It is not. But they take to easier ways. It appeals to the masses and not to the way that gives them a strength in their own personality because they see strength in the personality of the masses and not in the personality of themselves. What has Freud given to your personality? Idiosity and stupidity. We are not bothered to find out where are we in relation to ourselves when we proceed on some lines or proceed on some understandings. And that is why there has been big mistake, very big mistake and you have spoiled your path of evolution. You have rained your chakras by these mistakes. And when the time has come to sow the seed what do I find? When it has to sprout what I find is that seed is hurt at that point. The edge when it is to be reborn is already injected with something else. What does a person like Me should feel? It's no question of money. Money is something, not even the dust of his feet. Money is our own conception of foolish conception. It is not the question of any organization, these human organizations rise and fall like that. You have seen Roman Empire came up and fell. All these kings come up and fall down. It's not that. It is the question of the entire human evolution. Humanity has to evolve itself and there is a system, a certain system existing in you which has been so many times described even in the Bible. Do the people at that time were such fools and such stupid people and such blind that I will appear before you like tongues of faith. But this divine power was to be kept properly lit and properly agnostic. This was very important that this divine blessing that you have in the triangular bone placed there in three and a half world is the holy fire, is to be placed there in the most holy manner that your Mother born again and again with you, again and again. She is born when you are born. She comes and resides there. She is your memory. She records everything that you have done, whether it is painful to her or whether it is joyous to her, everything is recorded by her. And she exists there throughout to guide you. And here in this world what I find is people have played with Kundalini itself, I have one, is to place Kundalini like a prostitute who is your own mother. What more thing can we do? There is no end to satanic thinking. You have been given freedom but not to choose the satanic realm, to choose the Divine. How can your mother be your prostitute? Kundalini is your mother because She gives you your Divine rebirth. But people, the tantricas, so-called tantricas because tantrum is mechanism and if there is anybody who is a tantric, the one who knows about tantra, is a Sahaja yogi. But the so-called tantricas as they call themselves, those who have got no knowledge about Kundalini have written such big books. Now you can see yourself, where is the Kundalini? How She rises, how She pulsates, you can see with your own eyes. If you read Marta Leya, if you read Adi Shankaracharya, you will know they have described this age, this time. But it is for you people to see for yourself with your own eyes, if it is the truth, if you are really speaking the truth, then you must keep yourself open and see for yourself. Do not identify yourself with the mistakes you have committed. Today's subject, you see I have been speaking for now five, six lectures, today's subject they have chosen for Me as the dharma and Kundalini. The word dharma or religion that you call, dharma means the sustenance power. Dharma in Sanskrit means dharayati sadharma, the one who sustains. Whatever we sustain is our dharma. A human being has his own sustaining power, carbon has four valencies, gold has its own capacity that it is not untarnishable. In the same way a human being has got his own sustaining power within himself. So first the sustenance is very important before you jump into something. For example if I have to come to Caxton Hall, the road to Caxton Hall is very important. But once I come into the hall here that may not be equally important but exists and that's why should be respected. From the time of Moses there has been the talk of dharma, of sustenance. There is nothing to doubt what he has said about the Ten Commandments. These Ten Commandments are nothing but the sustaining power in our navel, what we call the Nabhi chakra, are the ten subluxuses they have placed. Or you can call the ten petals of that lotus, at the Nabhi chakra. This is the third chakra within us. It has got ten subluxuses and is represented or manifested in the growth as solar plexus. In the subtle form it is a very important chakra because that is the beginning of our evolution. Our evolutionary processes we start from the navel, from the navel. The sustenance of a human being makes him a human being. Not his clothes, not his money, not his position but the personality as you can call it, nearest to the point. A human personality are these ten points, he must have minimum of them. If he does not have he is not a human being, he is a satanic person. Or he is subnormal, he is a beast, he is an arid. All these sustaining powers we have got through various methods and through various sources. So many of My disciples here have been hippies before. Real hippies I mean in the real sense of the word. They were just drug addicts living in fixed time. They thought by doing that they had achieved God and renounced the materialism of the world. Great personalities they thought they were. This is most misleading. What is there to give up in this world if you do not possess anything? It's just the snow of giving up. This is what you are treating yourself by saying we have given up this and we have given up that. If we do not own anything it's like My thing I have given up the cat's horn. It does not belong to Me and it does not even belong to anyone because it is only in the registration office. When we die we do not take any part of it. First I am taking the cases of our hippies because they are a very important part of this one. I would say they were the sages, the saints who were speaking really I know that they were the saints. It was described in the Puranas that once Nala met this Kali, this modern time he is known as Kali Yuga. And he was very angry with Kali because he had separated his wife from him. And he said, now I have got you in my hands and I am going to finish you off with Kali Yuga this modern time. He is the one who has created this modern time, is the deity known as Kali. He is described in the Puranas what will happen, the women will wear the dresses of men and all that. In very great detail he will be surprised that people will be eating food out of plastics and tenless feed also. So he caught hold of this Kali and he said come along now I am going to destroy you. So Kali said alright you can destroy me but please listen to my importance Mahatma. Listen to my importance. He said what is your importance the most horrible person who creates such a horrible age of confusion? He said that in those times only when I will be the ruling person, I will be known as Kali, the one who has created this Kali Yuga at that time only. The saints who are sitting in India in the valleys and the mountains will get their realisation. That's the time of greatest confusion and the greatest confusion. So Nala forgot his problems and he forgave me and he said alright you go ahead with your plan. And so in this Kali Yuga only such great saints were born and are born again and again but they were not realised too. They were seekers. When you realise you do not seek, your seeking is over. And they were taken up by the fact. The idea of giving up because materialism bore them too. Came into their mind but without understanding where they are going they jumped into one big, big. Others were caught up by these gurus mostly in the cities. Gurus have no interest in the villages thank God for that. They are interested in your purse, your money and dominance. But there are some such botanic ones that they are interested in spreading all the chances of your evolution. The propagating first thing that you may not have your evolution all your lives and they will go to hell and with them they are going to carry you to hell. This is a very subtle of attack on the saints. A very subtle type of attack on the saints. Who are really seeking God with true heart. May God bless all of them and give them what they have been asking for. So that's how we have been spoiling our dharma. I need not tell you about ten commandments, you know that. Because most of you know about ten commandments, that's why I'm telling you. But even in the Indian scriptures or Koran or anywhere these ten commandments are repeated by all the real gurus. Not the fake and the false. All the real gurus, they are mainly ten of them. One of them is Moses. The last one came in India as Sainath, not this another fellow who calls himself Truthfully Sainath. If you are Sainath why should you say truthfully I am God? There are many like that. These are all satanic. They have come on this earth to spoil your dharma. One of them was Freud. Another was Hitler who disturbed you so much to such an extent that people of that age lost all the values of sustenance of their dharma. Now in the Bible whatever is written cannot be understand unless and until you are realized many things in the same way about Buddha and all other things. For example it is written that you will not engraven me. Anything that is in the heaven or on the earth or under the water, any image cannot be engraven. Whichever is in the heaven, that means there is. Whichever is on this earth, that means there is. And whichever is earth, under the water. It means that you cannot create the image yourself. It is already been created. You must have heard that in India there are some places where they say they call it a swambu idol. Means it has come out of the mother earth. Now those who are Sahaja Yogis here who have been to India have felt the vibrations coming from these things. There are some places here like Stonehenge which is definitely a vibrated place. There is another place I would say which is very famous are the pyramids. I went to the pyramids and they are just vibrated. Was created by some realized soul there who gave them those ideas. But unless and until you are realized and you have those vibrations to test and find out what is the reality, how are you to know. On the contrary, if you buy something in the market and bring that image. Today only we had a lady who had bought a statue of Divine Mother from India and had brought it and was worshipping. And she had the same chakra caught up where that jagann matha or we call jagadambali is the heart chakra. And she was suffering from the same trouble which if she is enlightened she can be cured. That is at the heart center. And this lady did not know. She thought she was a religious woman. I said, from where did you buy that? She said, I bought it from a very good saint. I said, how could you buy an image? It's not a business. For human beings they cannot understand anything without business. The other day we had a boy, he telephoned to find out what is the catch. If there are false and fake people it means there has to be reality somewhere. If there is relative something then you must know there has to be an absolute something. That's how the copies are made. But we are so much made, our value structure is so made that we cannot understand, we cannot understand that God is beyond us. We cannot understand that if we have to reach Him we cannot read about Him. By reading books you cannot reach Him. You have to feel Him. It has to be worked out in you. It's a living process has to happen. Like a small seed sprouting itself. The holy seed within you has to sprout by itself spontaneously. That is what is the Haja, Sahaja, Swami, which is born. It is born with you, the holy seed is placed and you have to get your realization by the sprouting of this seed. That is being promised and has to happen. But in the meanwhile we have spoiled the Dharma, the sustainer of our seed. When we say religion, immediately we think of Christianity or Hinduism and Islam and all those things. There also we do not think of the incarnations who came and who started it. But we think of the organizations and the theological colleges from where they are giving certificates, here by you are certified to baptize. And we seriously go and bow our heads to them, all right baptize me. What authority have they got to baptize? Who has given them authority to baptize? Did we ever challenge and ask them? We prostrate before all these false people headlong without even questioning. And finding out what others are doing, those who surround Him what are they doing? How can we organize God? He has His own organization, He has His own organizers and He organizes everything in His own way, not by your decay. Please remember He is God Almighty. He has all the power to do whatever He likes, but there is one power that He has given you, it's your own freedom. And that power He wants never to be taken back. But we run to people who are enticing. We like enticements, we like circus. We like all that is supposed to be. Why not we ask for our own power, whether you go to churches or to hippies or to any guru? It has been promised that your own self will be manifesting the power. For example, Gregor who was here or many like him who are and thousands who are supposed to be Most of them they are realized and they are. They can give awakening of the Kundalini, they can give realization. Many of My disciples have cured a disease which is known as cancer. Cancer can only be cured when you get your evolution, otherwise it cannot be cured. And all those gurus will have to die of cancer. They have taken the money, all right, have it. The way they have committed sin is to kill all the possibilities of your evolution for little money, such debasement of themselves and of you. I cannot understand why should you accept. Anyone as your guru, as your guru means a higher person, who lives on your money. Will anyone of you accept to live on My money? That means they are even worse than us terrified. They are beggars. A man who is holy is like a king. He doesn't bother. If you are here two or three or ten or fifteen, it's not My concern. Holiness can be felt. Even if he should be understood, if your dharma is all right, if your sustenance is all right, but it is not. We have become very close. But we say we are tired of materialism, we do not want, because we read some books written by somebody somewhere, that you see this is all materialism, this is this, this is this. And by reading books we think, oh, we are very satisfied people, we are very good people, and we are going to give up materialism. You do not. By saying these things you do not. Take yourself in reality. When you are trying to protect some identifications which are really misidentifications, must know that you are being treated, you are being thoroughly treated, and you are going on those lines of treatment. Your dharma has been ruined. You have not achieved your bliss and joy. Since it's clearness. So it has been promised after all. God has promised that He will give up. Are we prepared to receive? Are we willing to have it? Yes. You are willing to have, no doubt. But it has to be the way God wants, not the way you want. For example, if you have disturbed your sustained dharma, adults see it's a point. Christ had said that even to have adulterous eyes, not a word that He said is wrong. Not a word that He has said was false. Even if you have adulterous eyes, you will be losing your dharma, which is a fact. The statistics of impotency has come. The statistics of impotency has come. Such a limit if you read and find out that in the Western countries impotency is settling down very fast. Why? You talk so much of sex. You talk and read and pray and as if that is such a great job to be done, it is done just like that by animals. Thou shall not commit adultery. It means without marriage you are not going to have relationships with anybody else. Now you may say marriage is a ritual. It is not. It is the concession or you can say the certificate of the universal unconscious when it is so many people. Feel so happy when a wedding takes place. Everyone is happy. It's such a beautiful thing the whole society feels. And why? Because they expect a new net has been built, children will be born in that. A new generation will be coming, our species will be saved. But for human beings it is a question of the mind. Our species will be saved. But for human beings it is extremely important they must respect themselves to the will. Those who have no self-respect, those who do not understand what they are trickering away just to please their base ourselves cannot get their realisation. Ours is a different stock. In other shops you'll find come along, come along, come along, bring your purchase, bring your friends, everybody come along. In this shop you have to know that you have to get it and get it and get it. That's all. There is no argument about it, there is no lecturing about it, there is no brainwashing, nothing. You have to feel the vibrations and you have to use it and see for yourself that these works work out. Like a machine you are, I can say, like a computer you are, built in, everything built in. The Kundalini is placed within you, you can see with your naked eyes the pulsation of the Kundalini. You can feel it, the movement of the Kundalini. You can feel that when it reaches over Agnya chakra you can feel the thoughtless awareness and when it jumps out of your soul's Rana you can feel that you start emitting vibrations, the spirit from the heart manifests there. You can see that immediately you become collectively conscious. You can start feeling the vibrations of another and you can then find out what's the matter with another person through your fingers which of course doctors accept that there is sympathetic, there is sympathetic activity and one can feel the chakras on their fingers. Which are the chakras? What chakras describe which part? Which chakra means your Navi, which means your Agnya, which means your Vishuddhi, which are the devi seeking on these and what mantas are to be used, all this has to be told to you. Somebody has to tell you. The unconscious has to tell you. It has tried too many ways of giving you dreams and symbols but when it has been found out that nobody receives any attention, when you have described it so clearly to the whole of press, can you imagine there are only inner reunions in this great country of reflection and so many mad caps. You can see them in Oxford surface or something. Sanity is so rare without the incarnation it was not possible. How to tell it? Now you see for yourself the record is established or not. You see for yourself and find out. Is there any path? Can we talk to the divine? Yes. The vibrations will tell you. They will tell you means and everything. You have to be little bit, little bit stabilized to take little time for somebody but for some it doesn't take time at all. They are just there absolutely there. Now these people who have felt it are because you believe in the power and you believe in somebody who is highly pleased, I would like to say, the one who has felt it is, there is one gentleman from India who is highest, highest of some place and that is the one who is working now as the judge in the high court of state, the world high court. He has got it. The Chief Justice of Bombay has got it. There is one Mr. Vaidya who is a justice, he has got it. The justice, Chief Justice of Calcutta High Court has got it. But they do not brack us, they do not wear something to show we are Mataji disciples. Nothing, it is inside, everything inside, nothing outside. You may write to them and find out if they have got it or not. You may write even to the President of India who was given it. Of course he went for his operation to America but when he came back he called me at the airport here, he was very, with his vibrations he was completely cured and when he got down at Bombay he just walked off. He had walked into the plane with very great difficulty on his face. This is only because human mind is stuck. They won't understand Christ because he was poor. They understand a guru who goes in a Christ class, can't be like a guru going in a Christ class. I cannot understand Christ too. How do they expect their gurus to be like that? Of course if I am placed in a high, big family, if I have money, all right. If I do not have, I am not going to live on any means of my vibrations. This is the fundamental thing one must understand and secondly that these things are about the Holy Spirit, about the holiness, the whole of Ten Commandments are about your holy, how to keep yourself clean and in the central part of Sushumna Aishwarya, neither to the left nor to the right. Left side is for indulgence and right side is extreme abstinence. Christ did not marry of course but there is a reason for it. He lived till only thirty-two years of age when he died. But all other incarnations were married and they had children. Did they miss their incarnation because they lived in the center? On the contrary if you know some Sanskrit, if you read Valmiki Ramayana, you will be surprised that Sita has said about these so abstinence people and Kanyasis who go about, he said that let them not enter into any village in the night. They can come just to beg and get them out and put them at such a place that no married woman should see them. He said it because Ramana Himself came in that dress to deceive. To extremes when we go we lose our dharma, this way or that way. For example the spiritualist church and the Pentecostals and all these who are being just possessed by spiritual. All these are on the left and the right are the people so called, so called. Who are full of abstinence and temper. They are not for our salvation. They cannot give us salvation. They cannot think of Kalyana which is salvation. They are hot tempered. They are boring. They are useless. They have no self-interest. They have no privacy of their own. They do not understand the decency because they have no privacy. This type of extreme behavior in life, going too far to the right or to the left creates a problem for your religion. Indulging too much into alcohol and some of the of course drugs take you to the right to your supratantra. But some of them take you to the left. They give hallucination. You know that the pineal body in the head which is in the center of the brain is now being destroyed. This is the first time war that is created or is produced. A chemical which is called as turaleen or something like that, which if analyzed creates two other chemicals, one of them is LSD. When you take LSD, that chakra which is governed by sweeteners goes into action and you are thrown onto your supraconscious on the right hand side into the collective supraconscious. If you can see on the right hand side it is there. When you go into the collective supraconscious, you behave as if you are in a trance. You start seeing hallucination, you start seeing colors, you start seeing auras. This is the right hand side. We had the other day one gentleman who started seeing tremendous auras and light from My body and this and that and he was amazed when I said, You shouldn't see that. That's not necessary. You should see Me as I am. You have to come to the present now at this moment whatever we are. You have to accept the present, neither the future on the right and neither the past on the right. Dharma gives you the balance, the harmony. It gives you the idea as to where you should be. Now because of ego development man has started experimenting, getting into such terrible areas which even they will still be afraid of. Through their mental activity by reading books, their ego gets this sort of challenge. Let me try this, let me try that. And they think we'll be innocent after all, whatever we do is just a crime, it is never so. It accepts you, it accepts your Kundalini. Among thousands we can find out a person who is Dharma is quite because he is not getting his vibrations stopped. Even the God who was before you, He didn't tell you that, then He can in this He came to Me. Too much of mental activity, too much of reading, though He is a great seeker, I must say He is a very great seeker. But to try experiments He has also taken drama, He has done all kinds of things, He has been to all the gurus and He has had prasada, the inflection or we say the infection from all of them. And He knew all of them, He has gone through all that hell and then He came to Me. He came to Me, He came to Me, because He was a true seeker, one thing I must say. He is writing a book now and you'll be surprised, it's incredible the way He has been seeking because He found out in every reading that this was not so, this was not so. This is not, this is not, this is not. And then you come to reality and stand there, no this was not. But when you come before the reality you are hurt, you are wounded, you are not yet that what you should be. That is because your dharma is point. These ten principles of our sustenance is point. Because of that it's difficult. Even you get your realization like a shark, so many have got it. So many of them have got it. Here sitting down you can ask them, they'll tell you, where you can go, there. He just laughed out when He got it. It is there but there's one thing happens to so many of you that Kundalini touches that point, you get the vibrations, you feel absolutely blissful with many, because it must give you the experience. But then the Kundalini comes back and arranges itself and supplies. You can see with your eyes. You can see that Kundalini is going in one place and pulsating. You can see with your eyes. If this pulsating in a portion say near the liver and you ask the person, are you a liver patient? He said, yes I am. As a by-product you get cured. That's what Christ did. As a by-product of the parasympathetic control, you see the parasympathetic control in the center which we call as the Sushumna, that your sympathetic on both the sides, these two get completely neutralized and the sickness cools down because you get into balance. People just don't believe in balance. Now we had a little boy who was sick with diabetes. Diabetes is absolutely curable if you know how to balance. But people do not think of balance. Those who think too much, read too much, plan too much are doing it with this Swadhisthana Chakra, which is down below there. And also the liver is looked after by that. Also the kidney is looked after by that. And when a person suffers from diabetes, he must know that he has to sit down and go into some emotional life of a holy nation. When these things happen, it is not an individualist's effort. No. It has to be a mask. In the modern times, unless and until it is a mask, there cannot be a rapport between me and you. One person getting it, nobody believes it. He was born on the tenth story or I was born there. They crucified him, finished him, poisoned him, nobody listened to him. When he died, they made his temple, his churches and all that. And then they said, all right, this is very good because we can handle him better after this. But the false people, the false people can manage it because they can just entice you, they can just put something into your head and you are just giving it to them. But reality will say, see to reality. Find it out yourself if you haven't got it, you haven't got it, whether you like it or not. If there is any condition, if there is any catch in Sahaja Yoga, it is that you have to get it and you have to get it. Without that it cannot be done. Nobody can certify false people. It is you who has to certify, it is you who has to feel it and if you do not feel it, know that you have not been able to do it because of certain problems in the chakras. Maybe you are sick, maybe there is something wrong with your relationship with your parents, maybe something is wrong with your relationship with women, maybe something is wrong with your own relationship with yourself, maybe you are a self destroying personality, like taking drugs and alcohol and all the time running away from reality. But doesn't matter, God is the ocean of compassion. He is the ocean of mercy and grace and He grants you, He has to. If His creation has to live, He has to give you, despite the fact you have walked with your dharma. And one has to remember that all the incarnations who came on this earth, say whether it was Dhoraster or Nanaka or whether it was Mohammed Sahib, all of them have a meaning within us and they are built in ourselves and specially on this chakra which I am describing above, the Nabhi chakra or you call the navel, all these ten gurus, the special ten gurus who came from the incarnation of the first primordial gurus, most of them were married men and had children. There were noble people and all of them suffered. All of them had to go through hell but they never gave up their truth and they always told the truth, guided the people and put them on the right path. These are the real gurus that they did not want to please the people. And just to take votes from them they were not contesting any election. And all these gurus are within yourself. You'll be amazed how much they are there. For example I had a Muslim boy who came to see me and he was suffering from cancer. So I told him, He said, He said, I said, And if you have to believe that way, if you believe that only Islam could cure you or only Christianity can cure you, that you cannot be alright. He said, I said, He was the same personality and how dare you differentiate out of your ignorance. Will you accept nanaka as his guru? He said, No Mother I cannot. As my guru I cannot. He went back and he had to come back again to get cured. Now we have many Muslims also among us who have felt the reality has broken their orthodoxy of this is the only one. This is a very important point that all of them are there and all these organizers and deities are different aspects of one God. After all we are human beings. We say I am one, alright, but I have eyes, I have hands, I have different aspects. I am a wife, I am a mother, I am a doctor. In the same way God has different aspects. We think that is a rock of Gibraltar somewhere that He doesn't move at all. He doesn't have any other aspects such as solidified stuff. Even rock of Gibraltar has got many layers. I cannot find any proper simile to show what people think of God to be one. All these are within you. It is for you to open your head and see for yourself. There is no organization, there is no no prestige issue involved here. It is question of your well-being. Those who think they are very great can have their own satisfaction and go ahead. We have nothing to quarrel with them but those who still think they have to seek and have it will have it. We are not interested in people those who think they are great people or they have found something or they belong to some organization something like that. We have no place, neither interest for such people. Neither we want to have anything to do with them. Let them have their satisfaction, let them do whatever they like. We have done our duty to tell you the truth. If you think you have found out, you are welcome. If you think you have to have it, you are welcome. May God bless all of you, all of you that with some total of religion is wisdom. In you there should be wisdom. You develop wisdom through proper balancing within yourself by understanding that when somebody has said it, don't do it, there must be something about it. And even you have done it. Forgiveness is the quality of God. He forgives you. He forgives only thing that you have to say, Oh Lord, forgive me, I did it, in all ignorance. That's all it works out. You are here to get what you are, to know yourself. You are here to feel your own powers and not mine. You have to have your own powers which are within you and you have to get it and not any guru-dam or anything here, but a mother is only interested in seeing her children going into something great, her children coming up. So I have to request you that take interest in yourself and not in anything where you have been wasting your time so far. Please do not waste your time anymore as a mother I am requesting you and get to the right path. Now how kundalini rises, how it works out, how it gets into it is another question. The thing is there is a science, there is a big organization. For even lighting this light, though you can press the button, there is a big organization and electricity producing mechanism and a big history behind it which found out this electricity. If you see even this small point of pressing the button there is a big thing behind it. The kundalini rises, how it works out and how it helps you is not today's subject about which I have told you in my last lecture. In any case, again I will tell you all about everything, each and everything, all the secrets can be revealed but only to a person who wants to know, who is really there, who wants to know and who wants to take it. And there are so many here who within two years time have matured so much, they are understanding such a lot and they are doing such a lot. Their lives are changed into blossoms, into beautiful flowers and they are enjoying their lives. You have to also know that you are joy. You are joy, you have to just get to it and the seed is with you. Only thing what I do is to turn it for you or to show you how to turn it. Maybe I can say I am like a gardener which pours water of love on the seeds and the seed by itself, by its own right rises and the garden seeds the flowers and it's very happy. May God bless all of you and I hope you all go into meditation for about ten minutes and you'll have the results very soon. In this process there is no outward gesticulation, no outward any show of any kind. It's a very simple happening which happens to you and if you are really in the center, if your sushumna is clear cut, I would say the best I would give an example of Justice White. He was just sitting before Me like this, he has taped it all back and just on his hand he felt something melt him and he's got it. In the same way you won't even feel the rising like a smooth cake off. The best instrument you'll do but some people who have some obstruction may feel a little obstruction or a little heat, nothing unbearable, so far nothing has gone wrong. But I've seen that people say, like the other day I told you somebody was sitting with both the feet towards Me and I said, why are you sitting like this? He said, no, My Guru has said when the Kundalini rises you start jumping like a frog. So I told him, for God's sake you better keep your Guru outside as you have put your shoes outside, otherwise you don't come to My problem. It's a very majestic thing, it's a very self-respecting and a respectability. It rises like a crane, a thing and gives you that what He has been trying to give you to us. There's no cheapness about it. There is no vulgarity to be entering into the Kingdom of God. Do you think it will be something less than majestic? It's the most beautiful thing that can happen to us and should happen to us. Let us now open ourselves together and if it doesn't happen it's all right, next time I'll eat it. I'm willing to work hard. You know I've worked very hard, these boys can tell you day and night and I've worked hard, very hard and many have got it in this country. I'm so happy I'm in London because I find in London people are really very much balanced. There's some sort of a force which I know already is there, which has worked that people are balanced. There's some sort of a limiting force which makes them understand that they have to be in the centre and so many of them I've met here are really very beautiful people. But outwardly you can only see the shine on their face, a glow on their face but inside they can feel your vibrations and they will know what the matter is. They will immediately find out what's the problem is. So please those who think they have already thought and found out are at liberty to go. I'm not here to give you lectures or give you some mental feats and to give you a brainwash. No. You have to get your Realisation otherwise I have nothing to do with you. That's what I'm here for. Luckily my husband got elected and he had to come to London and that's how I'm here. Because the other day somebody said people say that if she saw why did she come to London. Now my husband is posted here, I find and he too got elected by ninety three countries and I had to come here. It was not because I came here to earn any living for myself. So this doubt also there is some people are having in their mind should get it out. I gave you because you wanted it. Because there was a force, it's worked it out. That's why I'm here at your disposal and at yourself. May God bless you all. Again and again I bless you with all my heart that God should give you wisdom to choose the path of reality and work in His kingdom. Thank you.

1977-0221 Talk New Delhi India R2R06 a1 DP-Opt

This is a recording of the advice given by Holiness Mataji Nirmala Devi on 21st February 1977 at New Delhi. Should I tell you now about Krishna's Sahaja Yoga? Krishna tried his Sahaja Yoga at the time when he was in Gokul and Vrindavan. He chose people who were married people, sanctified, wholly married couples. You know them, they are gop and gopis living in Gokul and Vrindavan. Very simple people leading a very simple Sahaja Yoga. And these people would not come like you, they were not intellectuals, they would not ask questions, very simple village folk. Some of you may be from there or here, back again. So Krishna tried very simple methods of Sahaja Yoga. What he did? When Radha ji, ra means energy, dha means dharaiti, sa means the one who sustains energy. She is the Mahalakshmi, she becomes, she becomes many, she later on became as many. Radha. Radha ji is Adi Shakti herself. And Radha ji whenever she used to go to the Yamuna river she would vibrate the water. You have seen I am vibrating water for you. The vibrated water was carried by the gopis on their head. As a child Krishna would throw a stone from the back so the vibrated water would fall on the Kundalini and would excite the jumping. So he did the Gopala kala as you know that, how he played it with children. Actually one American told me he was with Krishna and when he got his realization he started describing his experience. And he didn't know Krishna or anybody because he was from Toledo. He was saying a bright boy and there was a butter and all that he described to us. His name is Mr. Lord Joseph. Mr. Joseph Lord. He is an engineer now in Toledo. He told me that he saw himself with so many young boys and there was a bright one, dark complexion and how he broke a matka and all those things he told me. Of course in his own way, in an American way he told me that it was hanging through a net. And there was an earthen pot which was broken. So what Krishna did was to get the small children together of his age and he made them sit one after another and standing on top of the head means his feet were touching their sastra. And that is how he wanted to awaken their Kundalini. Now I can put my hand on your sastra, you don't mind. But that's how he tried the tricks is to awaken their Kundalini through their sastra by standing on top of them. And then he broke that earthen pot, matka, through which the vibrated things fell on them and they got realization. It's baptism. It's simple baptism. He did it in a very childlike manner. Then Ra, sir. He played Ra. Ra is energy again, sir means Sahit. With energy. He did ask them to hold their hands. Now if he hold our hands you can feel my vibrations passing through you. And he used to make them hold their hands and pass his vibrations through them. And that's how he tried to awaken their Kundalini. There are so many ways, you see, it's all childlike place. When he found that their Nabhi chakra was caught, what he used to do is to commit some sort of mischief, you see. So mother would get very angry, yeshoda, would get very angry and tie all of them together with her sari around a pillar. And with that thing he used to pass his Nabhi chakra on to everyone. You see everybody tied at the Nabhi chakra and the solar plexus used to get excited because of his solar plexus. So in all his childlike play as you think is a very simple thing, is not? It is all sahaja. He played with the gopa and gopi and that's how he did it. Today is the day when we can have a pen doll, you are sitting before Me with your hands like this. But it is a very difficult thing to get such people around and make them sit in those eight times. So he tried all these beautiful tricks. They say that when he was about four years of age the ladies had gone for bath and he hid their clothes. Many people are using, you see, there was one man, he is making women naked and men naked and they dance. So he says that, I am a Krishna, I am Shri Krishna, that's why I am doing it. So I went and asked him at what age Krishna did it, at the age of four years. At the age of four years any child doesn't understand what is sex. He is a child, he doesn't understand about sex. So he was a child. If he did not care for the chastity of women or for the lajja of the women then why did he supply saris to Draupadi? Tursi Dasa has described it very beautifully. He says, when she said Krishna, she would not say Kri, she said Kri, you see, because if you hold it like this, sari, you said Kri. But then she thought it's not working or she said Krishna when she dropped. Then he, Tursi Dasa has described that moment beautifully. is, Dvarikame Shoraga, yo Shorabhayo bhare, shankhachakra gada padmas, garuda lai siddharai, everything he brought it round to save this chastity of his sister. Why? If he had no sense of chastity. In every event of his life is Sahaja Yoga. So those who say that I am like a Krishna they must understand. All, everything is Sahaja Yoga. Sixteen thousand wives is nothing but his sixteenth battle and the thousand nerves here. So sixteen thousand wives means sixteen thousand, sixteen thousand energies were created by him. And these women you know were under the domination of kings and they had no place in life so he brought them round and put those sixteen thousand energies through them. Now I need sixteen thousand children. Can I have them? This is all Sahaja Yoga. All his life is nothing but Sahaja Yoga. Ayamaza abhayana samanve Krishna ko. Apto hatha hai sakar ke betu kamse kamite hai, kuch hai paar ho ja. So it's all right. No, no, there is no lecture needed at all. Even by seeing me the Kundalini rises, at my feet it rises. Lecture is only your mental feet. Of course with my lecture maybe you get vibrated all right. But main thing is you must get realization you can get it just like that. Some people just entering inside get it. Depends on. I've told you two instances of a very well known people in India who have got it just like that. And they have got it, they have never lost it. And they have risen also very high in life. So should we get into meditation now for about, let us try for about fifteen, twenty minutes, well and good. And if it doesn't work out also don't get disappointed. There are so many ways of working it out. Take out your socks because I'm sorry it's cold but you have to take out your socks because

1978-0112 Public Program Mumbai India R2R07 b4 DP-Opt

This is a recording of the advice given by Holiness Mataji Nirmala Devi on 12th January 1978 at CJ hall. Yesterday I spoke in our national language but today they have requested me that I should speak in English. So I hope you'll excuse me for using this foreign language. It is very difficult to describe the experiences of the Spirit in this language. You'll be amazed to know that in this country, right from the language, everything has been discovered through meditation. It has been found out by great Rishis and Munis and they have later on prescribed it for the society. This is a very unique country where all that is knowledge comes to us through the people who really know the real knowledge. While in from all other countries most of the philosophical treaties are not through meditation so much but more from the experiments they used or experiments that they tried on human beings from outside. Knowledge does not come from outside because whatever is outside is already known. Knowledge comes from inside. Every knowledge, every part of knowledge that we see today has come to us from inside. Inside ourselves as I told you yesterday there is a universal being which is now been accepted by many scientists and many psychologists. They call it as an universal unconscious being that resides within us. They accept that all the harmony that we learn, all the balances that we achieve come to us from the instructions that we receive from this universal unconscious. So far they have not been able to jump into that universal unconscious. Though they have been able to see, perceive, imagine the existence of that they have not been able so far to find out a method by which they could jump or trigger their beings to be in that universal unconscious. The conscious mind that is within us by which you are listening to Me has got on the right hand side the pre-conscious mind and the left hand side the subconscious mind. The conscious mind receives every moment to moment the experiences and the pre-conscious mind passes it either to the subconscious mind or to the intelligence whatever may be the case. The universal unconscious is beyond the conscious mind. The only way to achieve it is to be in the conscious mind that is to be in the present. Now at this moment to be where you are which is an impossibility. If I give you a big lecture that you try to be on this moment or now at this moment to be here you cannot do it. You said, Mother how to do it, it's very difficult. It is because you are not yet made that way as I have described yesterday that there is something that has to be still brought into your being that will create a new dimension in your awareness by which you could be in that universal unconscious. And that defect, I would not say defect but I would say in completion in our being that we are not yet devolved to that point where we could be in our conscious mind and jump into our unconscious being conscious. It's at this moment I am in the conscious mind and I am also in the unconscious mind. That is very easily possible if you could somehow or other be triggered into it. That is the job of Sahaja Yoga and Sahaja Yoga is working it out. In the medical terminology you can say that you jump into your parasympathetic nervous system. Parasympathetic nervous system is the system by which we supply the energy that we use by which we balance ourselves, by which harmonize ourselves. For example if our heart is beating hard or we can make it beat hard, we can think about a state of emergency by which the heart can pump faster. But gradually it slows down by itself. They say it is autonomous, that is Swayam Chali. Somebody Swayam, auto is doing it. Now who is that auto? They have not been able to define, just giving a name. This auto is nothing else but the Spirit that is being described in all the great scriptures of the universe. And this self once comes into the conscious mind, enlightens your conscious mind, then you get what you call these vibrations known as Chaitanya Lahiri by Adi Shankaracharya. Of course these days the Shankaracharyas are only busy with their puja and all that. None of these people, none of these people right from the Pope, the Mullahs and the pundits and all these people are at all bothered about the reality of religion but they are just worried about all kinds of ritualism, what we call as karmakana. And Kabira, Nanaka, so many before that, Kukaramak and earlier also from right from Moses and Abraham from that time, they have been lashing at these people that don't take to these false, hypocritical, absolutely out of any reality these methods of getting money out of you or getting some power out of you. This self-realization as they call it has also gone into lots of funny human distortions. They have used it in so many ways that it's sometimes shocking the way how human beings have been so arrogant and not afraid of God's own power. The way they have been going and spoiling the reality of self-realization. But thank God in this country we have had many people, great many people who have described it very clearly. For example let us take Adi Shankaracharya. We are supposed to be Hindus, supposed to be. That doesn't mean Hindu, Maha, Saba in any way. Those great people like Adi Shankaracharya have described that when a person gets connected with the self, the light of the self flows through you as saunghari lahari. He calls them as chaitani lahari. At the time of Christ it is described in the Bible that when somebody touched his body a power of love went into the another person and another person was killed. This is what it is the parasympathetic nervous system within us which we cannot bring into play ourselves with our efforts. It works automatically autonomously. That's why it is called an autonomous nervous system. If you could by any chance, by any method, by the grace of God, because if you take the name of God after doctors don't believe in it, if you could jump into that parasympathetic nervous system, then you become the master of that controlling force. You become the master of that self that is yourself. That means you become master of yourself. Yesterday as I described that any amount of variations and any amount of varieties of your institutions, human institutions of say law, order, political institutions, your economic institutions, your social institutions, any type and any sorts of these are just experiments in the darkness and they cannot be complete and integrated and they cannot bring forth any correlation between human relations and the ideals that they present. There is no relationship between these two things. For example people talk of communism. They'll talk of communism and they themselves will be enjoying a very luxurious life. If they cannot by force then in their hearts they must be wanting it, they must be feeling tempted. They are not enjoying that giving away or that collective distribution. Now if you see the capitalist as you call them, the capitalist also, they cannot enjoy the capital that they have. As soon as they have little more capital than they have immediately as in Marathi they say that they pile it up. The capitalists start flowing in various ways like they start getting drunk, the money flows to dirty women, goes to all kinds of various self destroying agents, knowingly they jump into it. That means even with wealth there is nothing that happens inside. A man if by money he could get better then I think most of the affluent countries should have been very happy places but as I told you yesterday that the maximum number of suicides in the countries like Sweden which is the most affluent. So a person belonging to this wise country of ours where wisdom has been the basis of all our social and our economic and our political institutions should turn back to that wisdom and find out why. Why is it that all these so called evolutionary methods that we have by which we think we have evolved ourselves socially, we have evolved ourselves economically, we are affluent, we have learned to build nice houses and all that. Still why are we so barbaric? Why don't we get into wars? Why do we have this self destroying element? Nowhere in the animal kingdom they have such huge great self destroying institutions as we have among ourselves thanks to our intelligence and thanks to our wisdom. It's high time that we sit down and think about it. Perhaps I was born with this and I thought of it and I knew the reason was that man has not known the reality, he has not known himself. Because of this single imperfection in him he is unable to accept, to identify with the ideals that he proclaims. The whole human race if you find individually a person is capable of anything, he can kill his conscience, whatever may be his samskaras, he can become anything that he wants. Now the question of freedom as I discussed yesterday is that if man is given freedom then how does he behave? You can see all the free countries, God save them, I don't know where they'll be landing themselves, already they are in the head, already they are in the head. With all these things in your view we should stop and think and then we understand that there is some missing link within us, the evolutionary process is not yet completed. Let us going for that, let us see if it works out and if I say yes, Sahaja Yoga can work it out, please open your hearts to it. It is for your good. But human beings I don't understand sometimes, they go after things by which all their powers are reduced. For example they'll go to some gurus who will take away their money, their wives, everything, if anything doesn't materialize then the gurus will destroy them completely. But still they'll be sticking on to such gurus. Now take to any other thing like say for example economic growth or say any political institutions or any sort of a, I would call it everything is nothing but a kind of a fascist attitude towards oneself. For example you say that I am a democrat or I am a socialist, I am a Hindu, I am a Muslim, I am this and all these are misidentifications and falsehoods. But you stick on to all of them and you club together very easily to that but you are not willing to accept the real being within yourself which is universally one and by which you become that. You are not to be told about it, you are one, you are part and parcel of one being and can be established and you can see for yourself and feel only thing, open your hearts to it. You read some books, I have met some people who have read Gita. They talk Gita as if they are Vyasamuni themselves or I don't know they are Krishna themselves. I told them, did you write Gita? Did you get any experience of Gita? Why are you giving lectures on Gita? They will sit down, give a big lecture, people will go and he says, oh what a nice thing they are talking, all mental feats going on helping themselves to destroy their mental attitude. No wonder in the West most of the people I find them mad and stupid. Too much mental activity like that going on is self-destroying. There is no balance, there is no integration between their various selves that are physical, mental, emotional and spiritual. Is only possible if you could awaken into yourself. So the questions comes in, how Mother we have to do it and I said it's a very easy thing because you are built in for that, it is built into you and is the Kundalini. In my last lectures which will be starting I think from the 26th and 27th or 28th, 3 days, I'll be giving you the complete picture of that engineering that is within us all built in. Only thing the job is to put it to the mains. Once you are put to the mains how do you know and how do you co-relate with your human element to the rest of the world. For example the vibrations start flowing through you. Then what happens? Now some of you yesterday got realization, some of them have come back, some of them have not even bothered to come back. Not even understanding that such a great thing has happened to them. Tomorrow if they contact cancer, Mataji you must cure us, we have got cancer. Cancer can only be cured if you know yourself otherwise it cannot be cured. Take it from me. I've been saying this on this platform for the last seven years but nobody has paid any heed to it. But even doctors when they get cancer they come to me for treatment. Your self has to be touched by something. All right then what happens when the light of that self flows through you? The vibrations start flowing through you. You start getting cool vibrations in your hand. Now how are you to know that now these are the vibrations that are from the self. You put the same hands on somebody else. On these fingers you start feeling the tingling on various fingers and you start feeling tingling here or tingling here or you may start getting cool breeze from the another person. You'll be amazed that all these fingers here and on this left and right hand side are denoting or are coded with your sympathetic nervous system left and right. Left side doctors won't accept it, you see they won't accept. They can't cure but they won't accept. The left hand side is connected with your emotional self and right hand side is connected with your physical and with your mental self. But also left hand side on the upper region is connected with your spiritual needs. Now supposing you put your hands on somebody, even a child, I have a grandchild who is now about one year old but even when she was six months old she could immediately tell me this man is got up here or here or here. Now this one means on the left hand side on this cervical plexus there is a catch. Even a child you can put ten children together, tie them up and ask them to feel the vibrations and they will put, all of them will put the same fingers because this does not need any knowledge. You know this is burning, this is becoming heavy or this is becoming breezy. For this you don't have to have any language. Without any language you can make it up. These are the laws of God's kingdom. These are different types. They have no language as such but they are definite laws and absolutely scientific. In the sense that in the science there might be a mistake but in Sahaja Yoga there cannot be any mistake whatsoever. May be the instrument that is working may not be perfect so may make a mistake but if the instrument is all right you can see that whatever is found out is there. Now among us we have many people who have experimented, not only experimented but they have also cured people of mental and physical illness. But the trouble with human beings today, specially with our country people now, I am dealing with them, that now after becoming the developing countries, I don't know what we mean by that, we start taking to ego orientation. We have to work up our ego, we must work hard, we must do this, we must compete with each other, we must come up. The ego starts developing and the ego is such a disease that one cannot feel the disease at all. It's such an aggressive disease. I must do better than the other person, I must push him down, I must do somehow. All competitive life is ego oriented. In the West of course the ego orientation has gone into superego, that means they have started taking to drugs and receiving from life while here now we are going their way. When we'll go headlong into the same ditch we may start doing the same thing but why not short circuit the whole process. The ego orientation starts by which we the Indians have started doing things, accepting things which the West has done, as I told you yesterday. Now these you can feel it on your hands. Diabetes is one of the outcome of ego orientation. Diabetes we have cured and we can cure but we are not a curing institution, no, we don't believe in curing, we believe in giving them self-realization. Then the people who are ego oriented, they are suffering also from kidney trouble, from liver trouble and you trust them. Diabetes is caused in a simple reason, if I tell you you'll be surprised because if there's a doctor he can understand it because they don't know about it so far. There is one center which we call as Swadhisthan center which is a subtle center in the backbone which is manifesting through our aortic plexus in front in the gross way. It converts the fat of the stomach to become the fat cells in the brain. Doctors don't think from where this fat cell comes into the brain, how does it come through, how does it evolve from an ordinary fat cell to the thinking fat cell. This cell is doing this work but a man who is thinking, planning, ego oriented sort of a competitive gentleman, he does not understand that he needs a balance for his Swadhisthana chakra. The same Swadhisthana chakra is supplied the liver, the pancreas, the also the kidneys and the uterus as I told you. When one instrument or say one thing that has to, say you take one dynamo and it is being used only for running the fan then there will be no electricity available for other things. In the same way it happens that people who use this energy too much they develop a diabetic development. The ego orientation can lead further on, further on in this way that supposing you start using your right side too much then the balance has to come to the left hand side. Most surprising thing is that when you exert your physical being too much you get a heart attack. Actually heart has nothing to do with your physical being if you see that because heart is more emotional. But if you do too much of emotional exertion, for example somebody cries a lot all the time crying too much he gets a brain trouble, means he is mentally deranged. The balance comes at a later stage and that's how these days you will find all these so called organizers and the bureaucrats are suffering from this trouble that is known as heart attack. You have to have balance, you have to balance yourself. If you are a balanced person, if you are in the center not doing too much extreme of anything you are the best suited for Sahaja Yoga. But supposing you are not still balance could be given because the chaitanya that is flowing through all the Sahaja Yogis they can push the ego on one side and raise the left hand side and bring it to the back. You can be given realization also because they can raise the Kundalini, the Kundalini rises. It comes out of the Brahmarandhra here and you become universally unconscious, you jump into that where you become really a universally conscious personality. All this happens to you no doubt but whatever happens to you, you must verify and experiment with, with steadiness if you go about then you can master the complete. Now we have among ourselves here some people who have cured all kinds of diseases, even cancer, but that doesn't mean bring all the diseased people to Me. There are lots of hospitals where I can go and if I enter a hospital you'll be surprised there will be thousands of people coming to Me. But for realization there'll be only fifty. Everybody wants to take the benefit of it but the biggest and the greatest benefit of Sahaja Yoga is to know yourself, to know your power. Instead of running after things which do not give you any power, why don't you take to something that gives you your own power? But the trouble with the people as I told you, they want to run after things that take away their power. Somebody mesmerizes you, that's the best guru they have got. You must have heard about some gurus who are these days busy sabotaging you. I was amazed in Bihar I met a relation of mine. She told Me, Mataji I pray to you, I fall at your feet. I said, what do you want? She said, you know my guru is in jail, please see that he's released. I said, very good. Under their spell they are just moving, I am in joy, I am in happiness, I am very happy. This is not the sign of Self-realization at all. I am very peaceful. If you see, if you take some drink you'll feel peaceful. In the same way somebody puts a spirit into your head or if you are under somebody's help you are going to feel peaceful. That is not the reality. Ask for the reality. If you are the seekers of truth then ask for the truth and the truth is what about your own powers? Have you felt your own power? Have you tried another's? Have you worked it out and do you know all the knowledge about it? Why go after something that is falsehood? Now supposing I give you a coin of gold and that is not, I should say, gold but something else. What will you say? What Mataji has given me is nothing useless, worthless, throw it out. But in your spiritual life why do you accept? Why do you go after something that is not reality? Why are you satisfied in such things? It is beyond my understanding. So before you, as a Mother I stand with folded hands requesting you to open yourselves to truth and accept it because these are the worst times and the best times. We are at the cusp. At this time if you catch up with the truth, the truth will be shown all over the world. If you do not, of course there is going to be deluge, no doubt, but you will be held responsible because at this time you are there. You are not responsible for anything else today if you think it. See now, you must have seen that people who go to Congress, turn to Janta, from Janta to Congress, from here to there and they don't know where they are. In the same way in your everyday working also you join one job, then you give up, you take up another job, then you give it up, then you take up another job. In your possessions also you buy something, leave that, take up something, take up another thing. That means you do not feel that it is something good or worth it or you do not feel much responsible about it. But one thing you must know that there is something eternal within you. So you are made for that, you are for that, only thing you have to expose yourself to that choice. It is your own right, it is your own asking and it is the grace of God for which He has created you from amoeba with this care and gentleness and love to the simple love. We know how every day we are destroying ourselves. Now if I tell you don't drink any alcohol, you won't listen to Me, I know you cannot. Who all that Mr. Muradji has been criticized by all of you, everybody has been criticized. But you know that, it goes against your awareness, you know all that but I don't want to tell you because I know you cannot do it because you are not yet that powerful to do it. But by Sahaja Yoga once you become realized you just don't do it and if you do it you know what happens, you get a catch. If you drink even once you get a catch and you don't want to do it. You cannot smoke automatically because if you smoke you should be chakras, chakras and you can see. Because by Sahaja Yoga you start seeing all your centers you start feeling them. You start seeing within yourself what you are and what mistakes there are and how. Supposing there is a man who is a very, very ugly personality, who is very much against life. We can say some of these horrible gurus or something. You won't even see their photographs because you still as you see their photographs you are getting a heat from them and you say get out, shut it. Because your body will start discriminating. You start discriminating very easily what is truth, what is not truth. Now the question is whether there is God or not. Basically there is if I say and you say the reason you are correct and I am of the fact. The reason is once you are realized you can find out, you can put your hands and try to find out is there God or not. Just ask this question and you will be amazed vibrations will start flowing into you and your spirit will be answering to you and you will know that there is God. But you ask about some X, Y, Z who is claiming to be God immediately all the vibrations will stop and you will know it is God. The new awareness which we call as a vibratory awareness dawns upon you by which you can do it. But it's a living process, it's a living religion and it's a living being within yourself. It has nothing to do with outside these artificial limitations that are being created in the name of God, in the name of religion, in the name of these institutions. All these things are absolutely of no use and of no substance in them because once you realize it you just laugh at it, how foolishly we have been wasting our time on something which has no meaning, which has no substance. But jump onto your substance, first of all you must catch hold of your substance so you jump into that universal unconscious by which you realize you can feel it, you become a different person. This is what is to be asked for, this is to be sought in whatever you do, even your indulgences, even whatever you run after. What you are finding in all these is nothing but joy and joy you cannot find in any of these things but within your heart where resides the reflection of God Almighty as your own Spirit. And it happens, it will work out, it works out. For you people you don't have to do anything, it is an effortless thing because it's a living thing. Anything living is effort, only thing what I do is to pour little water on your seeds of My love so that your seed, your own seed sprouts, its primule comes up and becomes a big tree of joy. But you have to dedicate a little bit of your time to this very important, supreme important life that you have to be. You have to enter into the Kingdom of God and once you enter into the Kingdom of God then you'll be surprised the whole world looks like a drama and you really laugh at all these foolish things people are doing and you correct them by just giving them vibrations. The whole atmosphere starts changing because once the channels are established the flow of that light goes and people are changed. It has to work out. You must understand historically it is important. We have reached a stage whether it is either destruction or a complete construction. One of the two has to happen and those who do not believe in themselves will not be raised to that throne where they reside. I've been speaking and speaking throughout, I mean so many speeches for Me it's too much because I am not a political leader and I think I've spoken quite a lot again today. If you have any questions today I would like to answer and then again we are having a session of three days as I told you. Please do come for that then I will explain to you what is Kundalini, how to dress and what are the subtle things and the subtler things. You must have read many books so far but this is the essence of all the knowledges you can see for yourself. Not only that but I promise that whatever is the secret and the secret most as they call the Gupta Gupta Taram Gupta Tamah, everything I will reveal to you and I will tell you nothing I'll keep back because I'm your Mother and I'm not going to try any diplomatic tricks with you. I'm going to give you all that. I know some of it is all wasted sometimes and some of it is people don't value it, doesn't matter but I've decided. Now that it has to be given at least there will be many who will take it and will come up and by their coming up only the whole creation will have a meaning otherwise the creation becomes meaningless. Thank you very much. Thank you.

1976-0320 Seminar Day 1 Mumbai India

This is a recording of the speech given by our Holiness Mataji Nirmala Devi on the second day of the three-day seminar held at CJ hall on 19th, 20th and 21st March 1976. Yesterday I had told you that today we are going to know something about the Kundalini. I hope are you able to hear Me properly at the end there? Mothi bhagaha aikana aite? Oh! Today we are going to discuss and to know about Kundalini. I do not know how far the scientists have reached to locate the Kundalini. How far they have been able to see and visualize the effects of Kundalini. But medically they accept that there is a parasympathetic nervous system about which they cannot say much. They say it is a system which is controlled by itself, it's an autonomous nervous system and they cannot say how it works. And they cannot explain the mode of action of this parasympathetic nervous system within ourselves. Science in a way is a great eye-opener. Because with science only you have reached a point where you will realize that you cannot cross it, there's nothing beyond. That you have reached the last end of your search and that you have to come back. When we talk of the parasympathetic it is a gross expression of the arrangement made by God within ourselves to live and exist as human beings. This parasympathetic is partially existing in our body, in our trunk. And there is a void in our being. The Kundalini is the power which is given to us specially to be reserved for our rebirth, for our salvation, for our emancipation, for our evolution to be that what we are actually. This residual power exists in the coccyx, in the triangular bone, in a dormant state. In every human being, all those are human beings have been given this power, a special power which is placed in the coccyx, in the triangular bone, below the spinal cord for the happening of that great moment in your life when you become one with the Infinite. You are already programmed for it. God has already organized it within yourself and there are seven centers stepped ready to allow it to move through them. Actually she has to only traverse six centers because the seventh one lies below her. This is a very important point which most of the people missed. In the beginning the mistake might have been genuine that the last point which controls the pelvic plexus or the prostate gland or the sex is below the Kundalini and not above the Kundalini and the place of the Kundalini is above the sex controlling center. This is a very important point. Perhaps some people while meditating have seen Ganesha's trunk because he resides in that lowest chakra, lowest center which is known as the Mooladhara chakra. And they must have mistook it to be the Kundalini because the trunk also looks convoluted. It's such a simple mistake but it has created the greatest harm, greatest dangers for aspirants who are seeking God and who are seeking bliss and joy and who are hankering after self-knowledge. It is very difficult to digest now for the people that sex has nothing to do with your salvation. On the contrary a person who is indulgent in perversity and all kinds of sex life is barred and is thrown into hell directly by Shri Ganesha. You have to be a temperate personality. You need not be a sannyasi. You need not be a person who is running away from sex but those who are running towards sex and under the misguidedness that by sex they are going to get to religion are the most misguided seekers taken from you. It's such a problem for me in the West where we have exported our people those horrible things which have given them ideas that we must have liberation of sex, means enslavement of sex. This kind of idea started long time back in this country only where the religion itself took its roots in their awareness when people were meditating. Equal and opposite forces work at the same time and the tantricas took it over from the so-called misguided and mistaken people and they started creating enormous amount of publications and all kinds of devices by which they could see that religion in you is completely finished. There's no end to their mischief to such an extent that they used the scriptures in India. Even Vedas were tempered by those people and they started describing Ashwamedhi, Adnya and things like that in relation to sex. They started describing Shiva and Shakti as having sex relationship. They even have yogic sexologies and things like that such horrid things. Are we here to discuss the sex habits of our parents? While they are divine, they are divine forces, that's a power of God Almighty. And there's no question of sex while Shiva linga is confused with sex. When a person is tuned to something like that and if his mind is all the time intertwined into those ideas, he puts everything related to sex and that suits many people for their own weaknesses and for some innocent people who are frantically seeking God. I do not blame them. So many of them are absolutely innocent, absolutely innocent about it. They have no idea what these things mean. The other day you might have read, I think in The Current or something, they have found out a God-man. There are many God-men here in this country, suddenly coming up from somewhere, that this man was doing the puja of Durga with a sword in his hand and was carrying on with many women who were around him. He was supposed to be a great guru. Later on he got married and he was caught and then he committed suicide or something happened. But while dying he said that they have all caught me and killing me. These are the spirits which he was using. Now this kind of a nonsense that he was praying to Durga. We think that definitely the Goddess Durga must have helped this horrid man. Has she got no other sense but to be a slave to a man like that? If she is the Goddess she won't even come near him. This is the position today of this country where such great people have been born, that we are enticed away and be fooled by these horrid people. We have sold off our brains and we are listening to them because they tell us that sex is going to give you God. Animals should get it first much before you human beings stand it. We have lost all our reasoning power about it. Now why these people did the worship of Durga is very, very remarkably cunning, very cunning. For example if you take the name of God and try to raise the Kundalini, Kundalini is not going to rise. She is settled down there and Shri Ganesha is going to see to you that you have been doing unauthorized things and he is going to punish you. He is going to punish you so severely that you are not going to get any realization. On the contrary you will be thrown into hell if you do all these tricks. Now this Durga was worshipped. Why? Durga was only worshipped because they wanted that Durga should be so annoyed that she should disappear from there and that they should be able to enjoy all that free portion, all that free area with their spirits and that is why they have been worshipping Goddesses and all kinds of Gods. They have been working Shiva, they are working on all these people so that their attention is withdrawn from them. The Chitta is taken away from them. This is sometimes they call it as Virodhi Bhakti. They give big names to this cheating and this cunning way of displeasing God deliberately. It's a very serious thing. They do not know they are planning for themselves very well, a complete hellish life but I'm sorry for those who are seeking, those who are really seeking God are falling afraid. As a Mother you can imagine how unhappy and sorry I must be feeling the way these people are misguided and taken to places where they should not have been any moment. For Kundalini Jagruti, for Kundalini awakening a person has to be a temperate person, has to be a pious person. Supposing Mr. Hitler comes and asks Me that you give me realization, how can I give him realization? Perhaps this Kundalini is missing itself. These inhuman people who have taken work with human forms need not be human beings, they can be rakshasas and they can be animals. Many animals are born these days who are not human beings but they look like human beings. That's why there's such an overpopulation. These animals will go back to their places as soon as they discover that the atmosphere in which they are living is congenial to the saintly people and not to them. Saintliness, the temperance, the piousness, the respect and dignity we pay to our body and to ourselves, not the cheapestness with which we treat ourselves, the way we fritter away ourselves every day and night. That's not the way you as human beings should live. You can see that on your Kundalini that on the first chakra of Mooladhara, first chakra of Mooladhara I'm saying, because Mooladhara is a place where the Kundalini lies. She lies in three and a half coils, Mother, the Gauri, Mother of Shri Ganesha. She is your Mother too. You are the only son She has. She is like a tape recorder. She has got all that you have done in the past. She has got all that recorded within herself. And when you come to see from a person who is authorized, she rises. This morning you have seen, so many of you have seen, how the Kundalini reacts, how there's a pulsation with your naked eyes you can see. You need not be realized. You can see the rising of the Kundalini with your naked eyes. There is no befooling of it. You cannot befool people about it. You cannot just say, yes, yes, it has happened, yes, you are realized. No, it's a fact. And this Mooladhara chakra is the most important chakra in every human being where Shri Ganesha is the symbol. Shri Ganesha is the symbol which has come to us from the unconscious, from the achaitan, from the Divine. It's not our own creation. Let me tell you that that's the thing you are going to see when you get your realization. Without taking his name your Mooladhara cannot be excited, or in the sense, excited is a funny word, but we can say, cannot be enlightened. You cannot make Shri Ganesha active unless and until you have respect for your chastity. He is the symbol of eternal childhood. And when you come to your Mother, you have to come to Me as a child. That is the symbol signifying that when you want to receive your realization you have to be innocent like your child. But where is the innocent lost today? It's lost because of the pressure of, I'm sorry to say, but because of overdeveloped people. The so-called industrial development of people. When you start mechanically too much improving then you forget your humanity. You forget that you are a human being. You have to live with the laws of a human being. You cannot fitter away with your human conscience and you cannot play about with your chastity which is the basis of every human being. Whether it's a man or a woman. Chastity is not only meant for women but also for men who cannot respect their chastity are not human beings but are just like dogs. They are not entitled to get their realization unless and until you have respect for your chastity. It sounds fantastic. It sounds foolish to some people. But it's a fact and people don't like it when I tell them that you have to understand that chastity is the basis of every human action. It comes out of innocence. It's the flower of innocence. Have you seen small children? How innocently they live. How innocently they behave. They are so natural. They are so spontaneous. I do not mean to say that you should put restriction on yourselves and you should become a sannyasi but you must lead a chaste married life and be normal people. There's no need to be abnormally funny or to be abnormally strict. You have to just exist. What extremes people have reached it's impossible to describe in this small lecture of mine. So the first chakra of Shri Ganesha is worshipped in every ritual, everywhere and wherever women are taking their bath in our country we put the statue of Shri Ganesha. Let us say Namaskar to him. Let him guide us because he is to be worshipped. We have to ask for innocence from him. He emits innocence in us. Shri Ganesha has been later on taken a human form. He has taken a human form as Jesus Christ. It's a fact. But I have seen that in England a place where Christ is worshipped so much they have started a place where they have shown that he had bad relations with his mother. Can you understand that? Can you explain that perversity? Whatever we do wrong, whatever perversity we have within ourselves we propagate such horizontally. He was such a great personality who was born to save us. He came for our salvation. It was Shri Ganesha's incarnation but people do not want to believe in it. They do not want to accept it because in this country people think they are great Hindus but who really believes any one of these things because they do not want to see. If you are really seeking you can see it on your Kundalini that he stays here in the Agnya chakra and where you take his name you find that he is the door and he opens the door and you have to pass through him. He is Mahavishnu described in our books. He is the incarnation of that great personality Mahavishnu. I do not know how many of you have read about Mahavishnu who was the son of Radha. He resides here on our forehead. It is he who removes all these entities, bahdhas which are entering into us. Now there are some people, for example in London people do not believe because they think I am spreading Hinduism while here people think I am spreading Islam. There was one gentleman who was preaching against Islam and I asked him, Who is your guru? He said it is Sai Baba. I said, What was Sai Baba's religion? He says he had no religion. I said he was born as a Muslim. Now what do you say to that? Sai Baba's disciples speaking against Islam. Sai Baba or all these great gurus like Mohammed Sahib, Radha Janak and Zoroaster and all of them are the incarnations of the Dattatreya. Dattatreya was a deity which was created specially by the primordial Mother to represent the Primordial Master. This Primordial Master was specially created for human beings so that they are not misguided. This entity you know that, Dattatreya, and he has incarnated on this earth many a times, many a times right from Abraham he has incarnated and very recently about, I should say, about fifty years before I was born, he was born very near in Shri. He is the same as Mohammed Sahib and he is the same as Zoroaster. He is the same as Nanak. But just see what are his disciples doing. They are fighting among themselves. They are quarrelling among themselves like fools. They don't know that their master was the same, born again and again to lead you. They are not addicted to reality. In London there are many Sikh people. They are fighting because people, government has asked them to wear a pendant. There's a big fight going on all over. Now ask these Sikhs, where is Nanak? When did he say that you have to put on this turban? But he said definitely one thing that you are not to drink. Same about Muslims. Mohammed Sahib said that you are not to drink. You go to Iran and you will know where is Islam. You go to these people and you will know where is the great Guru Nanak has gone. He was the greatest of greatest. And this is how we have brought him to our turbans. Is it what he was? He was so great that it is beyond human words to describe the greatness of this Guru. He has come again and again and suffered at your hands. He was killed and poisoned many a times by you people. And today again we are killing him because we are doing just the opposite what he has told us. All of them have said not to drink. You'll be amazed that cancer is caused. Cancer is caused when we disobey the law of human sustenance within our stomach. And that's why I say that it is only Sahaja Yoga which can cure cancer. We do not believe in the sustenance of human beings. We do not believe that we are human beings and we have certain sustenance. We have to live according to the law of the sustenance. We are not to be on our own to be foolish. And when we start playing with our dharma, the sustenance cancer takes place. It can be any dharma. Can be physical dharma, can be mental dharma, can be emotional dharma and can be religious dharma. And what is the religious dharma? A very simple thing which our Shri Sai Baba has said. That to condemn any religion is the greatest sin. Now there are people who come to Me, what are you going to do to save Hinduism or Christianity? I said what is happening to him? If it is Sanatana, if it is eternal, what, nothing is going to happen to you. It is only you people who are perishing and you should perish because you have taken away the life out of that religion. You have taken away the living source of that religion. When they are living they are all one together. You can see that on the Kundalini. And this great incarnation resides in the void in the stomach of every human being. Now when the human being exists the first thing that happens to him is that his heart starts pulsating in a fixed state. When he is in the womb of the mother his heart starts pulsating. This pulsation is felt in the heart and that is the time the Spirit, the Atma, enters into the heart. And the Spirit is represented by the symbol of Shiva, of Sadashiva. He exists. He is there. He is all the time there. When everything is destroyed, everything is finished, still He exists. He is the last to go into the Brahma where it disappears. On the right side of the heart region, that is on the right side, resides Shri Rama. You have known Him before and I will tell you what is the connection. In the void in the center on the Nabhi of the Virata of the great being is born Shri Vishnu. Shri Vishnu is the symbol of our sustenance, of our dharma. It is Shri Vishnu who represents the aspect of evolution in the human beings. Why not these scientists ask a question to themselves? Why human beings have come from Amoeba to this stage? Why have we become human beings and how? What is the thing that has played the part in making us human beings? We could have been Amoebas, Amoeba as they call it. We could have been anything but why are we made human beings so well and how? It is the sustenance, is the dharma in everything that has brought about this beautiful thing known as human being and that is represented in the stomach as Shri Vishnu. Shri Vishnu represents the sustenance, the dharma within us is a fact which you can see in the Kundalini rising. When the Kundalini rises and somebody has a blockage in the stomach, we have to take the name of Shri Vishnu. Around the Nabhi chakra rotates a lotus on which Shri Brahmadeva exists. It's a symbol but it exists, He exists, who creates. He creates within us many things and in the universe He creates all the galaxies and all the stars, earth, moon and sun. He is, that's why placed on the second center known as Swadhisthan chakra and the third one is that of Shri Vishnu which is known as the Nabhi chakra or the center that controls these solar galaxies. I'm giving you also medical terminology so that you should know that these things are expressed also in the gross form outside. I have told you that at the heart Shiva resides in the center. First Shri Vishnu rises from the Nabhi, from the navel of the universe He rises and He takes ten incarnations. One after another these incarnations represent the evolutionary process. First you know the Matsya, then the Kurma, like that there are ten incarnations and at the time of Rama's incarnation He comes up to the heart point and from there He moves to one side because He is not a complete incarnation. He is made to be completely human to make the people follow Him. Otherwise one would say that they are incarnations how can we have their powers? So He is taken on the sides and He represents on the right side of the heart region. But in the center the power of Shiva that is Parvati enters and She resides in the center in the sacred heart and from there She protects the human beings who are seeking salvation in the voids, in the Bhava Sagara She comes to save them many a times She has incarnated as Durga. In many lives they say hundred and eight but it is much more than that, basically hundred and eight. She has incarnated many a times to save the human beings from the clutches of the evil forces that have existed in this Bhava Sagara. Now from where it has come is another story which I will tell you some other time how the evil forces have come in the play of God. But She comes, She incarnates, She has incarnated many a times before with a divine body. But later on She incarnates with a human body as Sita, Rama's wife. Then She incarnates as Krishna's power as Radha, Ra. Ra stands for energy, Dham is the one who sustains. She is the sustainer of the energy and She incarnates at this point Vishuddhi Chakra with Shri Krishna. So Shri Krishna resides on this center of Vishuddhi Chakra, centers are in the spinal cord but outside it is controlling the cervical plexus. The cervical plexus has got sixteen subplexuses and Vishuddhi Chakra has got sixteen petals and that's why he's called as Solakala, that was he was complete. He is the Virata, no doubt. He is the primordial being as Virata. Virata means the great primordial being, the complete body and that's why He appeared before Arjuna as Virata. We want to hear about Gita but we do not want to realize what was Shri Krishna. We want to use our mental feeds discussing all those small, small points but we do not want to realize Him within ourselves, He exists here. You'll be amazed how these tantric things have worked in smaller ways also. For example the people who are singing the song of Hare Rama Hare Krishna, they are quite enamored to see these foreigners doing it but you should know that this is unauthorized. They have no business, none of you who are not realized have any business to take any name of any one of these deities because you have not had the permission so far. Without permission if you enter into something then you know that you are disliked and then you are punished. So many of those people now are coming to Me in England to say that they have developed a cancer of the truth. That is inevitable. Because of Shri Krishna's, because of His disappearance from the Vishuddhi chakra one develops the cancer of the throat that's why smoking which is not liked by Him should be avoided. Smoking spoils Vishuddhi chakra and spoils also the solar plexus. Physically and also mentally because Vishuddhi chakra is so important that it controls the beginning, the root of your ego and superego which controls the complete entity of a human being. So Vishuddhi chakra is a very important, very, very important and is having the maximum number of suplexuses. It's a center which is to be respected. When you speak you use your Vishuddhi chakra. When you see the eyes, the muscles are from the Vishuddhi chakra. When you hear you do it through the Vishuddhi chakra. Through your nose all nasal activities are due to Vishuddhi chakra. It is controlling practically most of the facial things. It is such an important thing and also in the brain your ego and superego starts from there. Just by reading Gita you cannot reach Shri Krishna. Just by discussing it and arguing it you cannot reach Him. You have to take His permission through your Kundalini you can reach Him and you can feel Him. You have no right. You are not even awakened to it. How can I in England go and ask for citizenship without having any right there? How can I enjoy the powers of citizenship or all the facilities of a citizenship in a place where I do not belong? You are foreign in the land of Shri Krishna, in the land of God Almighty. First you have to take the permission through Kundalini awakening. So first of all you must get your Realization. You must jump into that. About the Vishuddhi chakra I have told you is the crossing point is where Christ exists. In the life of Christ it's so sad that Christians have really misunderstood Him and crucified Him in Dublin. They think He came on this earth to suffer and they use the cross to show that He was suffering. They show Him to be a lean and thin and pale and a serious lanky-panky person. It boils my heart. I cannot bear it because He was the healthiest man you could think of. He was the winding thing. He was like a flower, beautiful and fresh. How can a Divine Incarnation be such a miserable, pathetic figure? But these are the painters who are putting themselves onto the canvas calling it as Christ. He died on the cross no doubt, but that's not the message. The message is His resurrection where Krishna has said that's His Father. He has said, He said that it cannot be killed. The eternal cannot be killed by weapons, neither by fire nor by wind it can be blown off. It is an eternal thing and He wanted to show to the whole world that the eternity exists and the resurrection of the Spirit is the message of Christianity which is of course is over passed by all the Christians. They are supposed to be suffering within themselves and making everybody else suffering by their domination. So now we come to the Sahasrara which is the seventh home which has been described many a times. Here the Adi Shakti herself resides with all the seven forms and here the Kalaki Incarnation exists. All these incarnations are put together in a bundle together in this Incarnation and they exist together. And here where I feel the Hindus are going to face the worst of them. As it is all of them have failed but the worst will be now the Hindus failing down because they cannot understand the integration of nature. They cannot integrate among themselves. They are talking of Brahmins and what you call these Vaisas and Shri Yurkas. And then give the example of Gita for this. Just imagine the author of Gita was Vyasa and his mother was a fisher woman and he was born of Parashar Muni. You know the story about her. And how can he ever say that you are born with a caste because he was not himself born. We have got Valmiki the greatest author. He was you know was just a fisher man. And how can you say that Valmiki preached the caste system the way we are following it. No not at all. The caste system meant something else absolutely different. It meant the temperament of human beings. The people who are seeking the Brahma, the God Almighty, few of you who are here, are the people who are Brahmins, those who are seeking in money who are now busy with the banks and arranging things for their money and all that. All the time worried about their money and piling up money after money and nothing else are the Vaisas. And those who are fighting for power, the politicians busy with that, all the time thinking themselves to be very important in charge of the whole world. Such responsible politicians, they are the Kshatriyas. So you have these three castes and the fourth one is a scheduled caste which thinks by doing service we are going to get salvation. This is another tomfoolery. They are the worst type because this is the greatest foolishness that enters into the minds of people that we are doing service to others. What service are we going to do others when there is nobody as the other? Who is the other? They are all within Me and within Myself. They are Myself. Who is the other? Is this finger is the other or this finger is the other? They are all My own being. They are collectively one can be seen only through Kundalini Yajurati. You can see that collectively you are conscious, you can feel the other on your fingers. You can feel it that the other person is suffering here, here or here. What is the problem? Unless and until your eyes are opened to that awareness of collective consciousness how am I to explain to you what it is? It has to happen to you, it is like explaining any color to a blind person. I'm here before you to tell you, to give you, if you call it giving, that enlightenment. Actually it happens automatically, it is spontaneous. For example like a gardener, he does not do anything in the garden but pours the water. That's how I'm pouring the water of my love and let your seeds rise to their own meaning and you really become the same meaning as yourself. Let you feel the Divine which is surrounding you and that's how you watch and see like a Sakshi, the working of the Divine, the unconscious. And then all your worries are over because you are just watching. No problems, you exist and you see because you are a human being, you understand it, you record it and you emit it and you give realization to others, you give them awakening, you cure them, you become empowered. But gurus, what powers do they give you? Whatever power you have, material and all that, they manage to take all that and keep it to themselves. That's what the gurus are, that's what they are meant for. It's not that, this is a mother's love and for a mother you have to demand. Whatever is missing, whatever is lacking will be fulfilled and will be done. So I have described to you all these seven centers on which there are three powers which are working, one that of Mahalakshmi which gives you evolution, one that of Mahatali which gives it existence, one of Maha Saraswati which creates. It is not possible, you can understand, that in one lecture to give all elaborate idea about Kundalini. But it is possible that I can give you the working of the Kundalini, I can give you the full idea as to how it works in a second. For example now, if there is a light here and if I have to switch on that light, I have to just go and put on the switch. But if I have to explain the complete engineering of it, I'll have to put you for five years regular course in electrical engineering. So I have tried to explain to you what is the engineering within us. But human beings are not willing to accept that there is something like innocence which is emitted within us, that there is something like dharma that exists within us, that there is something like love that is within us. We do not want to believe in these things and that there is something that keeps us to the right path all the time, is the grace of God. They do not want to believe in it or I don't believe in it, but have it and then tell me. But even for that I think it's very difficult. We will go into meditation for a short time and tomorrow we are going to have a very good meditation for, from ten o'clock onward. For Sahaja Yogis, those who are realized, they can come at seven thirty. But nobody else but a Sahaja Yogi should come at seven thirty for certain reasons. Because you must know that everything cannot be said before everyone. It has to be gradation. Once you are realized then I can tell you about it because unless and until you are realized you are not going to understand it. You all are welcome to come at ten o'clock and all the Sahaja Yogis have to arrive here at seven thirty morning tomorrow. And now I would also like to hear some questions if there are any and then we'll go in for meditation. Please ask the questions which will help you to solve your problem. I'm sorry if you have not been able to hear me because of this kind of a instrument that we have. We have to have a perfect instrument. In the same way you have to be a perfect instrument to feel God Almighty.

2009-0819 World Festival Wednesday Yuva Shakti MP Cabella Italy DP-RAW

So, I'm going to try to speak to you. Applause Applause Just to see what the standards are throughout and we ended up getting $389.00 and I was wondering if you could give me a shout-out to take it. There were some interesting results but it turned out that more important questions were at the very end. Which were the writing portion questions. It was just about what do you think of the state of your shout-out in your country and how do you think it can be improved? Basically why it is this way. Many people said they didn't feel connected to the English arts team or the U.S. were not really part of the larger collective with the adults. So, a lot of people get interested in science and one of the bigger conclusions that came from the survey was that it's not necessarily easier for the U.S. The U.S. who were born in sahaj and have spent their whole lives in sahaj, it's not necessarily easier for them to go through daily life just because they've been brought up this way. It's actually almost harder in some ways that showed itself in a lot of the results because they were cross tabulated to show like, okay, were you born in sahaja yoga and how do you feel like at school with peer pressure. There were lots of questions about daily activities and whether you meditate every day, do you know the cleansing techniques for your chakras. It was not necessarily that those who spent their lives in sahaj know better. So that was one of the conclusions. The other one was bridging the gap between younger and older. Many people wrote about this in their written questions saying that they didn't understand why. Younger Yibbas always feel this disconnect from the older ones. They can't go to them. This was also a topic discussed at the seminar yesterday and steps that we could take. Some people said, well we should just look through the crowd for a face we don't know and talk to them and make sure that this is your contact person. So that was one of the solutions we came up with. The survey, that's the main points really that came out of it. We also talked during the seminar yesterday about just asking basic questions and going over basic sahaja techniques like the history of the shoe beat and why we do it. Some Yibbas may not know why and those are usually the ones who were born in sahaj. So we were talking about just collecting those questions and maybe towards the end of the seminar doing a presentation on just the history behind these techniques like the history of the haban and where it comes from. So those were the main points of the survey. Okay. Okay. One of the problems that people were... All the way. One of the most cited problems were that people felt judged, like they couldn't talk to their Yuba peers or to the adults of the collective because they're too afraid of what people will think of them. People being judgmental was a huge one. Probably the second most stated one was the gap between the younger and older Yibbas. And after that, none of it was really about daily meditations. It was really just about the collective. So I don't know if that's an indication of anything, but really it was just about Yubas being insecure and not feeling safe enough to talk about things with each other. Some countries would mention strong points and say, yeah, my Yuba shakti is my support group. But more often than not, people said, I feel disconnected from my Yuba shakti, like I can't talk to them. So those were probably the biggest, most quoted issues that Yubas brought up. And another one was the responsibilities given to Yuba shakti by the adults. Some people felt that if Yubas were given responsibilities more to do with sahaj, like coordinating a program or being pujari one day, it would give them more motivation in sahaj and not just always the regular yuba jobs of cleaning the hanger and doing trash and doing the dishes, which is good for us. But there should also be a balance. So a lot of people were talking about the responsibility that Yubas get, and some of them felt it wasn't enough. Like their collective don't put their faith in them, and that's what creates the disconnect. The survey which was made was also very specific, and it was an anonymous survey. So we actually asked all the Yubas to tell us about their personal life, how much they meditated, if they had any relationships in or outside sahaja yoga, if they had ever tried drugs, if they were ever smoked, if they took alcohol. We asked them if they believed in shimataji, if they believed in sahaja yoga, if they meditated on the free will, if they had access to shimataji's talks and videos. One of the biggest things was if they had anyone in sahaja yoga that they could actually have a personal rapport and actually talk and discuss their personal problems with. So the survey was done across the age from 16 to 28 from all parts of the world. We had 385 results in less than two weeks, which is amazing. And having such honest answers from all the Yubashakti was quite a handful. And Sue and a lot of other people have really worked hard to get all the results out. So I'm very sorry that somehow the presentation that we're supposed to have wasn't on. So all we can say that, as she mentioned, the biggest problems that we faced today was being judged, not feeling part of the collective, because of many reasons. One, not being given responsibility, not being looked after, not being loved. For our slightest mistakes, not being, I would say, in murder commas, forgiven. Yeah. Just enjoy this, please. There was also some parts about how there were some very strong Yubas in the sense that they were very connected and very good friends, but it became more social. So the sahaja aspect would decline in that respect. They wouldn't go out and spread sahaja enough. They would need a lot and go and do things together. There was never really anyone writing about only doing sahaja stuff and not doing it outside of the Yubashakti. A lot of people wrote about lack of focus and lack of dedication towards what is ahead. And it is difficult to find a balance. A lot of people wrote about it that because the Yubas, they thought we brought in some sort of extended family. So to look past the fun part and say, okay, well, we need to use this dynamic and do work together, a lot of them said it's just very easy to lose that fine line. So ultimately this is the reality that we found. So now we have Yubas which are more committed to sahaja yoga, Yubas which are less. But we knew it before, so we can't just go on saying how many do smoke or how many do drink alcohol, but that is really not important. We know none of us is perfect, but how can we, Yubas and elder ones, now sit together and say, now how are we going to change this? So let us try to get into this discussion of what maybe our requirements are and maybe our suggestions. And maybe what the outputs of the other suggestion is, because we also have to accept that the children, I was hoping for misadjoing, but for me it's different. But if I were a parent, maybe, I would think that, as Volkan said, there are some very good boys, there are some naughty ones, and there are really some that are not interested. And this we also have to accept sooner or later. That doesn't mean that you are not interested, so you don't have to meditate, or I cannot spend my time trying to convince you, trying to make a mistake, but also maybe the way we are doing things is not the best one at the moment. Dr. Kavaskar and the pre-adventures. Thank you. Who is the perfect Yuma Shakti me like? And we asked the question to some parents and to some Yuma Shaktis, and I'm quite interested what kind of answers we can get. So may I just pass on the microphone first of all to Vasquale, who is here? Perfect Yuma Shakti. So, because I've only got that concept before, Perfect Yuma Shakti. But it's quite funny because earlier on, listening to the talk and the problems that the Yumas have, judgmental and feeling insecure, which is quite a bit of an irony. Because if you think about it, as a parent, I'm a parent of three children. I have nieces, nephews, lots of them. And they are all in and around so much. And the thing is, as a parent, you love them. Love is great because you must do this. You want to actually make them feel good, make them feel strong, and make them feel the other side, which is protected. So basically, the fears they have is actually the things we all long for, this loving. We want to love them, and that love becomes smothering. They want to protect them, which does the same thing. Which is really quite weird. I'm talking to the Yuma Shaktis as a parent because you must understand, this is all coming from pure, maybe, if I can say pure love. The microphone closer. So basically to the Yumas, you can understand that from the parents, from the uncles, the aunties, it's love. They love you. And when they see little things, it's that kind of insecure love. It's really, really strange. I find it very, very hard to deal with intellectually as well. This love stuff, how it works, it varies in everybody. And what we have to get used to is like you said, judgmental. People become judgmental. I just wanted to say before, I find it very, very important to express on both sides, because that's where it's all coming from. Basically, I'm telling you, all this stuff that you feel is judgmental, and you feel makes you feel insecure, makes you feel like pushed into something, it's coming from love. If you can understand it's coming from love, then your compassion will kick in, as we say in London. Your compassion will start to flower. And then you won't feel so judged. You just say, well, that's auntie's point of view. Never mind. So I just wanted to say that I didn't take a sort of two-fire off the track. Answer? A perfect, a perfect, you were shouting. Well, I mean, a perfect you were shouting is a perfect Sanjogini. A perfect Sanjogini is basically someone who basically knows where he is. He knows that mother is the ultimate goal. She is the commander in chief. You know, she is the doer. And with that within your heart, you just get up and do things. You don't have to be asked, can you do this? Can you watch this? Can you do that? Just get up and do things. You know, feel empowered. You know that sahaja, it looks a bit organized, or there are certain people doing certain things. But actually if you come into it, you walk into that arena, you realize it's not quite as organized and they don't really know much about what they're doing. It looks like it. It's just saying the bhujma and things. Yeah, we've done it for years. We know how to arrange a few things. But if somebody came in, as a you-go, came in, just sat down and watched, helped, moved something, you know, you'll find that it's actually very organic. You know, someone will say, the perfect you-goer is someone who is beyond these fears. You know, and just knows that mother is actually the commander in chief. Shmataji is the doer. And with that in your mind, you won't have ego. There is no ego. So just come forward, help. Just get involved. There is nothing to be asked. Everybody always, just like in the UK, everybody wants to be invited. You know, could you please invite, you know, it's just like love says, you know, before you go to an Englishman's home, you have to first formally phone up. You know, are you going to be there? Can I come around? What time is convenient for you? And that's the type of life we need. Even in Sahaja Yoga, there is no invitation. You know, you're that close where you can just go, knock, break the fridge, you know, and enjoy yourself. So that's what Sahaja is. Okay? You've seen us on stage. You've seen us sorting out all the decorations and that. You can easily, you don't have to be asked. You know, but there is an inda protocol. We can tell if somebody is pushing. So there is a subtlety behind this. So I can't just say you can't do it. You know, there is a subtlety. But like I said, the first thing you know is your mother is the chief and commander. And then knowing she's the ruler, with that, you see how easily you can just get involved into things. Alright, alright. So Shamek here from US wants to answer some of that. Yeah, first of all, I'd like to say that I'm former in Uvashakti. I've been there in different countries. And I would certainly say I found Uvashakti first in Pune. I was an extremely dynamic Uvashakti. It was a fantastic experience. And I have to say that being Uvashakti in the Western world is probably unimaginably difficult for most of us. I am from an Indian background. Sahaj in many ways is a natural extension of life for those from India. So it's a huge advantage. But for those of you who have grown up in the West, I doff my hand because it takes a lot of courage, commitment and conviction to be Uvashakti, to be Sahaj in an environment which is anything but Sahaj. And I think that's what I've heard from the heart. So that's my opening statement. As far as Uvashakti is concerned, I had the good fortune of listening to some yogis who were there when Shomantji was dictating the definition of Uvashakti. She was actually on the train and she was telling Sahaj Yogi that this is what I expect of Uvashakti. And of the many things that she said, one was that they must know that I and only I am the Guru for Uvashakti. They report to no one but me. Another one, and this is in a different context where she was again explaining what she expected of Uvashakti. And in her early days in Bombay, she mentioned that they have to be in nirvikala, doubtless awareness. And this is where things get really tricky for not just Uvashakti but for all us Sahaj Yogis. That in many ways, sometimes we try to get to the effects before we have experienced the product itself. The product here is helpless awareness. And if we are not, even in thoughtless awareness, then we cannot manifest or enjoy the various aspects that are being asked of us. So for example, we are asked to be generous, we are asked to be sacrificing, we are asked to be energetic and loving and pure. But these are qualities that we can only enjoy when we are in that state. So in essence, what I wanted to say was, it's best to go back to what Sumadhi expects of Uvashakti. And more importantly than that, what is it that will allow us, and this is not just for Uvashakti, this is for all the world Sahaj Yogis, what it is that will allow us to be in that state, to meet those qualities that we all aspire to, again it comes back to every child and every mother. So I think the focus has to be on the state and the effects and the benefits and the love and compassion, everything will go from that. So that's probably one simple way of coming. Thank you very much. Each failure is a mistake that we have been asking. I try to use the easier time, but obviously you're born, so you didn't somehow choose to be here, you chose it before, but somehow you found yourself dropping into this heaven. And obviously it's difficult one year in complete bliss to understand the new island, because you're looking for something else which you haven't got, which is on the other part of the world. It's very difficult, it was difficult for me, but for other people at the time, because the world like Uvashakti around, so in Nalapant we make it well too, and somehow we were, I wouldn't say forced, but somehow forced to be integrated with the rest of the collective. And somehow we had to deal with the world which was another world, and on the other side our youth program would come as secondary, because there were other issues there. So somehow not putting, I don't want to use the word forced, but somehow the tension was violently withdrawn by something else. So the priority and all the attention on the earth that was on this rose, to this feeling that we were around, and probably we were feeling more from the atmosphere, because by being few young people, obviously people could be more compassionate, more feeling for you, you see. And I admit that there is lots and lots of judgmental will from the others to the young people. And this is something that we really have to look after, because many of us have been living a life before sahaja yoga, and know what it is, and know what you went through, and know much that we only work out after. So it's not right that somehow we feel that our kids, they are not allowed to make mistakes. Why? Why discretion? Okay, we can make mistakes, we also make mistakes, but the important thing is that they have that priority right, because then in many ways they are the kind of personality. So the first thing is for the parents and for the artists to give this support, to give as Pasquale was saying, I can't find him, they are disallowed, because this is the first thing they should feel. Then everything will suddenly be placed. Of course, once you are in the Paramchaitanya, once you have the total awareness, everything works out. That's great, but you have to reach that point, and you can't reach it if you feel judged, if you feel you have to deal with outside, if you feel you live in a place where maybe there are not many of us, Shakyam, most of the time you have to live with your school, with your friends, and you have to communicate with them, because you have to integrate also in that world. But if you know that your priority, which is the spirit, your inner self is strong, then nothing can touch you. I mean, I can experience also from my kids, one of them, or maybe two, I don't know if he's going to or not, one of them, he went through his choice, you know, and he had to decide. And suddenly this year he decided for himself that I could see from inside, I know I can decide now that sajaja is my priority, and that's it. I could see from the eyes, and I don't have to worry, he has to go and play with his balance and wear the power, I don't have to worry about his vibration and what he's got for tracking, because I know that he's strong inside, but this trust, we have to give it to them absolutely, they have to feel it from us out. So it's not that our security shouldn't touch them. If we're insecure about negativity and all that, just let's work it out, but don't put this insecurity in them. They are strong enough to fight anything, but they need our love and support. Again, I wanted to say something on the line of what Anto Poona was saying regarding perfection, because I think we always aspire to perfection, but actually we are all works in progress. And I think this is what sometimes causes, you could say, a feeling of guilt or a feeling out of place, both in the Yogeshakti and in the older yogis, meaning that we have an ideal image of what Mother talks to us about, what she says, this wonderful world of Sahaja Yoga, which she describes in all her talks. This is something very beautiful, which is there, but which we are trying to achieve. And actually, on the collective level, it happens in some moments, but in other moments it's not there. So I think the occasions like in Kabbalah or when the collective meets, it's actually a great occasion to practice this, to try to practice this perfection. This doesn't mean being hypocrites, it just means in that moment we try our best to be perfect. Then, of course, there are other moments when maybe we're doing our daily life where it's a constant struggle, where I believe we should also allow ourselves to, I don't know, we have to also blend with the rest of the world. We should push our boundaries, we should try to really understand what that perfection means. So let's say, also allow ourselves to make mistakes, to better understand ourselves, to better reach this perfection, to really understand what it means, and not to just act as an ideal all the time. We should, since it's our ideal, we should, in a way, we're aspiring to it, okay, we should also push ourselves in that direction. But not too much. If it's too much, it really becomes hypocrisy. So we should keep that balance, and I believe, again, the collective environment is an occasion for us to practice that. And we are motivated because there are so many people which are trying to do the same thing. So we are stronger that way, while when we are alone, at home, at school, or at work, we are surrounded by a completely different environment, and it's harder, and okay, that's the challenge. Still, we are talking about ideals, and we still want to know what are these ideals. I think, basically, the perfect Yogeshakti should be like what mother expects of yogis, perfect yogis. Just that we have, you know, we're not supporting families at the moment, you know, we're young and we have more time so we can maybe be more active, we have more time and this responsibility, we can live it out more. But basically, just perfect yogi is what mother expects from all yogis. That's what I think. I also agree about the fact that a perfect yogi, a perfect Yogeshakti should be a perfect yogi too. But being a yogi also means being in the collectivity, and this collectivity doesn't get only young people. And they're adults, they're young people, they're shy and everything. And I guess, as yogis we have some duties, but also as young people, as some responsibilities, and adults have some responsibilities to people too. As parents, if just imagine that parents don't have confidence in this child, how could this child grow up? He just can't because he doesn't have the support of the parents, he doesn't have the support and health and everything. It's not in the material way like I bring you up and you stand and... No, I mean, just allow them to feel confidence from others also. And just give them some taxes and lead meditation more often, or maybe going on a road, not a road, but in a city giving realization. Some responsibilities like this that made them feel that they are also part of the collectivities that they're from. I'd like to say that a lot of what the yugas expressed is their difficulty with the adults. The adults sometimes also have with each other, and some are adults. Parents have also expressed that they have the same difficulty with the yugas. They're people who don't have the privilege of having yuba children, and they feel sometimes also intimidated by the yugas. So just to understand we're all in the same boat, and that adults also inside themselves feel the same as they did. Maybe they've matured a little, but you feel the same as you did when you were young inside. And so... Um, hello? Hi. There is just a thing I would like to tell you, which is important. Young people, yuba shakti, need to have their own realization. Even if they were born in Sahaj, they need to understand the roots of Sahaj. That's why I can see with my younger brothers and sisters. They need to feel the desire, and after, to experience meditation. And this is the main thing, to have realization in Sahaj. We explain it to the newcomers. And we have to explain it to our brothers and sisters, to yuba shakti, to have the real desire to have experience of divine love. And it's just love who can cure this little thing. It's so simple, in fact. Yayi ma'am? Sahaj was saying earlier that to him the perfect yuba shakti is what Shimanshi has said, the perfect Sahaj Yogi is. And I think it's the perfect yuba shakti is someone who has a completely pure desire to be the perfect Sahaj Yogi. And I think the most important thing with the generation that's just becoming yuba shakti, the teenagers, even these kids, anyone from the age of five and above, the most important thing is instilling in them the desire to be the perfect yogi that they can be. And what we've been doing in America is we've been having, the yuba shakti have been having seminars where we invite all the younger kids to come and spend time with the yubas. Like you have in Dalio, except instead of the aunties and uncles running the camp, we have a yuba shakti running the camp. So the kids feel like they can talk to us and they can relate to us because they're closer to our age group. And instead of us lecturing them or playing talks of mother or scolding them or what we try to do is just have them spend time with us, have them have a lot of fun with us. And we notice that naturally they absorbed any kind of subtle knowledge or this desire to be stronger yuba shakti and to be better yogis. They absorbed it just by spending time with us and just by having fun with us because when they spent time with us they saw that, okay, these people have had this experience by meditating, by being together. So this is something I want for myself. So one thing I wanted to say to the parents and to everyone from each collective is that it's really, really, really important that within your own collectives that you have activities, you have events, soccer games, movie nights. Like the Australian yuba shakti, they have so many things, just fun activities between the collective and the yuba shakti. Because unless younger kids have the desire and the motivation to do sahaja work or to meditate, you cannot force them to do it. You can't force them to be perfect yogis unless they want to. And the only way to get that desire in them is for them to experience themselves, why should I be this person, why should I be this yogi? And that comes from spending time with our elder brothers and sisters, from coming, for example, on the Realize America tour, please send your kids to the Realize America tour. Or to Dalio camp or to collective functions that you have. And then the other thing, we were speaking about judgment earlier, is that Auntie Kim came to the seminar, to the yuba shakti seminar that we're having here. And one thing that really carried, that really touched us in our hearts was that she said, Shrimadji loves you all, she will love you all always, always and forever. And she also said that, and she remembers those yuvas who have left sahaja, so you have to remember them as well. And you have to care for them and you still have to talk to them, communicate with them. And we have to love them, so it's not just for the yuba shaktis, for the aunties and uncles who know people, young ones who have left sahaja. We all still have to keep them in our hearts. Thank you very, very much for your words of wisdom, which are so full of vibrations and which help a lot. I have a question now to some of the yuba shaktis, because for the parents sometimes it's also not so easy, it might not be that easy to know what exactly do they want. So maybe ask us a question, especially to the yuba shaktis now, what were the key moments of excellence, the key moments which you have experienced together with your parents, for example, which made you think, okay, there is a model I want to follow, there is something in it which I'd like to have. So can you remember, can you remember anything in your life which has been a moment of key importance for you? Like you had been, say, going for soccer, spending time with parents, and we as parents, we know that it is important, and maybe you can help us in telling us some story which had been helpful to you to pave the path that you are going. Before we start, yesterday we had the same discussion, but we had small groups and talking about how do we progress sahaja yoga, and why do the yuba shakti have problems, and I remember with them we always said that as long as the yuba shakti do not have that essential experience of real meditation, not just sitting down there with your hands open and feeling something, but getting down deep enough to feel meditation in its purest sense, and you get that first experience that you can't even explain by words, is when you understand, yes, sahaja yoga works, shimadaji is who shimadaji is. And Emmanuel wants me to tell you about Malik's experience, he was 15 years old, and he was very frustrated, he said, I come here, I meditate, I open my hands out, and I can't stop thinking, so today I am going to stop thinking. So he said, shimadaji, manda kundalini, please let me stop thinking, please let me stop thinking today, let me get that experience, let me feel the meditation. And he said he just had this burst of energy right from the Muladhara to the sasura and above, and he could just, it was like he was floating in the cosmos, and in those two minutes he realized that, yes, this is it. So that was one thing that was very nice for him that worked. For me, for myself, I think the best thing as a Yivashakti, or even as growing up as a sahaja, was, you know, when my father would take me to shimadaji, you know, he said, you come with me, come with me, and every time you see mother, mother has something to ask you, mother would, she says, why don't you eat, why don't you eat, or he says, oh, you're working so hard, don't lift so much heavy weights around, let the other Yivashakti take care of it. But the beauty was seeing mother love you, even if you made small mistakes, and seeing mother being there all the time loving you is what, is why I am today in sahaja yoga. Absolutely. Okay, so, basically for me, especially, I think for most yuvas, it's from children that are born in sahaja. So when you're young, you go to Rama Ashram, you go to India school, and you feel vibrations, and you, and you just, you're just in it, and you feel it, and then at some point you get to that age, that's what we're all talking about. And you really, as it's been said before, but it's so important, you really have to find out for yourself, what is sahaja yoga actually, and what does it mean for me, and why would I choose a sahaja life. What does it mean for me? Because you think, you know what it means, you've lived in it all your life, but like, then again, what is the importance of it? For me, I really learned that experiencing, having time with the yuvas, because I come from Holland, we don't have a very big yuvashakti, so when we went to the Swiss seminars, and I went to my first one when I was 15, and I was just so amazed about how much, how strong we all could be together, and the experiences we could give to each other, and the meditations we had together, and it was like, wow, you know, like it really worked out for us. And that's when I made the decision, like, I really want to be sahaja yogi, and I think everybody has to have that experience, and from then on you can start thinking, okay, you know, as long as you have that desire, everything will happen for you, and every yuvashakti has their own journey, we talked about that yesterday as well, and that's very important. And I just wanted to say about what we were talking about before, also like, to what a perfect yuvashakti is, I suppose appearance, what a yuvashakti looks like, is, you can't, that's also a point, and sometimes if yuvashakti walk around and they look really cool, and they like, people thinking, oh, what's going on, you know, are they okay, and usually it's just all really innocent, but sometimes yuvashakti still feel judged because of the way they look, I mean, I've heard it from some yuvashakti, and that is so important that don't judge someone if you don't know them, because that is so dangerous, and I'm talking really from what I've heard from some yuvashakti, like, just get to know them and give them love, that's the best way I think to help them, just to give them love. Thank you. Thank you. Let's just remind ourselves, the question is, what kind of key experiences did you have in your life, with role models, which can be your parents, which can be your aunties, which can be your teachers in sahach schools whatsoever, what key experiences did you have that brought you to the path where you're on? Well, I know for me, I think I was around 15, and I was, I mean, I was born in sahach, I've been brought up in sahach, but I just remember one, the very first seminar, I always look at it as the very first seminar, was when mother came to LA, and I think it might have been 2004, but before this seminar, it was like, the LA yuvashakti were not so involved, and we didn't know anyone, and the only reason this was different was, I just had one experience with one older sister, who, she just gave so much love, whereas no one knew us, and it was kind of a reputation that we had, just being from LA, and you know, like she said, you know, people, just the way you look, people would look at you a certain way, and you could tell, so, but we were young, and this was very, that's very hard when you're young to have people looking at you a certain way, and that was a barrier, and one yuva, one older yuvashakti, just showed me so much love, and so much compassion, and she said, why are you worrying for this? Just come, come with us, and we all ended up participating more in this seminar, and it really was this seminar that I can point out and say, after that, I felt like I never ever want to miss this, I want to be a part of the yuvashakti, and I want to, like the meditations that I experienced were unlike any that I had ever had in my life, and I went to dharamsala, you know, I went for a year, and I'd never felt this before, and it was because having an older yuva just bring you in, and show you compassion, and have you involved, and then that gave me the motivation to try and go deeper into the meditations, and since then it was this very first seminar, every seminar after that, and every time we've gone out, and I've seen my dad giving realizations just confirmed every time with every experience, but I have to say it was that very first seminar that really, really brought me into sahaja and made me want to stay. Maybe you can tell something of my experience, because I wasn't born in sahaja, and I came like when I was 19, and I always had to deal with, you know, born sahaja yogis and born yuvas, and I didn't fully understand what their problem was, you know, because I just said, okay, you were so lucky, and obviously I always thought they were so lucky because they were born, but after a while I said maybe I am more lucky, I don't know who's more lucky. Anyway, the fact is I understand that they might feel judged, you know, but ultimately they can also see what. If sahaja yogis that are a better race judge them, can they even think of how non-sahaja yogis are behaving towards people that are different, you know. I wouldn't have been so different than others, but you know, in the real world it's much more difficult, you know. Sahaja yogis have their defects, they're not maybe some uncles judge or behave in the wrong way, I don't know. I have many uncles come to me and they say, oh, you have a tattoo, and I say, yeah, I have. I mean, I don't feel judged because I did the tattoo, so I mean, it's my fault, I don't know. Obviously if somebody comes in front of me and says with a cigarette and says don't judge me, I mean, you're judging yourself, you know. But this is also a different thing. What I wanted to say shortly, if I can, to the previous matter, that I was, I brought up this topic of saying if uncles could give to the Yupas more power or of decision, it would help them. And I was also feeling like that, you know. But also during this period I just felt that I remember Shomata just talked about Shukr Tikeya when she said Shukr Tikeya is the commander and Shukr Nesha is the general. And you don't have to be the general, you have to be the commander because the commander just does things and the general is the one who owes everything and whose ego is always challenged, you know. Because everybody can see how he's doing everything. So it happened to me that I went in front of Shomata that people acknowledged that I did small things. But after a while it didn't help me so much because everything is still material, also the appreciation of others is not something subtle that really can bring you on. You know, it's just that you know for yourself that what you're doing and you're doing that for yourself and for Shomataji. And during the meditation then you really get something back from it but not so much from speaking on the stage or maybe, you know, being able to make some big decisions which are not so important. I was once a Yubashakti II. I came to Sargobah when I was 18. And Wolfgang was asking, you know, what is that sort of key thing that when you're young makes you feel that strikes you and helps you. And I remember very well coming into Sargobah, I was younger than everyone else in the collective although it was quite small. And I just remember looking in particular at one couple but at several people and just saying I'd really like to be like that. When I'm bigger I'd like to have a marriage like that. When I'm bigger I'd like to be managing my children like that. And it was really as simple as that. And actually in my case I kind of just strolled into Sargobah almost by accident.

Q. Is it possible to show the camera? A. What? Q. Because it's recorded on the English system from the television. A. Oh, I see. Only on the English system you have got it? A. Yes, Mother. A. Not the American system? A. Oh, we thought, in fact, we were getting tapes from the television station. A. Will they give us the tape from the television? A. Yes, we can ask them, Mother. A. All right. Q. So that's much higher quality. A. It's all right. A. I've got the name of the person. A. I know when you think I've done a good job. Q. Oh, yes, Mother. A. It was great. A. Yeah? A. It was very good. A. Because it deflected him so much he came with a direct question and then it just turned right and right. A. I have to tell him what to do. You see, he was so direct. Q. He was quite a character, Mother. A. Yes, he taught me enough himself. It's very direct he asked Me, very direct question. Doesn't matter. I said I'd better give him a direct answer. Let's just take out this also. It worked. You see, it's nice he asked Me such a direct question. Time has come to say things also. Q. It's a very good lesson, Mother, how to handle a man like that. It was a very good lesson to us on how to handle that sort of situation because he was very direct and very awkward and yet you continued by saying what you wanted to say and not responding to what he was saying. You continued by saying what you wanted instead of responding to his negative approach. Very good. I knew he was not straightforward man. Because he said you can be a fraud yourself. I said I cannot because I'm the one who warned everyone against them. You see, he got confused, you see. You are divine means are you like a child, you see. I said, what do you mean? Child like. You see, so obvious if you see the newspaper thing. Like this child being saved, you know. That boy was saved, you know. You know, in the newspapers if they don't want to know it, so what can you do about it? They don't want to know about it. Even ordinary person will see the difference. You see, people just not only the person is interviewed but also the interviewer. What sort of attitude interview you are taking. Very, very funny attitude. James liked it very much. How will? He was so strong. Yeah, I was really composed. I just love the way Mother was always turned around. You would sort of come in like that. The girls would speak to Mother. Very well. They mentioned the program tomorrow. No, twice. Here in all the programs, they are rather impisitive. And about money also I said that they don't want Me to pay for their salvation. Yes, yes. I didn't seem to realize that I didn't have to pay any money Mother, please. But just imagine, you know, people have no sense of guru in just Western countries. And it's said that if your guru is dependent on you, then you must feed the guru, must try to give all the comfort, everything that is possible. I make him or I look after him, not to point at him. Very respectful. But also he said that you must give some dakshina in the room. In the sense that, you see, something for his, rather, somebody is absolutely dependent, you see. Then you can give him some dakshina, like a present. Absolutely. But not that you collect the guru to take all the money, everything from you, rob you completely, buy those roses. You still say. So far in India, supposedly I go to other India's house. It's a great thing that I've gone. I went for them, it's very fortunate. Then they might give me a saree or something as a present. Or with food. I invite others on that day, Mother is coming to My house to come and have food. That is the minimum you should do for your guru, is said. But never said that, said that the gurus will never accept anything. You see, to give me usually saree is also so difficult, you know that, I don't think. It's an expensive present I don't take, I mean, I myself so petite. You can't give that. But as a means of, I mean, is a only way you can express your love is through your flowers or through something that you want to keep. These are little, little things you can give. So there's no harm supposing you give me something. But you know I return, doubly, whatever you give. That I do, not other gurus don't do, but I do it because I'm a mother. I mean, since when I've been travelling to India? Ten years. And before that when I came here. I mean, all, I think last time you people paid for My chalet to you know, my thing. You know, you people paid Me for My chalet. But I have to buy another ticket before I work on at Singapore. But any case you can't pay. Come here now. Now many a times you see, I don't count you to some proper. But you should pay, then all decency and health respect for My chalet. But sometimes it doesn't happen. So many times when we go, My car, so many times, isn't it, Nick? Yes, for that. How many so many travel together? I don't think. Every time you pay to Me, all the pictures. So many times I pay, isn't it? It's very true. Sometimes we pay more. Sometimes you just buy ticket, force Me to not to pay sometimes. But mostly wherever we go our cars start there. So many times. I mean, how can we expect you to pay for our salvation? That's it. I mean, even they are travelling with Me in the car, so many times I have paid for them. But it's not that because it's not to be seen but should not be done. That's not good. Should not be done that you should make your guru to pay for your travelling. That's too much and then for your food and for everything. We have had horrible people that it appears. He borrowed two thousand pounds from CP and never returned it. We have had horrible people in Sahaja Yoga. I mean, that way many have done many things like these people in Europe, in Portugal, what they did. Know that. Portugal story many few people know better tell them. I don't even know it properly Mother. It's so high handed I couldn't believe it. My ears went switched off. Absolutely. Because I was involved at the beginning and I saw the things disappear into the depth of the night and I saw you giving thousands of thousands of francs to these boys and then I heard the end of the story and I couldn't believe what happened in between. See, the story was like this. These two three boys met Me in Portugal and they got their realization. All right. So they told Me that we want to start a ceramic center here in Portugal. And this boy had a big huge place little away from Madrid about ten miles away which he could use his head. Actually he showed Me that. But they haven't got any ceramics with them. But they said that if you have, if you give us some Indian ceramics then we can hold an exhibition and invite people and then talk of Sahaja Yoga. I said all right I'll give you. So they came to London they saw the ceramics I had. They said send all of these to us. So I said all right. Then we packed up they were about this house full ceramics I had, very expensive. All that we put in a truck, sent it, we paid five hundred pounds for that shifting and for the customs and everything. Customs and everything. And when it reached there, they said one day the boy came, one of them wearing a very nice suit and this and that with the camera jumping here and there on the airport. I said who's this? I couldn't recognize him. He said I'm so and so. So I said what are you doing here? I said have you not appointed Me as the director of the Sahaja Yoga Enterprise? I said what? Director of the Sahaja Yoga Enterprise? What's that? She said we have started a shop. They showed all that to a bank. Around that guaranteed bank gave them four thousand pounds as low. They took a shop, put all these things for sale. And whatever they sold they used that money for their own purpose. So ultimately I said you better surrender the shop, return the money to the bank. It's got bad. It's incredible Mother, absolutely. Now it was a big problem because we had seen all this one. There were precious things I had. So I didn't know what to do before CP was a big problem also. So when I went to Portugal I gave them three hundred pounds. I said you buy something and I'll bring it with you to London when you come. So that I'll say it was the exchange for Portuguese ceramics. CP doesn't know the prices and all that. So they brought one dog, one cat, one this. Oh, ha ha ha ha. Monday in, I mean, I have to admit how people have been. Even now people take advantage. This is Malcolm's wife. You see she, she wanted to get some Indian stuff, you see, masalas, this, that. So she wrote to her Mother. And such a big box, wooden box came. You see shipping corporation because CP has worked there for, I mean, it has built the whole thing. So we are allowed, we have a privilege and also under law, whatever things come to us can come free. She brought and put his box with her. Last time when I was in India, she, she wrote to Me, we had one carpet of this size. We needed very badly. But I had exhausted his money in the back. I was ran through her. I said, now what to sell him. But I said, let's try the back. And luckily in the back the money was there somehow. I don't know what the carpet. So I bought the carpet. And the carpet was to come with all other things that were coming because when I'm in India, whatever things I use, then they all have to come and they can only come by ship with us. In that, I think there were seven things. How many seven things of mine? And she put her eight things. So when all the things came, they gave us seven things, you see, really were the seven things. And when we opened the box, I thought it is in the box. We found all kinds of dirty clothes. See, we started looking at it. It's all this junk. I couldn't understand. He said, throw away all these nonsense. But I got three, four dirty clothes with three of them. We didn't know it will have to be like. I have such filth inside and there was no carpet. And we lost the carpet. And it smelled like a Bombay Dux. Bombay Dux and dry fish and and the carpet was missing. I said, big joke. Where is the carpet? They said, we delivered you eight, seven things and at that time you should have told us that it's missing. We thought the carpet must be in this wooden box, you see. How are we to know that Meenakshi Devi's big box is coming? Devi. I thought, but she told Me, there's a small box coming, so I thought, must have put in one of the boxes, you see. I said, it might be coming with it. Now, but they told, they said, no you can't find the carpet, it's in your house, they stabbed. The trunk all must have cost C.P. some thousand cycles. Because he got worried. It was an expensive about fifty thousand, fifty thousand rupees, you see. What the carpet? Five thousand dollars. Five thousand dollars. So he telephoned here, he telephoned there, they telephoned us, the whole office was went to who is this Meenakshi and why and this thing gone and all that. And you know the thing started saying that they are, these sahaja yogis are using Mother's privilege. You see, it's a very bad name for us because we have been very, very sensible people all over the land. And the carpet was lost. C.P. said, that's gone, I think we'll never get it back. But the chairman is so particular on C.P.'s things, he said, how can you lose his carpet, that I'm not allowed. I'll sack the carpet. I said, all thing worked out and now when I was in New York, I think he told Me, or later on he telephoned to Me, Los Angeles, I said, we found the carpet. So what to do? Even this time when you people came, seven people did not pay Me. In New York? In India. Do Americans who came, they didn't pay Me for their food or for travelling but they incurred an also a loan of about six thousand rupees which I paid. Was that Michael? They took that money and went to Kashmir. This is Michael and Roger. What to do? Two of them ran away to Her. I must tell you, those two persons who came from Austria met Her. Betty, how? Betty. Surprising. But no money Mother? No, Betty said it was a horrid place, I went there, I saw this and all that. Oh really? There was no money. She saw them in the place, in Katmandu. She met them there. I don't know how they met, that I should have asked. How did Betty go there Mother? Yes, I didn't have their address, they sent Me a letter. Ah, she would have been going back through Delhi, to, back to America. No, her husband wanted to have a holiday. Yes. They had a holiday. So they thought they will go to Bangkok but Bangkok was horrid. So they went to Nepal and in Nepal they found these people. Imagine how she met them, I didn't ask her. She knew nothing about it either Mother, she wasn't in India. How did she know? So she wouldn't know anything about it. But in any case, I mean, I'm not going to ask them, I never asked Michael or Roger anything about it, so forget it. Oh yes, it's finished. And that Michael was fighting with John. Really? I mean two Americans came only. Unbelievable. Surprised. I had a word with Patrick again, Mother, everything's fine. That can be arranged in Toronto quite easily, for your brother. We told him. Yes, and he said that's fine, he can fix it up. No, because he feels that I think. You see, in India it's not done, you see. Whatever way you live, your brothers are supposed to live with you. Yes. I say I was small girl, I was big girl. He was only worried that on the next day when he arrives, I must telephone to Michael and tell him to make sure that he comes on the 7th. On the 7th. So that he comes the next morning after you arrive. But he said the only problem there is that if he wants your attention, there are three or four press conferences lined up in that morning. I said not to worry, we'll ask. We'll. Yeah, very sensitive people. And also we can arrange for them to be taken to. No, no, no, he's a very, very sensible, he's a very humble man. He'll be amazed. He believes in communism, that's all. Yes? He believes in communism, he thinks that communism is the only. Then on the lounge room floor will be wonderful. My very direct hand took himself. And who is he helping as a bishop? He's a lawyer for them. For certain things they have not got or something, so he's fighting for them. I mean he's a lawyer. Communist lawyer. Patrick sounds much better Mother, I think your Bandhan is working. My Jana is not that better, are you? Whatever, it's working. This is very well done. Who's done it, you? What about you people eating something, doesn't look nice. I'm eating your Mother and you are not eating anything. You all had? No. Let everyone have something. Your program in Toronto, Mother, is in the Trinity United Church. So, can't fail. You see, actually I tell you when they come out of the place, without taking the responsibility like fellas, they start boasting. Like this Marcus in the words of Gregor, Marcus. He nearly became horrible. In Switzerland. He talked in such a funny manner, I tell you. Can't imagine. He said, when I came to Switzerland, I found it didn't have a left side. Now that I'm here, Switzerland has a left side. I mean so imperiously he said. He was doing this as he said it. He's now has a left side. He's become a big kuryali now. Very particular about this that, I must say, I just couldn't understand him. Dumal, Dumal was very funny. He kept saying, Oh God, I'm gonna run away. Maybe I'll get possessed by a Brahmin too. Ah, Dumal told Me he's possessed by some Brahmin. I think he, that's what he has done. You see, some Indians have possessed these tea and people. I think so. Indians. Definitely, it's not Brahmin. Dumal didn't want to do puja. He said, I'm not having anything to do with it. It's so funny. But, I see it because all these people have their thin money. Like, how about Peter Pierce who took away £6,000, £2,000, this type. All this is Indian style business. On what order? Ah, that boy in South Australia stole $500 from Sally and Phillip. And the very first fella that came to Adelaide Mother, you may not remember him, John Anderson. He stole $500 from Sally and Phillip. John Anderson? He was the... The Indian? No, no. The T.M.Fella. The T.M.Fella. Ah, they steal always. Stealing, that's the point. It's just that some Indians are there in their roots are there. That's why they steal. And you know the another thing, once we went to a restaurant and Peter said, I'll drive you down, I know the restaurant. So it's a very out of place restaurant in India, that's not very expensive, quite expensive. And we had invited the ambassador or someone there. So when we met him, he said, Peter you also come along and have your food. So we do it, said, hello, hello, how are you, this kind. So I asked the person in charge, I said, how do you know him? Oh, he comes in very often. I said, really? Then I asked Linda. Linda said that every, practically every night she used to take us to some Indian restaurant. So I said, why did you ask him from where do you get this money? And that's how he became bankrupt. Some Indian fellow cannot eat any other food so as to get to Indian restaurant, typically India. Amazing how they work. That explains. They are like that, they steal money. Be careful. Oh, thank you. Oh, thank you. What is that? Cachatore, mother. Chicken? Chicken cacciatore. It's an Italian dish, Mother, which, in which you cook gungans and garlic and Oh, I would have liked that. Why to make separate for Me? Now I'm too full. Would you like a taste, Mother? No, little bit. Little bit, but I'm too full. Little bit I'll have from you. Let's see what is cacciatore. Chicken and tomato and paste. It's a nice. Chicken? Chicken, tomato, paste, and vegetables and spice and herbs. It's a typical European dish. It's lovely. It's a good dish. It's quite spicy and nice. Hmm, spicy. Would you like some of your own, Mother? No, no, no. I'm very full. Would you like some of the tea? Tea. Some other tea you have, no? Jasmine? Yes. And this if you put little chilli, it will taste better. Little bit. Mother, may I just put this back into the main bowl? All right. Take this also. No, I don't want to do it, but I don't know what's on yourself. This house is an architect's house, you can see clearly. Done by an architect. So this white thing is left for what? I think it's probably to continue the whiteness of the roof. The ceiling downwards, isn't it, Mother? Go over there, cut there. White thing could be for a painting or something. Or for showing film. No, painting or... So there's no wall here anywhere, you see. So that must be the reason for this. So that must be the reason for this, thank you. And inside is the, what the fire? The haven, Mother. Haven is very good. We had one here, hadn't we? Yeah, we still do have one. And it was very good. Very good idea for haven. I think from that news program tonight, we'll get a lot of people tomorrow night, Mother. A lot of people will come from that interview tonight. I think so. I hope so. Because they'll come because they... The interviewer was very abrupt and very sharp. You just cool it down. He tried to put a sophisticated attitude towards the whole thing. Above it all. As if he was above it all. He might have got panned around on him, didn't he? Yes. I mean, you were fascinating. You appeared to be completely fascinating. The way you deflected his questions and then gave him such a lot in return to sort of chew on. Very good. Put this in your pipe and swipe it. I think he was a bit taken aback. Probably a good thing that he didn't have much more time. I think he would have run out of questions. He at least gave us quite a nice... Yes, then he did that. He said where the... where it's being held, the bison. Then he, you see, he felt that there was something about his head. Then he did. Sometimes these interviewers deliberately have a tendency to sound aggressive, to try and sound impartial to the audience. But actually sometimes they're quite sympathetic to the... No, I think he's Kundalini Rose. Because when I finished with him, he was much gentler. No, no, no, possible. But I'm sure I can. Thank you very much. You've done very well. But you tell them, see, that pasta is so much of it. Pasta they eat quite a lot with their panna tortilla. Their pizza business. Spaghetti. Spaghetti. Did you see Billy and Rosie when you were in Italy? Yes, that was that. Very nice. He's working in restaurant now. There Billy has become little far in time. Oh really? He saw him because he came to England actually. He came to England, I think just before you went to Rome. Really? Yes. He's in very well. What was he saying? Well, he was telling us just about how he was working in the restaurant and how his child, Sukanya, liked being out in Italy. But they were having this tremendous heat wave. Do you remember, Italy had this tremendous heat wave and they were having temperatures of about 110 every day and the forests were catching on fire. I mean they were having a lot of problems because of the heat. I remember it drained. It drained and then it drained. Really? Really? Because they were the worst in Europe. We had a heat wave in England and France but Italy was the hottest, you know, the worst. What was Austria like, Mother? Was Austria good? Austria was actually. Great. Austria was no problem. Billy was a problem there because you see, Billy is a left-sided fellow but quite obstinate, very obstinate. He's in the towers or something or a thing. He gets into obstinacy. And what he does, he locks up himself for two, three days. I'm not going to do any work, he said. Now this fellow said that, you see, suddenly if you are working with someone and if you say, I'm not going to work at all, then what will the person do? He just telling, lock up himself, absolutely. Pobito was very much unhappy about it. Guido, yes. He's a very good fellow. It was lovely the way the Italians kind of helped you with the house, doing the marble. So sweet, you know. On the floors, wasn't that beautiful? I gave them a special present. I said, you are coming to India and I'm going to pay. They wouldn't take any money. They said, Mother, it was the best chance to be there. Mother. So I said, all right, now you don't take any money but you come to India and you don't have to pay for your food. Four hundred dollars, like that. Then they thought that is the still working. I said, whatever we can now. That is decided. So I asked five of them who were there. How's the restaurant going? Is it going all right? The restaurant is going all right? Is it going all right as such? But that is bizarre here. You see the one who makes these two thousand dollars he takes. So it's too much for them to pay. Now they have decided to remove him so they are getting no pay or something like that. They are still working it out. But now I sorted it out for them. They'll get money, food, everything. But what a place. I won't believe what a place is. If you have to see the real... You came there, no? The real blessing of your Mother, that's the place. It's in this lovely place, high up in the hill. Every room has got a bathroom attached. Some of the bedrooms are of this size. It's a tremendous place. But I think people don't realize it. They take it for granted. But Italians that way are very, very sensible, you know, very sensible. They have the sense of gratitude in their mind. They realize, isn't it? They've also got a very good quality to... culturally there's something rooted there. They've got a natural grace and a natural dignity and... Imagine they would not take any money from Me for the making of the floor, not a single pie. They held the programs in such a lovely hall for Mother. It was a hall with the painting created on the ceiling. It was a hall with the painting created on the ceiling by a realized soul. Beautiful. And you know, there's a dignity about what they do. When they sing to Mother, they sing such... from the house. And they are careful about money. When they got it, I think I paid for the hall. But the hall was very reasonably priced. Actually it was very reasonable. It was granted by the city. Yeah. You see, what happened? They went to the city mayor and talked to him about Me. And he's going to distribute them over the whole country. So you should contact him with magnificent posters. And just free of cost. Can you imagine? Italians had that. You see, he was so impressed by the photograph and all that. He did it all free, he said, and he gave us the hall at a very nominal price. I don't know, I paid for it. About fifty dollars. Fifty or a hundred dollars something. I think it was seventy-five dollars. But for a hall you should have seen it. A huge big place, you know. The town hall. Actually it was the town hall he gave us. It's Sala Boromini, which is a famous, the most famous meeting hall in Sydney, in the city. And then for the final night they hired what is the equivalent of the BBC hall. Oh, huge I tell you. It was brand new, absolutely superb and fit for symphony orchestra concerts. Tremendous, tremendous. Beautiful. And it's never ever been used for a public program before. And that's what I said. Even you are positive, thank you, then things work out. They themselves were surprised at how they were given all this, you see, that free, they say. Imagine, the authorities themselves printing the posters. And placing. I'm placing them in the proper places. Can you think of such a thing? At the hall that was worth for five, six hundred dollars. Even only for seventy-five dollars. Ruth said, even communism has some advantages. Putting the posters up. And we had at least four to five hundred people every day. At least five hundred people. And Austria also we had about five hundred people. Rome, Austria, Geneva was very good too. Programs were full. We had a couple of rat bags but Mother threw them out. The Bible clutches. The Bible bashes. But the audience actually threw them out. The audience, only here also audience did the job. Just go back one Mexican came forward, you see, very tall, fat, he got his shoes to hit the fellow. But the best part of it, the fellow who came with the Bible to hit Me actually was going back like this, you see. He couldn't come forward, he was going backwards, backwards, backwards, you see. No, I was not moving towards him. Very big, Mother. I think he was praying for it. Because Mangal Singh and this pranam were coming that side. They said, are you going to listen to this lady? They said, yes, why? He said, don't go there, you'll go to hell. He said, we are already in heaven but you'll go to hell. Immediately they dropped down the thing, see that banner on the ground. You know that? And afterwards they came to collect it. Experiences and experience. But I must say Geneva, even, even France was very good, Milouse, Milouse was great. Great, that was the most crowded place, a brand new city. Milouse. Ordinary industrial city. They did such a good job, there's a journalist there who's so positive and the pool was overflowing, wasn't it Mother? And they all. And we went to another place. Vitthala, what was the name of that? Vitthala something. I remember because Vitthala name, from Vitthala it was, that way it was. There also, you see, they said, we want to start a center. We never had a meeting there but people came all the way for the workshop. It's working out. Also Paris is doing well, I must say, Paris. And the provinces have done, Bordeaux is going to begin, actually right now there is, right now this time, there's a program on in Bordeaux. That young boy that came. And in Milouse, in. And Brittany, Brittany is doing very well. Brittany is coming up, Rouen, Rouen. Rouen, Rouen very well, yeah. See if there's any other place. See France is flared up, I don't know about England, I don't know. I think we have to travel, people have to travel. In November I'm going to go to English places. Except for Scotland I've stretched out. Okay, please. Not Brighton, any Brighton. We have had Brighton, haven't we? Yes. You had the Kudha's birthday, Kudha there. Yes, so we have finished with Brighton. I think we have to go to now which places is? Cambridge? Cambridge, yes. Norwich, Norwich is the name, Derby. Birmingham, Northampton. And they are called Exeter. Exeter, yes. Maybe Plymouth, maybe. Something about, what about Southampton or something like that? I don't know if they're there anymore. Yeats, southern part will not do now anymore. No, maybe Sheffield perhaps. Sheffield, Sheffield of course. And Sheffield of course and the other one is? Manchester. No, no, no, the one that is? York. Where? Derby. Where we got Kirby? Where? We got Bristol. Bristol. Oh yes, Bristol. Yes, that's right, that's in the west. Bristol, the centre is not good but we get wonderful people. Yes, they're also having their meetings in Glastonbury. Glastonbury? Glastonbury, which is near Bristol where they have the big tour. The big hill with the monument on top. Where all the ley lines cross, you know those ley lines? Those lines of force that go across. Glastonbury, yes. But also in Oxford they cross? Both of them, the big ones. There's several centres around England that they intercept. They're the ones that they know. Mother's telling us about the ones. I think Bristol is a great idea actually, yes. Now this one is you're talking, near Bristol we went to that place. That's Cheltenham and Cheltenham, yes. That's near there, yes. We had a seminar there, didn't we? I didn't say, seminar in Cheltenham? In Cheltenham, do you remember near Cheltenham? In the gardens. In the gardens and then we went out to the Seven Springs. Ah, yes, yes. And we had a lovely video film where you actually bless the source of the Thames. Yes, I've seen that video. It's very nice. We had that in Australia, haven't we? That video. Yes, I think it was raw and lost. Somebody told me, was it you Nick, that there's been a report on the Thames and it's becoming less polluted? It's becoming? Less polluted. Yes, I said, Thomas I. Thomas I never has to become the dandiest now. But there was an official report, I don't know which, maybe it was Magda or somebody told me, on the condition of the Thames and it's just happened. And first they had a fight that comes out like going to a big sprain and all that. Overflow, yes, that's right, there's a flood forming, yes. And you were saying, yes, you have to be careful because she's angry, you know. See, because England is also the limit. London are special. Though they have become more dharmic now. Isn't it? It's not so bad now. You do find all those new things, all that, punk rock is much less. Still too much more. But I told you about international thing. International, international, international, international exhibition we went to see in Rome. They have very nice things there, you see, some were selling some pearls, some were selling some things, you see, made in their own country, some beads, very nice handmade things in everything. And also beautiful in labours and all that. But suddenly they said there is, they said the, this is the, this is the, this is the, what you call, stall of England. So I deliberately went there. And what do you think it was? Grady, oh, Grady said. A punk rock things. Really? You know, five coloured pads, four coloured shirt, these wigs, all made with hand, all made with hand. And fuzzy, fuzzy dresses for ladies, you see. As long as they don't think everybody in England's like that. I mean it is so bad, you know, put it there, I mean, for it. And the one lady who was there, she was wearing a very funny dress, extremely funny and you, and the gentleman, you didn't come that day, now you were not. And the gentleman was wearing another funny dress which is, you see, like that, cock like thing, all coloured and they were doing a very dirty dance there, very dirty dance. And everybody was, you see, I think, Italians have a sense of ridicule. They are very, very, very, very, they have a sense of ridicule. And they were all making fun of that. All of them, they were making fun of that. Actually, Rome is, it's got certain negative qualities but the general quality of people is... They have a sense of serenity, you see. By photograph itself they understand. You see, to understand photograph to that extent and what respect and veneration they have for you. Thousands they were that day when we went to the big heart. You should see the way they behaved and everyone got up and so respectful. They just wanted to come and touch Mother. They didn't bother Her with fix My knee, fix My ankle, fix My arm, just touch Her and walked away. So beautiful. See, traditional, they are traditional people, that's all. Very much. I think they are traditional. I've seen Egyptians have that, Greeks, Greek people have this. Romans. Rome people have. It's traditional people, you see, whatever it is, tradition is traditional. They might have been horrid Romans but you see, by giving for so many years you commit all the errors and you correct. So I think traditional people improve. And that's why in Europe, England is the best as far as the young people as far as the young people. Yes. We went to Cambridge, Dhumal and myself went to Cambridge. We had a really beautiful time there and we just enjoyed the cathedral, we saw the beautiful painting in the cathedral of the adoration of the Mahajee. The whole place has a serenity. I've not seen anything in Cambridge. Haven't you Mother? You must see that cathedral. That's it. Cambridge University, Mother Mahajee. You went to Cambridge University. Yes. When I came on it, first was horrible, second one was only there were five people, out of them three ran away and the fourth one that was left, her boyfriend came and she ran away too. So only the one left was I don't know, wife, you see. She got to realize this. They had good experience. Now after that, Arno was so angry, and drained and drained and blasted. And the ishtumaya was so hard. I haven't seen such a tempest. And it was on the papers that him which had never known such lashing, absolutely. I mean we were not at all troubled. You see our car was moving and the thing was behind us. Never touched us. No water, nothing on our car. But what I thought that instead of going to London now let's go to Northampton where our Jamil was, so went to his house. Then I cooked a meal for them and we all ate. Oh yes, I told them that. Jamil was with us. I think Mother it might be a good idea if we had ashrams that were outside London but near enough for us to have programs inside but maybe it's something about living in... Not South, Southern people are horrible. Actually living in London I think it's quite a problem actually being in the middle of it all. But North we can have it in the North of London. Queen's Park is in the North. Yes, but if you're a little bit removed from it, you know like you can go down to the city and work it out but then you can come out again and clear out whereas when you're in the middle of London it's quite difficult to maintain that sort of serenity. Tranquility. Yes. But Surbiton Sea was a good place but the people, surrounding people were haunted and very aggressive. They were Northern type of people. It was first I lived in Oxford, they were all like this, you see. Very aggressive people. They're the real right-siders of England. The people in the Midlands are very good people. And the people in the North are too much so. They overindulge the familiarity and you know. Oh, they are drunk all the time. In Scotland we were going to this run-up place. And our train reached what time? About twelve o'clock and we had to, remember Nick you were there at that time, no? Not that. First time when we went to run-up. And we had to take a train to go to run-up, you see. And they said you have to go from another station. So we walked. We wanted to know which side is the station. But every person we met at that time about twelve-thirty or so was drunk. Can you imagine? Drunk at twelve-thirty in the daytime. I mean just thought what sort of thing is this. But we didn't know whom to ask because even when I went to the restaurant to ask so they were all drinking there. So he came with the greater speech and then he added thirty. Twelve-thirty they were drunk. Imagine what a place it must be. Amazing. Horrible. But it has. We have tried Scotland for Gavin, you see. He is very anxious about Scotland. But this time he went there, he came back and said, Mother don't go. Now please don't go to Scotland. Where are you from, Graham? I was born in, in near London. London, yes. But they did well in that Ireland. Ireland they did well and again there was a, you see, because they were, nobody was in contact so they wrote a letter saying that Mother should come once and this and that. I said, All right, we'll see about it. The thing about Ireland was, there was that horrible psychologist, psychiatrist who was a friend of the family who all got their realization, do you remember? He was, he was disciple of this Satya Sai Baba. Yes Sai Baba. He must have already got a heart attack, I'm sure. He was catching so much on the heart that time only. That Rustam was saying, Mother he must be out already. The way he's having, don't do your attention. He said to him, let him die, we don't want him there. He said, he's catching so much on the heart that he's not going to suffer. Rustam is doing well. He is giving realization to people. You see what he says that he calls them and he puts some sort of a cover on My photograph and he can't see it. He said, Mother said, now put your hand towards the wall. You see like this. Muslims like, Muslims like a blank wall. They do? I'm giving them realization, you see. He goes on their back and puts his hand down. He doesn't understand what's happening. They are getting well, bad people getting well, alcohol is getting good.

They like a blank wall. You know their homes, Mother, they are absolutely stark. Not in there, not in there. Talpana says it's all full of gold, golden work, golden this, that. Our house, she said, is absolutely for a riyadh. This is a modern era of Burdasandharan. The prince and all that. I mean that prince who came to see our house was settled down there. Said if I had money I would have purchased this house immediately. Rustam is a very tricky fellow. Because you see he had a lady who was senior to him. Indian lady never married, very manly type, stayed all over the world, you see, like she was the one who was head of that. And then he came and I said all that, I'll do something about her and I gave her bandhan this, that, you know. When he went back he telephoned to Me, says, what have you done to this woman? She has become like a little goat under My feet. Rustam was very lucky. He just applied for the job, next day he was called, just like that. And from very quick, you see, he is getting a pay as much as C.P. gets, I think. Making a big money. He sent two thousand dollars for American tour. So it seems now we have settled down in Vaghovar. Today's last interview I knew, you see, if I boast about Myself then it works faster. I didn't boast but it worked out that way. The fellow asked Me a very direct question and now it will settle, I'm sure it will settle here very well. It's going to settle very well. As Ron suggested, after you people get quite good at Sahaja Yoga, then you can shift to some nearer places, like there are seven cities, you see. So one of you can go to another city, another can go to another city like that. But one thing one must understand that one should never quarrel among yourselves, never. You should never quarrel, never challenge anybody else. And now say, Laurie is here, she is the one whom I know and she is supposed to be in connection with Me in the sense if we have to write we can't write to everyone and you should not feel bad if I write to her and ask her or tell her anything. Till I find she is absolutely useless, you don't bother about her. That is important. If I find her useless I'll throw her out, there's no problem. But you people leave it to Me, all right? So I'll be connected with her, whatever she says and guides you should go and also she will not because she's a lady, you see. So ladies have a little restrictive nature always. I'm also little bit like that sometimes. But if the men have the expansive nature she should allow you to expand, go ahead with it. But you should not be like a bounder also, you see. And we must understand that money in Sahaja Yoga is to be, one has to be careful about it. One should not waste money on new projects and new things. That should not be brought in. If you want to do something you do on your own but not to bring the central fund for the help of projects. It's all right for the program or for this thing. Later on I'm sure when you have more people here you won't even need that much for your halls and things. You may not need at all any money at all. You might be able to do it yourself, all those things for your own center here. And that's how we should try to be independent as far as money is concerned. And if you have any projects, now these people have had so many projects like that. I never give any money to them. On the contrary they have been giving money for this. They have sent so much money for the work in America. All the Australians have established themselves. Always they have come with a simple. So one should understand that money should not be wasted anywhere. There's no need to waste money on things. And should be careful because this is the money of the saints and we cannot afford to waste it. You have seen how careful I am myself about it. So one should not waste the money like that. We have to still have a very good school in India to begin with and we have to have those five, six big ashrams that we are building for you people. And you can always go and stay there and we have lots of plans for you. If you want to have a hut in Mira land, we might be just about five to six thousand rupees or so you can own a hut there. But you see we cannot give ownership as such in according to Indian laws but you would have it as a what you call that as a breeze or something. So you can have it all the time for yourself in the ashram. All this we are providing you. But now we have one problem is to have the school and have this Mira thing little bit established. So it is quite substantiated by Indians you see. Indians have never, never asked Me to give them money. I must tell you this one thing. So far for the book, Pragavar's book, partly of course I donated, partly they did but whatever was possible they did and Pragavar's book was published and now I have money for re-publishing that book as well. I mean I kept that much money back for re-publishing. So now the thing is in the same way. We have to try to develop ourselves completely independent. Now these schools will be available to all your children, all those who are realized souls will be available. You can also go and teach in that school and also the Sahaja Yogis can go for their conferences. It's a very good school and a good place where we are going to have it. But for that also we need money and I think I told them that just now only if you can spend, how many, how many? Well it's going to cost... Hundred, hundred dollars. Just a hundred dollars per Sahaja Yogis. Hundred dollars. Every Sahaja Yogi should try to save for one year and send it over to Arno, we put it in gold and I can raise the price of gold and then we can have more money, double the price. That's my idea. Because the amount that we have now is something very, very little to be sent from Europe and America because we didn't have so many people. But this would be only hundred dollars per one year, once a year, once for lifetime you have to send it for this and that we'll try to make something out of that. Indians have already got eight lakhs with that and in Bombay they have, Delhi they have got about four lakhs of it. But Indians are really, I must tell you, they have never put anybody on line, never. And for the first three years we never took any money, all those who came were free. I would not say that hundred percent they bore the thing but actually fifty percent expenses they bore. He went with us one day, first time, when he was, what was the year you were? I came to you in 1980 Mother. 1980. So we started this thing from 1974. So you can imagine four years, five years. Yes, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74. No, not 70, 74. You see 74 January. Oh I see, until then, yes. Yes, 74 January went. So 74, 75, 76, 77, 74 you came. I came in 70. 80. 80, 80. So it's 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 5. So you came in 70. So you came in 70. So you came in 70. So you came in 70. So you came in 70. So you came in 70. So you came in 70. Because I came at the beginning of 80, so we count 79. So we count 79. Five. Five years, you see, we sustained. Quite a lot of people asked them for their food, for everything. We looked after them. Actually the year I came to you Mother. You came later. Yes, but even then you were offering to pay for everything and you just didn't consider taking any money. I mean we were so bull headed we didn't even think to offer either but never mind that is another story. We paid for your stay and everything. You did. But travelling I think you paid. In the end we did Mother but we needed a few promptings. Some people told me that pay for your travelling. Yes, I mean I really spent a lot of money doing that but doesn't matter what it is. But now what I am saying that now we have to understand that we have to have our self-respect that's why these things are concerned. Actually the amount that you people have gathered also to send to India is so little that I felt shy. So I have bought gold out of it, it is lying with the wars back. So that also one day we rise and we will be able to. Actually Mother this hundred will just be the beginning I feel for the West. It will just be a nominal contribution from now on. I think the West will undertake a tremendous effort in this regard and certainly I will be doing My best to encourage everybody because. We can do it hundred per year can we? Is it too much hundred dollars per year? At least Mother, at least. I mean if we can raise fourteen thousand for America, I mean in Australia. Fifteen thousand altogether I mean putting My money too little bit. It's only the beginning Mother. It's only the beginning. It's only the beginning. That's a token. We should do so much. We have to think on a big scale. Every year hundred is all right I think would be sensible not more than that. Every year hundred is all right. Pardon Me... Yes please. Oh, there is another one. That's very little. It's such a privilege Mother, such a privilege. You know, now that's it's too little I think. All right, doesn't matter, let's start with this. Let's do it one year like that, we'll see about it. All right. That's now you see, there's not much need because they have got money in the bank in India. But I mean, Indians if they can do so much, what about us? They will give you the land, everything and then when you go there you'll have a comfortable place to live in. That's the main thing now you don't have any comfortable place to live in. We do Mother. And we have to pay, no it's not so comfortable and we have to pay quite a lot to them also, isn't it? It'll be more economical, more sensible. It's more economical. And also now you see, the prices are going up. So I have said now four thousand rupees for a month. Everybody is shocked with that only, the four thousand rupees per month. But what I'm saying, I can't say next year may not be so and maybe after two years or three years I may have to stop this. Then you people will have to move above and it's for you people only because everybody has a house in India who's going to stay in the ashram, you people. I mean we cannot have an ashram like this in India, no question, because everybody has a house. There's no question of anybody staying in an ashram in India out of question. For Indians? Indians it is out of question. They've already established their dharmas and they No, they all have houses of their own. If they are young they stay with their parents and they have their own houses. They have bhajstas, no? So everybody has a house sort of thing. So ashram if you have, I don't think Indians, unless and until they retire, they won't be there. So it's you people who need an ashram more than anybody else. From this mad world if you have to go out, sometimes you must come to India. So it's hundred thing you should send it to Arno. And for the journey is four hundred. To My dollar account and for your travelling. I'll have to find out. I'll send a circular as soon as I go back, I'll find out from Air India what is the situation. Mother's going to try and make a block booking for North America as well as England and Europe. And you go by Air India, no problem. You see Air India is adjustable for us. We can talk to them, they'll take all your luggage, no problem. You see you go by some Iran Airlines or some sort of a thing and get stranded. Some people got stranded in Kabul, you know that? Yes, yes. So why this? Kabul! Kabul, you don't know this? No I didn't. Who were they? Two percent of them. Two persons got stranded in Kabul. That's what a place. They came by some plane, I've forgotten the plane. This was not this year, last year. I've forgotten their names. And they got stranded in Kabul. Then a telegram came to us saying that we are stranded in Kabul. So you see all these things one should not try. You see if you cannot afford to go, better not. But they mustn't go on any of these special Gulf Air and all that. Because why, why to do such a thing? I don't understand. You see some of these Kabul, what airline goes via Kabul? Oh Heaven's Mother, I don't know, it's probably, probably Afghanistan Airlines. Afghanistan Airlines, Afghanistan Airlines. And they got stranded there because this problem of thing was there, yeah. Russian business. Russian business. Russian business. Yes, Afghanistan. So they got it Afghanistan Airlines from where I don't know and how they arrived there I don't know. And they got stranded in Kabul. So straight forward you must go. And another is they told Me is a very bad one is. You should never go by. Gulf Air. Gulf Air. Syrian Airlines. Syrian and Gulf. And you, you had problems. Yes I was stuck there with an open ticket. Where were you stuck? Well I was in Bombay if you remember Mother and I had this open ticket which I thought great I can come back whenever I like. When I got to Bombay I found out they weren't running a jumbo, it was like a half size plane and there was a three month waiting list to come back. You put a bandhan to it Mother and you got it immediately. Yes. But normally. Three months waiting list. Yes. Yes because everybody was trying to leave Bombay because the summer was getting so hot. I'm shouting at Graham for being so stupid to book it like that. I thought it would be good to have it open so I could come back when it was convenient. You don't go to India on that basis. No no this cheap cheap cheap real life you see is very dangerous. You know I had to pay a complete ticket last time to America. We bought one ticket then see we paid for my ticket second ticket. The whole ticket was cancelled completely the kind of a ticket we had asked you. The next is the expert on giving such a ticket. Don't go to him. He reacted with the limit. I know in fact he when I wanted to go to India he was offering he was trying to sell me a ticket that was ridiculously expensive. You know so expensive. Very expensive ticket to us. To us either he gives very expensive or this kind of thing. This time he gave a big expensive ticket to us also. Isn't it? No. Actually you gave him the instructions Mother to just buy it like this from the Air India. At 280 I told him there is one at 280. But you told him he didn't even know. He was giving for 340. Actually he still tried to charge you more then I said but you promised Mother 280 and he wanted to charge you 299. Really? That's very bad on his part to do like that. And he had already agreed to 280. You've actually gone to the opening of his new office as well. Yes and he is doing very well with that. But he doesn't understand that he should not make money out of Me. He very quickly changed his mind. And the first ticket he gave Me was so bad that we had to change. And I said now return this ticket to you because I don't need this ticket. Mother to get to Canada had to come. That's terrible. Had to go from Houston up to Dallas. Dallas across to Los Angeles. Los Angeles we had to run between two aircraft. Mother was running literally. Then up to here to Vancouver. All in one day. And then a program the same night. Wow, really. No, no, no. We'll not have him anymore now. He is trying to even cheat there, eh? I didn't know then. I saw you telling Me something like that. That's what upset Billy so much as well. When Billy was working for him he said, I can't stand it. I'm a Sahaja Yogi. I can't stand working for somebody who thinks about money all the time. I think it's much better to deal directly with Air India. So we'll do it directly and then give us some concession they said. But whatever it is we'll work it out. We already get 10% automatically in Australia so I'm sure Mother will get better than that. No, I can't get better. Well, I mean better in the sense that better than what you get. Sippy said he'll get through that. He said then what is my commission? I said what is mine first of all. What is mine commission? Never taken any commission so far. I mean you don't know also how to do it. But honesty plays a long way I think. Come ahead, Eddie. You see, that way we have been doing very well if you see to it, you see. People have been living in ashrams, in such beautiful ashrams in England, isn't it? And we have had a big huge hotel to ourselves, two big old huge places. Then the Surbattin was another great blessing to us I tell you. And that Nightingale Lane was another blessing. I mean people could not believe their eyes that they are living in such good places. Surbattin we spent a little more money for, but all this is your own property forever and ever so it's all right. We bought some washing machine and that also we got so cheap at one-fourth the price. Ask him. Yes. There was some modelless stuff on it. Nobody could believe it. Sheets, blankets, bedspreads, dining room tables, chairs, cushions, lounge suites, washing machines, dryers, fridge, freezer, washing machines, everything. Seven thousand pounds worth. And one big, you cancelled that one thousand out of us. When I saw it all coming upstairs I thought. So six thousand you could say for all that. Actually that if you cancel that one thousand thing you bought it. That lounge, soup, everything. That car thing from Italy was how much? Seven hundred? There was the red one? That sofa set? I think the red one, I don't know. It's about seven hundred I suppose. Thousand, no? Maybe another, yes. More than that. How much you remember? No, I don't know exactly. You mean the red one Mother? I thought it was approaching a thousand but I think it was a thousand. I didn't actually see the price on it. So you can imagine. And then also three sofa sets. Three sofa sets all wood, with wood. And sheets and beds and bed, everything, everything that you could think of. Even a kitchen, dinner services, knives and forks. Dinner services, knives and forks. And then you can see the whole thing. Tablecloths, napkins. Tables, how many tables? Four tables. Four tables and how many chairs? Sixteen chairs. And solid point. So many things we bought you can't believe it. And a nest of glass tables. A nest of glass tables and one big coffee table nest. Glass and what else? Beautiful. Glass. I had a very good feeling. Beautiful. Brass. And one complete, brass, brass suit. Complete brass suit, you see. Top things that. Can't believe it. No one can believe it when you see that. Beds with drawers and everything. And carpets. What about the carpets? Carpet was for, it was for how much? One pound, not even one pound per square yard. What turned out to be? There's a very, very good bargain. Very good bargain. It was one pound of fifty p or something like that. First twelve yards. And with a matting, rubber matting behind the door. Shri Mataji, Laurie was telling Me about this house. Did She talk to, have You talked to Mother? She was just mentioned but not how much it cost and all that. Well, the owners are an investment of some trust company or something and they're anxious to be rid of it. And I know that in real estate means that it's a liability to them and therefore the market price would be quite good. But they need to get themselves established with this registration as a charitable organization. So I don't think they've got enough money here to do that. They're literally very near the edge. It's not going to cost much, just a few hundred dollars. But we can, perhaps all of us can perhaps help. Yeah, why can't you help them? Just to help them get the legal identity. Actually they get a further grant from the government for that, on top of this. So when they're buying the house, if they ever got to that position, they would get a further grant from the government, being a charitable organization. Oh, that's good. That much I'll give you, whatever you say. All right. You let Me know tomorrow how much you need, all right? I was going to ring a few barristers in town here just to find out because I know the ropes or James knows the ropes from Australia. We've done it now and we can just ring a few people and see what's involved, what the costs are and what the requirements are. Perhaps you could do that tomorrow. Yes. And see, you know, just what we're up for in costs. No, that's what we should do. I mean a house like this is great for Sahaja Yogis. Wonderful asset, Mother. It's a great asset. But then how will you purchase? New Sahaja Yogis are coming. Yes, that's true, but you have to pay down payment or you have to pay the whole little bit? We haven't looked into that yet, Mother. We haven't looked into that part yet. It would be like that, though. But if it is a trust thing, then you'll get it very cheap, I guess. Yes. We may be able to get a co-opt type mortgage, a co-operative mortgage. We haven't checked into that yet. James could have a little look into this tomorrow. He's an expert in this. Oh, yes. You're the expert, Mother. You see, it works out. That's all I can say. But I'm not an expert. It works out more with me. Things work out very well. I know, Mother. It works out in such a beautiful way. Sometimes you just can't understand. Mother, may I just mention one thing? Now, the Mother ashram in Sydney, it's up for sale. In Sydney? Yes. Before I came away, Mother, I made an offer on it, without checking with you first, but of $160,000. It's worth about, most probably $190,000. But he wanted $300,000, Mother, and I told him that that was far too much. And he's sort of talking in the vicinity now of $250,000, which is still a long way. But at the moment, there is a sort of a negotiation going on. And then I came here. But I don't know, Mother, whether that would be a good idea for us to buy it. Perhaps that money should be better spent in India. Things like that. I don't know. See if it comes off. If it comes off, then it's meant to be. I was going to continue it, Mother, when I went back. And they just give one... You see, I think if you can expand it, if it's a freehold thing, you can expand it more, because you may have to bring something on an upper story there. Yes, yes. Be better either. You see, when My birthday was celebrated, I mean, the people were really jammed up completely. It's a very huge thing. There should be a place, I personally think, should be anywhere, whatever it is, where you have a large, growing hall like thing. You see, because last time there were so many people. That's what we like, Mother. In Sydney we really like that, and we'd be very grateful if we ever get something that's more suitable with a big hall, like we found, for example, in Switzerland. That's wonderful. Little away from Sydney, might be. Little away from Sydney, if you can get some places, it would be even better. I certainly investigate that, Mother. Yes, you see, this is all right investment or whatever you may say, but... Long term may not be the right idea. Long term it may not work out. Even when you said it again. I did have some doubts in here about it, Mother, but I just started it to just let you know. Little away from Sydney, say, little away from Sydney, if you can get a big place, it's better to have it, you see. For the same amount you might get a bigger place. Oh, we would, Mother, out a little bit, yes. Yes, you will. And that's better to be there, you see, because of course, I mean, a place like this is good for people to come down and... You need something central, but... Center is all right. But a meeting place. One thing meeting place, but actually, such a place could be in a good locality, some place where people can come for weekends. Then stay there for weekends, you see. The same style, yes. And that... And every weekend they could be there. All Sydney people can come for weekend there. And then contribute some cost too. They will contribute to the cost as well. This is a new idea of Mother's actually, where the people that don't necessarily live in the ashram all come to the ashram for the weekend and contribute to the running costs. Little away, if it is from Sydney, they would like to come here in May, or near a river or something, just to come down there to have a little sort of a... I think this is a much better idea. Then Saturday, Sunday, if they stay with you, you see, there will be more, sort of much more there. Stronger. Mother, I'll get started on it as soon as I go back. I'll do something about it. That's a much better idea to have. And it's substantial and nobody will disturb you there. See, neighbour's problem, this problem... And there's more space to expand. That place in Sydney is a bit limited, it's tight. You must have... you can get it in... I know I've seen this fellow who was this... what was his name? The one whose house we had that lawn we went down, huge big lawn, settled down there, whose wife is Polish. Which country, Mother? Switzerland, at your Sydney. You don't mean France. Bill, Bill Brandeis. Yes, yes. You see, he had a nice place, but the place was not covered, you see. So if you could have something like that and cover, or we can make a hall there. You can make a... Like using the back lawn as a big hall. Hall, yes. And sort of we can have a hall, double hall, say, or maybe that for people, ladies to sleep and gents to sleep. And then you can have a hall, double hall. And for people, ladies to sleep and gents to sleep. Some bathrooms. Hall below and bedding above or something like that. Yes, you see, and some bathrooms. One good bathroom or community big bathroom for them, like many wash spaces and things put together. You can build something like that. They can come for them. When you come to India, have a look at the plans of the school that Mother's drawn. Ha, that's right. I'd love to, yes. Something like that. So that so many people are there, you see. The more you come in contact with each other, it will be a real outing. You can have your programs, you can have this, that, children. It would be wonderful. Everybody would like to be there. Because when we get together now, Mother, we have a problem of space. We just burst at the seams there. And we're growing so quick. And you are going to grow very fast now. Oh, yes. Because most of the gurus have withdrawn from there. You're going to grow very fast. You must have a big hall. Yes. You can make yourself a hall of your own. No, we can. The Golden Builders can build it. That's no problem. Yes, yes. No problem. We have an architect anyway. Oh, yes. It should be double storey. Why? Because top you can sleep and do and... Yes. ...you could be bathrooms upstairs and down below the... Golden Builders, Mother, is very prosperous now, thanks to Your Grace. Yes. Tremendous. Our people should learn from You. Really. She's very good. They've never had so much work and all these things are working out. And they're getting all their work, Mother, in churches. Mainly Mormon churches, Mother. What churches? Mormon. Mormon. Why today, Science? You probably... It's an American... Mormon. ...nonsense. It's an American Buddhist business where they believe that Jesus Christ was born in America. Yes, Mother, they do. And they're very... They're quite big in Australia. M-O-R-M-O-N. Mormon. Their headquarters is in Salt Lake City. In Utah. And they're very, very big. They're big on family life. Actually, many of their things are dharmic, but they're completely wrong about the... But what is the need to have Christ born in America? Well, I guess it's a bit of ego. There's a man called Joseph Smith. Had a revelation. And he found it on certain tablets. It was written on a mountain somewhere near Washington. Oh, yes. What does he say? Apparently, they found these tablets. They say the founder of the movement discovered tablets, you know, large stones with writing on. Declaring that Jesus was born in America. Who wrote that? In English language, was that? When Christ was born, there was no English language. Was it suddenly John Smith? Yes, Joseph Smith, his name was. Very unlikely name. But in what language did the tablets come from? It would have been in English, wouldn't it? English. In English. Ah, must be the English one. Joseph Smith, yes. Smith, you know, the Smiths are very big. They're very big. Smith, you know, the Smiths are good at the smithereens. Smithereens. Smithereens, it is smithereens. So, Smith, Smith. With Mithya. Smithereens. In Sanskrit, Smith means, Smith means smile. Oh, my, Smith. But it is not though, it is Smith. Not the other one. Not that one. Not that one, no. Marjorie Bassett style. I said, we don't show our tongue. That's not the way. It's very bad, bad manners. The lady who was our publicity, who was supposed to become our publicity agent in New York. She started teaching Me English. Came in and the first thing she said to Mother was that, well, we're going to have to fix up your accent. You don't speak English properly in the American world. No, American style you should have. Mine is, she said, My English is out of date now. So I said, all right, now how do I speak? She said, you say, thought. We say, thought. Not even that one. I said, we don't do like this. It's hideous, I said. It's not enough for me to have it. So I said, we say, thought. It's a much deeper way. Thought, is that the way English speak? Not a thot. But this is also ego. You see, if it is English language speak like English. Why should you have American English? This is also another ego that we can do anything to the language also. Isn't it? If the whatever is the basic language, why don't you speak like that? I can't understand. Supposing we start speaking like Hindi, English language, you won't understand a word what we are saying. American Hindi. American Hindi. It's not even an accent or a dialect. It's absolutely careless, lovingly speech. I know that is accepted. Now we have a say, our South Indians will say, judge, judge, judge it. Not a thot. But this is also ego. You see, if it is English language speak like English. Why should you have American English? This is also another ego that we can do anything to the language also. Isn't it? If the whatever is the basic language, why don't you speak like that? I can't understand. Supposing we start speaking like Hindi, English language, you won't understand a word what we are saying. American Hindi. American Hindi. It's not even an accent or a dialect. It's absolutely careless, lovingly speech. I know that is accepted. Now we have a say, our South Indians will say judge, judge, judge it. And they will say, walk close. Like that they talk like this. You see walk close. Like that you see they say like that. But it's all right. I mean we know they are like that and they accept that they are like that and it's wrong to say but they say like that. All right. Judgment, they say, judgment was not good. Judgment was not good. Judgment was not good. And like that they speak like that. Then we have also people like from Sipis province, they say, Anki, they say Anki station is, they will put it not station, they will say is station. Is station. Yeah, India. Like that you see. And Maharaj says, I have, I have. Like that you see. They have a style of speaking. So we all have that kind of thing in India. Even English people have their own styles of speaking. But that doesn't mean that if you have those things that main English is challenged and they are accepted to be the right thing to do that way. I mean English must be spoken like the English. But even the English don't speak like English. I must have. They have changed the way some of these people speak I would say like that. Pat, Pat or Maureen is now alright, she is educated. Pat and Pamela and sometimes the worst is this Tony's wife, what's her name? Dawn. I can't understand what she talks, you see. She's aa, aa, aa. Ten times she must put aa in between. So that's another uneducated style I think whatever it is. So they also don't speak correct English. True. Isn't it? But on the whole and, and Scottish and the West and all of that, Scottish, Scottish is our own our own. Absolutely. Our Scottish hero Mr Mark Callahan, I told him now will you please speak, write English to me. Can't understand. Really and that is one thing about me. I cannot understand any language which is so much mispronounced. So American is absolutely out of question. And that way Canadians are good people you know and also Australians, they have not changed the language so. But Americans they, they want to teach you how to speak English of all the persons. That was amazing that morning. I couldn't believe what was happening. I said she's never had this happen before, what are you talking about? She said well we've got to change it, it's just got to be. You've nobody will understand you. And I mean everybody understands what she says. But she, she told me the answer. She said you see Americans is a humpty bogart style. Humpty doxy. She said, she said you put a cigarette say on in one side then you have to wait for on the other side. And if you are putting this side you have to put from the other side. So they are used to that kind of thing. She made a thing like that you see, she closed here and opened this side the thing you see. This way. I was quite surprised. Not straight like that. So you have to speak from one side or from the other side. That's why the language became like that. Best was pranam. He was teaching some people, Americans how to say bhagavati. They couldn't say bhagavati, he said. Then he said, he pulled his ears you see before Me. He said Mother please forgive me I have to teach them so I have to use some sort of another style. So they used it which ever they said. All right say bhagavati. And they did say. Oh my God. It's interesting. But this ego will go away I think they will pick up the proper languages. And English has spoiled also now like these Cambridge people they will say supa meaning super. Super, super, super. If it is to be said super they will say supa. Arbeezitna. Ladida. What is that? They share a ladida as the sort of way they speak you know. Very sort of they exaggerate all the vowels, all the vowels are exaggerated. Very large they say, instead of large they say large. Everything is exaggerated. Darling you are so mild. Basically this speech with a mouth like I wish there was something round in the mouth a ball in the mouth like that in the public school you see. Our doctor. Rustam. He used to speak like that. So one day Rustam said take out that ball from your mouth and now he will speak properly. He is more the oh no not really. He is more oh no definitely not. Who? David. Spider. Arbeezitna. He is more sort of a round. He goes round in the mouth. But he says that's how they are taught in the public school. Yes it's true. Rustam has got a very beautiful accent. Has he? Rustam. But in Hindi he just. No no no that I mean in English. In Hindi he has told me that I went to Indore. Indore. I said Indore? What do you mean? Went to Indore. Look it is fine. I am very bad. I am so hopeless. I have no brains. So my my granddaughter came and said Rani he is saying he went to Indore. Yes I said Indore. I said you are saying Indore. I thought how can you go to Indore. Either it used to be in or to one of the prepositions. But it is Indore. Dhar as we said T H E Dhar. Indore. But he said Indore. I couldn't understand how it is used. So all those D's in English. I thought I L D O O R he said. It is indoors. It is Indore. Dore. Duh duh as we say Indore not duh. Duh. Duh duh as you say T H E. Duh. Duh. Duh. Duh. Now what do you say to T H E? The. This is the. The book. That's the book. That's the book. The. Indore. She said Indore. Indore. Hindi is rather difficult. But Mother the people who speak beautiful Hindi who were at your program in Delhi and they heard you speaking one night. They were pundits from the university, teachers. They came out absolutely saying that for somebody who speaks Marathi so perfectly but who speaks Hindi with such not only perfection. They think I am very great scholar of Hindi. Yes they think you are a scholar of Hindi and they said the pronunciation is flawless. They used the word flawless. Yes some more Hindi I know because I have spoken it in many lives and Sanskrit that's how I know. Beautiful. We just enjoy the vibrations even. Really I am very good at it. I think Marathi language itself is very powerful and Hindi is second but English I can manage somehow. English not so good as Marathi. I cannot be so good as. I think it's very difficult to be humorous in a language and you are very humorous with English Mother. English can be such a dry language. English can be so dry but you make it so jovial. Yes. I say what happened Mother the way you speak and you joke that our unions that now the Sahaja Yogis are forming labor unions. All right. So we had a nice time together. Thank you very much. I hope you all enjoyed the vibrations. Thank you very much. May God bless you. So tomorrow morning what time? No program. Unless you want to do something. Mother would like to do some shopping. Because I want to see what is left and what I have to get. We just have one thing. Now I am borrowing back all the presents you know. In the afternoon. We have one thing in the afternoon that's all. Just a radio interview. That is a later. In the afternoon Mother. That's later. So tomorrow. So tomorrow morning I'll have the bath with all the elaborations because I was quite nervous to see the way you have made all the elaborations. There's no need to bother. You should have just filled the tank and I jumped into it. Only thing to get out of it for maybe two hours. Architect you see must be enjoying that bath I'm sure. Yes. Yes very is. Meant for the architect. By Myself I made you see two bathrooms like that in My house. But huge big like this you see. And you can get down by steps. It's like a tank. Roman bathroom. And it can be also used like ordinary bathroom. Like you can just get down and have a shower there. Or if you want you can fill in the water as much as you like and have a bath in that way. Because Indians don't eat that. Have baths of that kind. Like shower so you can have a bucket and sit on the on the staircase in the stairs and and you can have a bath. And you can have a bath. On the staircase in the stairs and take the bath. Which would be like lots of things. That's Japanese style. Romans. But Japanese you see have very very funny people. They give you buckets you see there will be five six uh.. buckets and five six types. And you have to first wash under that. All of you put together. And there's a common tub into which you have to get it. So horrible thing is. Japan may be the last. Because already so many Russians have got realization. So I don't know what's going to happen in Japan. With your Mahakari thing. Yes Mother. I really got caught there. Ah this is the big one you got. Oh I have got some smaller ones like this. We can give it to these people. On the pujari. I will give them my pujari. This one is wonderful. You people gave them right? Such vibration. It was our very first pujar when you arrived in Australia Mother. And we got these flowers just out of the blue. We didn't know that they were auspicious. Ah I know. And we went and just got them. You know what happened when I was going I told, Terrence was driving. I said stop the car we have to get these flowers you see. And then we went round and he forgot about it. I also forgot. When we went there you got all these flowers. They were already there. They are the things meant for the Red Bull. Tremendous this pujar. Even see the face and all that's so withdrawn. Just Ganesha's face. So powerful Mother. Tremendous. That's a good one Shri Mataji. That's out of the one you will be. Behold the Mother Mother. And that's the one that was taken by Turner. Is it? Is she here? No, the year before last. We brought it to India as a gift for. Year before last year. By Turner twelve months before. The pujari was a blue and red cheque. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I remember. That was another luck they had I know. Blue and red I know where they got it. Yes, yes. All right. Good night sweet dreams. I will name him on the day of our pujar, all right? May sweet name. Thank you Mother. Okay sweetie. And the rice is fine, that's me. Oh, oh, oh, working it out very much. Yes, yes. I think he's still a bit hungry. No, he's dead. He's got the gas. That's all right.

I say, I'm really not supposed to smile. He has to be very serious. It takes me hardly even two minutes. To start laughing, yes? I don't know why people are so serious. Not because he's so serious enough. Just to enjoy everything so beautifully. Which has the creation and so good. Thank you. They said that we want to show the Goddess God. Ah, yes. Now we have it. No visas to come. They said last sea of the sea. Slow down. They know you are the music. Really? Really. Wow, they are already. They are already. Would you like to stand here?

What's happened?

Girls this side. Girls on mothers left. Boys on mothers right. All the girls were getting married by that side. They are applying oil, some of them hopefully. Otherwise it will never come out. It took two months the last time to get the stuff out. Married girls, girls getting married to girls this side. Boys on mothers left. We can't save them. We have to save them. They must learn that they are sorry. They are already sent home. I have to go back to the hospital. I have to go to the Officials Department. You are going to what? Help everyone. Do you want me to go to the hospital? No, it's on my way. Get going. We're all alone with Christmas. Get me here! I'm going to play a little bit of football. I need to know where to stick my finger in.

Hello. You come along, sit down there at the end there. You have to sit in the line. Hello. Come here. Why didn't you comb your hair? I was manager of barber shop and masseuse. Take the comb from there and comb your hair. You wanted to see Paul? I am just telling Paul so he will go and remain. He is himself busy. I will take the comb from there. Where are the bridesmaids? All the bridesmaids are looking very nice. I have taken out the bad eyes. You will be married now if you don't move that side a little. I will give you a gift. As soon as your husbands coming you better put up your finger. As soon as your bridegrooms are coming you put up your fingers. Keep it on the sides. Whatever things you have, keep it on the sides. Don't get involved. You are all right now. Just don't worry. Leave it to Me. I'll manage. Yes, it's all right. Your bridegroom has come? He's your father. But it's all right. He has to do it now for his trying to find out about. Father will be needed at the time of wedding. Come along soon.

All the boys are taking more time than girls. Come along. Please tell them to find their own wives and sit down. Why have they gone to the sea? This madness of sea is also too much. They were going to the sea towards them. But they can't do it here? What is the need to go to the sea? They should have done it. That's not proper. You see, to be arbitrary is not proper. Is he a bridegroom? You see, you should not do any arbitrary behavior like going to the sea suddenly. Everybody is waiting for this to be done. The briderooms or brides, you don't move out because it is going to be difficult for us. Where is Bernard's wife? Raise your hand. I think, if you could put the camera here, you could take the photograph of all of them, better than. Now you have had enough of mine. Any enjoyment? Come inside. He's a finder.

Now the big complication is they're not in any serial order. It's all right. I have created that. No. It's all right. There is no need just now. Just pass. Now you tell the guy. Anthony, quickly. Where is that Massimo gone? Very good. Now you tell him. He's a finder. Come here Massimo. Is he there? Some of the young boys. Who's missing there? That's Massimo. He is not here. Hurry up. He's speaking what now? He's going to fetch him. Two or three more have come. Come on. Just go down and find your bride, okay? What's happening to you? Damn it. It's okay. Fast. Come here. Come on over there. You are the bridegroom? So sit at the back. This side. Massimo. Now they are coming. Someone is going to see where he is. An uncle then has to give it to the girl.

Now the mamas be careful. It has everything in it, all right, boys and girls. Have you done it? Do it fast. Now you see. Go faster with the coconuts, please. This time all the mamas must get up and give these things in the lap of the girl, like this, again. Now, just a minute, you just listen to the instructions first, then we'll give you the signal for the window. All this has to go to the girl's side on her lap. Now the mothers have to put it in her lap to be better, put it in the lap of the girl, all right. So now it is given to the girl, whatever it is, is her property or everything that represents the wealth or the Lakshmi of the family is given to the girl and that is given from the mother's side because she's the Lakshmi and she's going away. So symbolically the Lakshmi of the house is given this. The boys have to give it in the lap of the girls.

Now after doing that the mother should show the girl the ornaments that are there and cover her with the saree and first of all take out the things or even if you do not take out the saree, it's all right, but first of all take out the things that are meant for the boy. Now, when the ladies, the mothers, have taken out the things that are for the boys, these things are to be brought and given to the boys. That's first thing. The girls should keep quiet with these things in their lap. Now all the other relations of the girls, whatever ornaments they want to give, can give ornaments later. But one by one I'll give you instructions. Don't do it in a hurry. Now first of all, as I said, the mamas have to get up, cross over and put it in the lap of the girl. Should they do it now? Aha. Okay, all the mama do it in the lap of the girl. And the girl doesn't do anything. She just waits until the mother shows up.

Mama representing all the mamas, I have also given you Ganeshad as present to every boy. See, for the boy and the girl, both of them, we've got one each. Two hundred and fifty-two are there, so it's all right to give both mother. So all the... First now for the boys. All the mamas you see back at your place. And all the foreigners must get there also. After getting these, the function is over. All the foreigners who have come from the western countries, eastern countries should take one Ganeshad each. All the boys and all the girls. I just remembered the caps, Mother, so may I just pass one to each man? No, this is not to be just now because this may be spoiled. You see, we'll have them. To put in the bag, no? In the bag we'll give them, just now. Or you can give them later, once they have got half.

Now, the girls, the boys thinks whatever are to be done, they are going to give it to each other, whatever will be given for the boys, whatever you want to give to the boys. Now take it out, I have a chain to be given to all the boys. I have got a chain for them. Yes. So the mother should come and tie the chain for the boys. So when we give the signal... Not just now. When we give the signal of the mother... Let me see. I'll show them. This is the chain which I have given as a present, Myself, to the boys. Let it be. Yes, girls. These are the things I have given to the girls as a measuring present. And also these. All right. If there are some short, doesn't matter. So all the mothers are ready with the presents for the boys? Just the chain for the boys I am giving them. Whatever is to be given to the boys apart from that, like someone wants to give the rings and other things, should be brought in. Some people have a ring, relations have rings and things, have to be done. When I give you signal, first of all just tie the chain and then whatever are relations are there, they want to give something to the boy.

What's she saying? I don't know, he's got a gift for somebody over there. This mama has for that one. All right. Anybody who has after these, there should not be any hurry and scurry. Those who have gifts for the girl or for the boy should give the relations, the friends or anybody. But don't hurry up, just now one by one, because it's quite a mess then. See the girls are sitting with all their things and they should not be disturbed. They have to keep everything inside the packet is better, the girls, so that it is safe. Put everything inside the packet, if possible. All the ornaments, everything. Mothers can help them, put everything inside. Don't put this one. This you keep outside. The thing that is here, don't keep it inside, it might be spoiled. So this Ganesha also is a present from Me. Very nice. The climate is very good. This giving of Ganesha has brought this silence. Now this is in charge of for him. All right. Now what did I tell you? Do you remember that? That the ladies have to move slowly and tie the thing in the neck of their son-in-laws. Okay, now all the mothers. Be careful, don't drop the pendant or anything. Do it quietly.

Now whatever the relations or anybody has to give, should give. On either sides. First give to the girls. Now. Just a minute. One more thing. Those, all the boys, ladies who have got the Mangal Sutra should give it to the boys because they have to tie it up. So the mothers should take out the Mangal Sutras and give it to the boys and they must keep it safe with them and you must not forget to bring it for the wedding. We didn't know we had to bring presents so we'll give them later on. That's after marriage. No, this is more direct relations. This you keep it carefully. These are just the presents from the immediate relatives. If Sahaja Yogi have presents there'll be another opportunity later in the day to give them. The other thing is the boys have to be very careful not to forget the Mangal Sutra this evening because this is part of the marriage ceremonial. Now those who, I beg your, those who. Immediate relatives. Now if some people have gold Mangal Sutras to begin with, then they have to be very careful not to forget the immediate relatives. Now if some people have gold Mangal Sutras to be given to their bride, these Mangal Sutras must be given to the boys. All the people relations. Those who want to give gold Mangal Sutra to the girl, that also must be given to the boys and boys must be very careful. And those who want to give rings and chains also should give to the boys. Chain in the neck. And also rings, some are giving gold rings and things like that to the boy, should be given now. All the rings whom you want to give. All right, just now for the boy. Then when you have to go to the girl I'll tell you.

Please sit in meditation. This is, we are in front of the Adishakti. Those who have nothing to do, please I request that to meditate and to sit. Everybody sit. Please. All the rings, all the mangal sutras which are to be tied have to be given to the boys of gold or anything. Have you done that, Linda? All the people who have made gold mangal sutras, please give it to the boys. You better handle it. I don't know who are the people. And the rings also, gold rings. So now some of you have got even gold mangal sutra. Those who have got also gold mangal sutra or these things must keep them carefully with them and must be brought at the time of the wedding and people are to be reminded.

Now. Whatever you have now to give to the girls, you better give her now. All the ornaments and everything. Not the mangal sutras but all the other things. Whatever you want to give to the girl. The relations also. Close relations. The family who have present for the girl, please it's now time to give to the girl, for the immediate family. Whosoever. No. The boys or the relations or anyone. Whatever goes to the girl. Oh, you don't get up, you tell the mama. Mama has to give. You should give it to the mama and mama gives to the girl. But other direct relations can give it to the girl. But the boy, if he wants to give anything, then they must give it to the mama and the mama should pass it over to the girl. I'm the most direct. Now, everybody has given. They have been given? No, not yet. All right. Now, where are the ornaments? Fifty one ornaments.

Now I'll give you instructions. What is it you have to have your food? Take some rest. And I think, not just now, I mean after some time, because we have to still pass on the ornaments. Then all the girls should take all these things carefully, the girls' mothers should go with them and the bride's sisters, they are important. They should go with the girls. Keep everything carefully, take some rest after food and then you have to dress up according to the timing because all the girls have to be ready by six something and the boys have to be ready at six o'clock. You have to have the food quickly. Rest with them, it's the same as this one. Be sure to keep all these things carefully. After you have done all these things, you have to be ready by scissors, with your hands and feet. Now, the bridegroom will have to start from here at six o'clock on the horses. The process will start from here, I'm not sure. But the girls should not get out till the boys are gone. And then I'll come here for the Gauri Pujan by that time the girls should be brought by the mother. Boys. Yes, the procession of the sea. They are to get as the Gauri Pujal. And then, you see, they should, ladies should be dressed up fully. Right? They should have all their saris on, with their things on, all their ornaments on. All these things should be done for ladies. In the same way the boys, when they get onto their horses, they should be dressed up fully. All right? They should be tied with this, all this should be done. For that the boys, brothers should help them. The women should be dressed up fully, and the mothers should be dressed up fully. The same way the girls should be dressed up fully, they should be completely decorated with the big marriage, and the mothers of the girls and the fathers should prepare an aarti. For the boy who is coming, and that is to be done when the boy comes, he is to be received with aarti and with a tikka.

When they return after letting Mataji speak. No. After going round the whole thing, I mean, after the procession comes. After touching My feet they go round the place, on the horses. After touching, the boys will be remathed, and after continuing their procession, the marriage will be here, and I will be remathed to celebrate the grand pochade. Give it to the boys. And then they will be brought up by the mother and the son. Then I will give them. Can I give these out at the same time? Let it be? When they will be getting on the horse, it's better to give them. No, just before that. This you keep it with you, I'll tell you what. You see yourself, what is this? This is for your bribes you are giving. Don't give it to Mr. Jayka and the other gentlemen from the brass. It's beautiful. Shablog leh na aikki. Except for Jayka and something. Done now? You got the last one I sent you, that one. Yes, Mother. Very good. Mother, was that fifty or fifty one? I gave you the one. Last. This one again has to be given to the uncle. And then that one is to be given to the girl. You have to get up and give it to the girl and then take the girls with you out from here. All the mothers and the mamas should take the girls. So when we give you the signal. Confusion o jata na, ek meri teri hai. Don't do it before I tell you because it's a confusion then. All right. We will give the signal when you have to do it. And make her comfortable and keep her ornaments properly somewhere. When she gets up she has to wear her saree, her blouse and everything.

Now, please slowly get up. And cross over. Should we announce that the couples eat first, not that they have to cure? For all the Sahaja Yogi here it is clear that you let the couples eat first. The couples should not cure. It's a buffet system. So first of all the mamas of the girl and the, they should see that they give food to the girl and to the boy. They should serve them food in the rooms. They should come take a plate each and take them in the room so they have their food and come back. And the mother should give food to the girls. Actually in our custom the mama has to pay for this food. I am looking at Mother G. All right, so now the mothers have to give the food to the girls, make them comfortable, keep all their things all right and the boys are to be looked after by mamas. You should bring the one plate each, give them food and let them rest. And then afterwards the dressing up has to be done by the best man, by the brothers of the boy. The girls must be looked after by the mothers, no confusion. And the boys must have their food in their rooms separately. Yes, Shri Mataji. By the mamas. The mothers feed the girls and the mamas feed the boys in their rooms separately. And take down the plates and everything and let them rest. Now the mamas won't meet the boys till they arrive at the time on the gate where they will do the aarti, where they will receive them as bridegrooms. So after getting down from the horses they'll be received by the mamas and will be guided down to the places where they have to stand in a queue. So you have to come in the numbers, one, two, three, four like that you have to come and stand in that line and the mamas should provide for the garlands. Now the garlands will be in the hands of the boys and girls in such a way that the flower garland is first and then another garland behind it, which is a shining garland. And once that happens, the mamas can come and sit down. They should stand there with the garlands. Now the organizers should know that time the akshatas must be distributed. Now one thing is there, after once, now you are to be married. You'll be tied with a thing in your hand, all of you. Once that is tied, you are not to go here and there, it's now you are going to be married, you can't just run here, can't go to the sea or under the tree, no. Keep together, it's very difficult, you see, to locate a fifty one people. So everything is arranged but you just do one thing not to run above. Now you are grown up men, you are married, be responsible. All the mothers should tie hakunda for the boys and the mamas for the, before they get ready or after they get ready actually somebody responsible should do it before his gathering. All right, it would be better when you come here after marriage, we'll tie that but they'll give you a jhanva to be put. Then that tying up will be later. But once this is put don't run above.

QxSH-fgtJjA 9977

Okay. This is the eighth section. I long to all the seekers of truth. Today is a great day when mixed with the birth day of the Mother of God. I realized that in this country the Mother of God was worshiped very much. And that's how I discovered why you are so sensitive to the child. About ten years back I went to Poland on the first of seven. And I was extremely unhappy and sad in the play. So my husband asked me, what's the matter? I said, I don't know, something terrible has happened here in Warsaw. Now when we got down and we found on the street, he was carrying some wings. So I asked, what is going on here? So they said that today is the day when Warsaw was born first. And that people did not come that day. That's how I was very, very sad. And in Poland there is an icon of maybe, which they call as the black hole. And then they said that this icon, it creates perhaps. They took out the projection of this icon, which I saw. And I was surprised they had vibrations. Maybe the artist who came here must have been there, realized so. After so many years I am here now with you.

Do you remember those days? Those days are over. I do not know why people use cross as the symbol of Christ. Because it hurts me that he was crucified and he glorified at this point. No one else can glorify the crucifixion of my son. But it is so they do all the time to glorify God. They told Sahaja Yoga to believe that Christ is bestowed upon all death on the unfit child. Because all these efforts on all these great incarnations and on the great character. Because on the cross of the child's mind he was placed within us. We must understand how important it is for us to forgive everyone. Because Christ said that on the cross he wanted God to forgive those people who tried to crucify him. This center is very important. And Russia has one part of the center. So one must understand how important it is for Russians to forgive all the people who are in the center. I must say they are giving for God. I have never done so much of fighting with the evil forces of England. In their sufferings they became very spiritual. And thus I think they have written to Sahaja Yoga so easily.

Now the point of Sahaja Yoga is of such kind higher than other because this Iran is over. That doesn't mean we have to forgive Christ or his money. We cross that center and enter into this area also. This is the area where you have to have absolute knowledge as told by Christ. You have to be comforted. Your illnesses have to be cured. You have to feel frustrated. You are to be counseled. You are to be told what is the subtle knowledge of your being. Not some sort of a sermon that was there or in the Bible that was there. But now you have to see through the deeper meaning of Christ's life. He got resurrected and the message for us that we have to be resurrected. This is to be understood now that we cannot just go on praying to God or using the Bible or going to church. We have done all that. Now the time has come for us to reach the fruits of our dedication to God.

The third thing that we have done is Sahaja Yoga is redemption. Meaning you get yourself that. Redemption means cleansing. You become elderly. You become innately religious. You know what is right and what is wrong. And you don't do any more anything that is immoral. This is what was promised to you and that is what is happening. This is what is said also in Islam. No use talking about Islam. Because already you see that Muslims are no more religious people. They are very violent. Everywhere they are fighting and they are killing it. Ask people it's all right. It is also said for them that at the time of their resurrection, the Ahmad, they will feel the vibrations or the cool breeze on their hands. Because these hands will speak and will give it to you. It is against you, tell you what's wrong. This is exactly what is happening. Would the Islam say the same thing? Would God say that at the time of resurrection there will be manvayah, and the incarnation of manvayah of three mothers. That is Mahakali, Mahaswami and Mahayana. Whatever they do with it, these are the three powers which are going into Godhead. Why the Mahakali power? You get comfort. And why the Maha-at-thi power, you ascend. These are the three powers which Buddha has said that in the future Buddha, manvayah, Tukka and in the Zarekha.

But what has happened? The Buddhas stick on to some ideas which were not of Buddha. So they don't want to recognize that. But through these vibrations when they know themselves, they will know who is the mother. With these vibrations you will also know who is the Holy Ghost. And through these vibrations only you will know about God and no one has ever said who is the Holy Man. This is the climax of all the videos where you get connected to the divine. You know about God and also you know about yourself. By knowing yourself only you can know God and you can know who is who. But if you are stuck to one body, maybe because you think that better use all these old incarnations because they are not here. You can say, we believe in the Brahma. It was better to believe in somebody who is dead. It's a belief in the living person in the God. It's a very good cause. You avoid that truth. Then you came and you don't very well know Christ. So they say we believe in Moses and our Savior will come after you come here. How were these huge sufferings? They are still waiting for the Savior to come. Sign of their Savior is the same that of the Ghost. That the face of the new incarnation will be covered completely with the sun. So if you look out for someone like that, in Israel now you can start with the rajim that Sahaja Yoga involves.

But Muslims are buried. They are buried in condition. I don't know if Sahaja Yoga can reach them with that extent as it can reach the Christians that it can save them. I feel very concerned because they will be lost and finished for it. They are fighting each other. Another fixed idea which I must tell you today is very long among all these people. I don't know from where it has come. You see Bible was not fulfilled by Christ. Not Quran is fulfilled by Moses. So a very illogical idea has crawled into peace. That the dead will be resurrected. I met one fellow, sir, was a Muslim who had some or other escaped the war and came to Austria. I was surprised when I asked him, why is we feel for the land if we believe in the formless world? He said it's written in the Quran which I'm not a professor. But he said that it is written in the Quran that if you find in the name of God and if you are buried in a grave, then you will be coming out of the graves and will be designated. Now it's very illogical. See those people who are put in the grave. After only, say, five, six years, they come to the city, throwing boats and... It's not abstract. And after that it starts even the boats are here. So what will come out of the graves that you will give resurrection? How is it possible? Resurrection has to be given to the living people. This kind of a funny feeling, I don't know what's going to happen.

For example, in India only a realized soul is buried. If they are not realized, they are burned. But what I find in the West, so many hands are wasted with these graves all over. Instead I've seen them put them like rocks inside the mountains. What after? What is the real? The real thing is the soul will be born again and the soul will be born again in a body. You state the resurrection will be born. That is the reason why many people don't believe in the gingers. Because they can't understand. So we have to understand that when we are in the big state only, we are going to get the resurrection of our self-realization. Now supposing you get some bones and then you think that there is a resurrection. How will you understand Sahaja Yoga and the centers? They are all Indian people. But there are many who believe in it even now. Now after realization you know the truth. That we get our self-realization in the living state. And we are aware of it. What's the use of giving self-realization to bones? I have the bones too. But this kind of a funny idea sticks into the heads of people who are noticeably believe in it. Belief should not be blind anymore. But it should be absolutely through your awareness. Through your central nervous system you must know everything. Whatever we have achieved so far in evolution we know on our central nervous system. We know whether it is hot or cold. In the same way we should know about this all-pervading power of the one love on our nervous system or our feelings. Not blind. You cannot follow Sahaja Yoga's light. You see for yourself that now you have become Buddha. It's your light. Your fingers can tell you what centers are wrong with you. And not only that but also what's wrong with others. Because you develop collective consciousness. If you don't develop that how can you say what is wrong and what is not. Suppose if Christ comes. How will you recognize? If the Holy Ghost comes in how will you recognize? If the Christ's demand comes in how will you recognize if you are not a centralized person? If there is a thief coming from jail and wears a press light of Christ and says I am the Christ. How can you still know? You have to have your enlightenment on your fingertips. Don't become slaves of any ideas.

Now there are flowers. All the flowers are not flowers but snakes. But people are I think mesmerized or conditioned that they believe all things are flowers. You get your Self-realization first. You just say that the Kundalini rises and brings to you your Father's name. But if you do not develop your awareness into enlightenment you cannot become senseless. I am very panicked. Once I was in Kashmir. And we were in the car and the driver was driving us and suddenly I felt tremendous happiness. So I told my husband that there must be a chemical of Swahipur or maybe something is there that I can feel. So I told the driver take the car and say. About five miles we went. And the Cartesians were in the room. There were some poor people who were mostly Muslim. So I asked what is this they are doing? They said no there is no time now. There is one here. No man's house here. Five miles away I felt the vibrations of no man's house there. Christ has said that those who are not against us are against Him. But to develop that sense completely you have to grow a year and a half. Now a new awareness has started. By which you enjoy yourself. I have seen people from all over the countries come to Jain and never forget all of them are loving, enjoying, together. They want to be engaged, might be a religion, might be a sense. They all know each other. All of them are so much connected. Without having any organization, without having any system and any correspondence or anything. They feel so secure and confident. How do you trust them? We talk of peace, these are the peace of God. They enjoy their peace. It's a new era that has started. Era of enlightenment. Those who are entering into a road, some of them do try to get some money out of it, maybe some power out of it. They play some relationship for source of time. But then they realize that it's story. What is this calling? Enjoy it, how? So when they come to Sahaja Yoga, they settle down in complete stability and love. In Sahaja Yoga there are no fatwa or anything, ever. Is somebody who comes to Sahaja Yoga is behaving, you forget this, okay? The greatest fatwa is when he will be telling you get out of Sahaja Yoga. That is the greatest punishment. How can they give without the love? There is no money as you know, don't have to pay any money for Sahaja Yoga. Maybe for this state you might have to pay your ticket. But don't have to pay any money to me or Sahaja Yoga. You don't have to pay for your self-realization. You don't understand money. God doesn't understand money. And you become such beautiful people that you rise above all these complications. Of course, if you are thinking of where you are, very well, you need it, then Sunday once at all night, next year.

That means you have to surrender. Islam means to surrender. You have to surrender God, not your money, not your property. Not your place, not your emotions. But your ego, ego that makes you look like that stupid fool. The man who grew as ego, really looks like a man. He'll go on talking about himself. He'll go on propagating himself. Everybody would be laughing at him. We say that in our Bhai Yogananda's Maharshi language that a person is trying to climb over bush. They cannot ego of anything. Somebody has ego because they are a big no. Somebody has an ego because they can still discard. Like this, it goes on. Politicians, bureaucrats, they are making it worse. But if they take to Sahaja Yoga, the ego balloon burst. And with this balloon they are floating in the air. And deep in the earth. But as soon as the balloon burst, it just falls. There is also balloon of ridicule. That kind of things are the Jews which say we are chosen ones, Christians which say we are chosen ones and Muslims of course say we are chosen ones. All is like a fool's paradise. But in Sahaja Yoga one sees oneself and enjoys oneself. Also they see a little skill of alo. And they take lot of follow. We have to be free of this skill which gives ignorance. The controller has ego and condition in his Christ. Also we have two other great explanations of Buddha and Mahalaya who also control these two horrible enemies of human beings. But they don't know those who follow Buddha or those who follow Mahalaya. They don't know what they are following because they look some sort of rituals, nonsense type. Absurd is there. And the absurd is so much that if you see the earth after realization you just know how to stop laughing. It has been logical. God and His grace and His methods are absolutely perfect. There is logic behind it. Of course we can say the miracles He makes may not be understood by our human beings. But after the realization they understand everything. So the God's grace are the miracles for now going to man. But for the enlightened soul he understands. It's not after all his body. He's God Almighty. He can do whatever he has. This enlightened mind is the source of knowledge.

It is so simple now to give realization to thousands, especially Russians. They are very wonderful. Really the way they followed Christianity was very innocent and fearful and difficult. That's why they were always ready for Me to come and become such a nice. And if it was blossom time that I came here and all God's blessings. It is unbelievable that for a century you did not follow any religion. You did not talk of God. And suddenly now you become enlightened. It's heavenly. I will try to come to this country as long as I live. In this little lecture I don't know what to tell you. I am very happy to be here and say that you are great. Even Ramani has another place I don't know how the people are so alert. Your problems will be solved. I am sure. Satisfaction is the way achieve this solution. And the faith in yourself that you are surgeons. We have solved problems in many countries of many lives. Not me, I am saying the same thing. In the same way you all can work out the problems together. And the blessings of the Divine will show you that you are very clear to God. May God bless you.

Please put your hands towards Me. Now put the left hand towards Me and right hand on top of your head and bend your head. Now see if there is a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head. I said you have to forgive others and forgive yourself. Now put your right hand towards Me. And see if there is a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head. Forgive yourself and forgive others. Now last time put your left hand against your head properly. Something to get close, something to get quiet. Now please put both your hands towards Me. And watch Me without thinking. All those who are feeling hot or cool breeze in the fingers, finger tips or in the palm or out of the fontanel bone area, please raise your hand. Now put your hands towards Me. This is how you call this in India. Nothing surprising because they know what food and meals they know about Realization. But traditionally they know from ages they know. Then the most important thing is to get Self-realization in life. Nothing more important. But for two people it is critical. Very much critical. Now so many things happen after Self-realization.

My heart is full of beautiful waves of emotions. I see these sweet children grasping such a subtle understanding of Kundalini. Yet, you can feel the Kundalini pouring everywhere, so the Kundalini. It must be some great things, one failure. Yama-lalai, Sadho-lok, great Kundalini, is very failure. It is really beyond My widest meditation. When it's such a heartless place like the country, we have such beautiful lotus walls. I don't know the word of the Lord, but it is. To me it is a source of great deep joy. I don't know the word of the Lord, but it is. To me it is a source of great deep joy. Joy, our fear, is a joy. Your death, your understanding of the smile, is going to be full of places. I am sure it is on the back, on the whole back. So then it is the way you walk, which is all over the place of the Earth. I don't know. After seventy years of not knowing anything about the Earth, you people have selected the Andhosia of such a life. And you see, in great ancient times, that those people who are seeking God in human lives and in no return will find it. That prediction, I never knew that in the sham or in the yachting, in humanity is so clear. You know how much people respect the Earth. Because the fame of your love and your death and also your devotion, it knows all over the world, you see five words. They all create the name of the yachting, with great reverence and with their hands on their heart. You people are so holy and so beautiful, so healthy, so clean up. No one's there in the sky. Before in one place there is to be one saint. You see, saint. But now see, how many saints are seeking God. And how many saints are manifesting the place of the Earth. Such talents and self-expression or worthy, which is something extremely divine. All of My love, all My presence is for you. I don't know how to describe the joy of the Mother. There are such beautiful trees. I keep you all in My heart. You also keep Me in your heart. What's not to be the workings of one's betweenness? What is there to thank you when you are all part of the masses by God? It's a very unique relationship. I will always think of you whenever I may be, as My greatest. I am sure there will be also a start to this room and then have a very good education. May God bless you.

I don't know what to say because it's such a miracle, the whole thing is. First of all, we had Russian music and Russian people came up and they sang so well. I wish some of the Russians should understand that how they can master our great art. This little girl who went to India and she has shown such a great understanding and deafness. The way she sang, I mean, any great musician in India would be amazed that in such a short time that she was in India. She has picked up so well and the rhythm was perfect, her swaras were perfect, absolutely in tune and she sang like a great artist with so many permutations and combinations as we call them tan. I was really enamoured by her rendering and I would suggest other Russians also because there is a capacity of lot of creativity in them, you can see that. They should also go to India if you want, scholarship is possible and study music. If you have a good voice, you should not waste it. The second was the Romanians. I always felt that they were the people who are described in our Puranas as Gandharvas, means the celestial musicians. They are so remarkable in such a short time. Bhama told me that in a very short time they could sing very difficult raga so well within three and a half months time they could master a raga which takes at least six, seven years for Indians to do that. That shows they have a capacity, specially at this time they are born to learn this music, to master this music. The whole thing was absolutely amazing because when she started singing I thought some Maharashtrian girl is singing or what. So clear, so proper and so... the pronunciations were so correct. I mean if you ask somebody to sit outside and hear, they will be amazed that how could these foreigners who have never heard Indian music at all have become such experts, such good musicians. I mean it was a wonderful program this time. Then the Romanian gentleman who played the harmonium was also remarkable. I was surprised he got all the tilts and everything so clearly. Then the tabla wala was great. But the most amazing thing came from the last musician who sang for which Baba mama said the scholarship can be given. I mean he is a master, he has a beautiful voice. If he had somebody like this in India he would have scored such a big position. So I said there is something about these people, the people from Russia, Ukraine and specially Romani. They have a special talent that God has given them now because Indian music is not a cheap music, it is not easy. It is very difficult and people practice it every day for years together to get to this position while God has given you a special gift so you should utilize it as much as possible. I was really enamored. I mean I just don't know what to say. Anybody who knows Indian music would be really surprised at the achievement of these artists. First I thought they are Maharashtans or what the hell. They were singing so well. But it is surprising they are Romanians. So for all Russians and all the Eastern Bloc people I have to suggest that they should take advantage of this very great gift they have and at this time they can pick up their music very easily, you can see clearly. Now if even two, three people can go, can learn and come and teach others because they have a voice, they have that speciality in their voices which you find rarely in people and so I was really very much surprised and it was such a pleasant surprise. May God bless them all and I thank you all for coming over here for this program and I hope there will be more programs later on and we are all going to enjoy all of them. Thank you. We have tried to fix your weddings as much as we can but you see the choice was very little still. We have made lots of combinations. One thing I have to warn you also in the main lecture also I will tell you that you should not get involved with other Sahaja Yogis in your own centers, in your own country. That's very dangerous because if you start looking out for boys and girls like that your attention in Sahaja Yoga will be much lessened. In India we discourage. We discourage completely that you choose your own husband or wife specially from the same place. Also some people who came here they also have done this is to choose a boy for themselves or a girl for themselves. It's absolutely wrong against such because you have come here not for finding out a boy or a girl for yourself but for your spiritual ascent. At that time these things do not come in your mind that you should not try to select a boy or start looking at boys and the boys looking at girls. That is one is not permitted. If you start doing that like that it will become something else not Sahaja Yoga. So first thing is that you should come here with a clean heart that you are coming here to worship, to pray, to meditate and that you are not here for your marriages. That's not so important. What is important is how far you go spiritually and not that we should decide all your marriages but at least you should not decide because your decisions could be wrong and tomorrow you come and tell us this has happened, that has happened. Mostly such marriages have failed and we have had divorces with such marriages somehow or other, mostly and those who have failed are all such marriages where you have decided. In India we don't allow anybody who is from the same center to marry the person in the same center because it spoils the atmosphere, the serenity of the occasion. So please try to come here with a clean heart that you are going to worship and you are going to ascend. This has been a big problem. This time I have allowed. There are 13 such marriages and be careful. You have decided. I said all right if they have come all the way it's all right but this is the last time we'll never permit such a thing to happen again. All right, thank you.
