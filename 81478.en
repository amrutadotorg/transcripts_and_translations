She had a big smile; she was so happy. So she then said, "Right." First of all, I asked her if she got a passport. She said, "Right, go down to the Addis Ababa and get married. I'll come back in a couple of weeks, and then you can get married before me."

So, we got married at the Addis Ababa weekend. There I was on my wedding day in bed with my wife. That was living the dream.

What happened was, before I got married at the Addis Ababa, I went to see Shri Mataji with Devyani. She gave me the date of February the 13th. So I said, "Right, well, my wedding day will be February the 13th."

And she said, "No, but you're getting married tomorrow."

But I said to Mother, "Well, that's a matter of opinion." I was getting married at the Addis Ababa, but what I considered to be my wedding was my wedding before Mother. I never even looked at the marriage certificate, because I always keep my wedding anniversary as February the 13thâ€”the day I got married before Shri Mataji. That's how my wedding happened.

And as I say, they're very interesting dreams. The way you're spoken to through dreams is quite incredible. It's just reminded me of the whole thing about marriage.

When we first met Shri Mataji, we'd obviously all come from quite a liberated background, you could say. She was very anxious to re-establish Dharma and everything. So what she said to us was that you can't marry any other realized Sahaja Yogi, because they're your brother or sister. She said the only way, if you want to get married, you have to meet someone outside of Sahaja Yoga. Then they come and get realization as your fiance, and then you marry them.

We thought that sounded impossible, but Maureen actually did it.
