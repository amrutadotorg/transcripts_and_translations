 (England)
The first time we started getting somewhere was when this Indian guy turned up and started to teach us yoga. His name was Mukund Shah. He taught us a bit of Hatha yoga, a bit of Tai Chi, and a bit of TM. I heard somebody describe him as a "yoga playboy," which was a pretty succinct description because he'd been to several different things. It was suggested to him by another false guru in India that he come to teach yoga in England, and so he started teaching us.

Then he found out about Shri Mataji coming here. He went and saw her at the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan. Being somewhat skeptical, he decided to test it on us. He had this tiny little photograph, not much bigger than a postcard, and he said, "Look, I've met this woman who's a saint, and you get vibrations off her photograph. Would you like to try it?" He was teaching us in a sort of bank in that area, which they used as a community center. So we sat down, put our fingers out, and we all felt different sensations. What I felt was like a ball of ice; it felt spiky, but it was like a ball of ice melting in my hands.

We went to see Shri Mataji at the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan a couple of times. When the series of meetings finished there, she wanted somewhere else to go, so Mukund Shah invited her to come and stay where he was living. This was at Clare Court in Judd Street, opposite King's Cross Station. We had a few meetings there, and that's when you came along. That's where we met Shri Mataji.
