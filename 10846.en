Talk Language: English | Transcript (English) – Draft

This was really a very memorable night for all of you. I don't know what to say about Nishat Khan. I think he should be given now the title of Ustadh, no doubt about it. The way he has played, I have never heard anybody playing so well, never before. And specially Tapa. Because it's a very difficult, I have never heard anyone playing Tapa on sitar.

Once only, Sideshwari Devi, as I told you, she sang before Me this Tapa raga. She was quite an old lady at that time. But I was amazed, she sang it so well and she was a master. And I also call her, "You are an Ustadh", I call her that.

That's what I feel now today, the way you have really entertained all of them. Also, they appreciate and understand music, that's the best part of it. You see, all these people who are sitting here, I know them. You would have played till 5, 6 o'clock, they would have sat here. It's a present to them. For they are serving a great purpose. My father was a great connoisseur and supporter of musicians. And always used to say, "You must always respect artists because they are specially chosen by God. If they don't go to the wrong path, then they have to be very much respected. And you must do everything that is possible to express your respect". So, one day, he told me, "My desire is that the whole world should know about our classical music. That's all I want. Because this is our greatest sampada". It means, the property?
Babamama: Heritage.
Shri Mataji: Heritage and the property. Inherited property of our country. "And no country has this. This is something so great. And this should be used to convey the blessings of God. Also, I have seen vibrations flow much better when there is music on. With the music, so many vibrations start just, it's like some puja or aarti, I don't know what it is, but music has this power".

So, this was his desire and I also found that for Sahaja Yoga, our Indian music is going to help a lot. Now all kinds of music styles are coming up, but I have seen once they hear the Indian music, they don't want to hear anything else. That is for definite. But there have been some very great composers, no doubt. But the way these days the music is on, I think the speedy music as you have played today will really break their heads and they'll understand what Indian music is.
I was very happy that you could come, because these musicians mostly come in Guru Puja. So, they must also have somebody here of your repute, of your great achievements, before them, and to hear them in this atmosphere. But today definitely, something had happened to you, I think, much more than before. And as you told Me that in my presence something happens to you, I could see that today very much. I hope your fingers are not cut. They are all right.
[Laughter]

So this is how we understand each other better. Now when music is played we forget all our boundaries, all our stupid ideas, just become one with each other. Music is really some divine gift and it should be always encouraged very much. I have to also congratulate the hosting countries of Italy and also of India, that in such a short time, they have done so well about this building up, this new place and new thing. Very well done, I must thank them very much for this. Otherwise, in such a short time, to do it, in Guru Puja always it happens like that.

We bought a new house just on Guru Poornima. We lived it here, and everything works out on Guru Puja, some or other that something has to happen. Like Cabella also, I bought five days before Guru Puja. Second day, I bought, third day, I paid and fifth day, the program was here. So, this time also, same thing. As in Guru Puja time, there is something special that you go to something better, and have some sort of a big activity and that has happened. And I must congratulate Italians, also Indians. But I don't know how much Indians have contributed to that. But their music is there.

And also the way you had the drama like professionals, very good drama, and all the programs also very, very good. Sicilians very, very good with their music. I enjoyed that music very much. And also all other programs that you had of, say, Kuchipudi is amazing that people from Western countries should do Kuchipudi so well. It's a very fast, very fast dance, very fast dance. And another did Bharatanatyam. And all these things to be done by people from Western countries is remarkable, I tell you, and so well. I mean, I can't understand how is the nucleus has shifted from India to Western countries. Now our Indian girls are not learning these dances, and you are becoming such experts. Something special is happening in the West I think, that you all have picked up all these things.
It's very creditable that you understand also Indian music, because it's a very difficult thing to understand and to appreciate. And a new audience we have to prepare for this understanding of this music, very important. In our country, nowadays, people are not so serious about classical music. But if it goes back from western countries, they'll start appreciating it.

So, I hope you all have enjoyed all the music and everything, and tomorrow is the puja. I think we can start at about seven tomorrow, it's all right if you can all be awake.
[Laughter]
Tomorrow morning, I would like to see about, say, twelve o'clock, people whom I have to give some money, and who, I'll send word for them who have to see Me. But otherwise, Monday morning, I'll be free if you want to come and see Me. I hope you are all not very sleepy and you go and enjoy now. The morning is already there, and the moon must be shining. The moon was on the ninth, there was the Guru Puja, really Guru Purnima. But according to our convenience, we have had this.

I'm very happy, really very happy, because all these things are coming up at the end of the century.

Now this picture you have shown here behind, is the picture that this scientist has talked about, that these are all the vibrations coming out of Mother's body that she has infinite source. She's the source of the Divine and cosmic Power. She said so. But actually, ‘Sitting in the heart of the universe’ is not this one. It’s another one when, in London, they were singing the song ‘Sitting in the heart of the universe’. All kinds of, all hearts, you know, all designs of heart came with light. And that is what should have been under this, or change the other one, one of the two, would be a better idea.

So, I mean, this also very unique that I met this scientist there. And the scientist, really, I felt, was very shy about the whole thing. He was describing Me as the source of cosmic energy and he's verified it with all kinds of equations and geometry and also algebra, which I have studied long time back. But I was amazed at this man the way he reached the conclusion. Of course, you know that. But that if scientifically it is proved, then we'll have no problem. And this is a very big thing also, [at] this Guru Puja, this has happened. So tomorrow we'll have the Puja about seven o'clock, I'll be here.
Thank you very much. Good night.
Thank you.

Sahaja Yogi: Mr. Middha from Austria. Can you please come to the stage?
[This is a request to the Italians to move a car and other tasks.] The dinner will be served in about 15 minutes in the usual place.
