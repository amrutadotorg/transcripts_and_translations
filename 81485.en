Mentioning Caxton Hall again, there's another thing that has come up. Do you remember how we used to go from Caxton Hall to the Spaghetti House? That was always the thing. At least once a month, Mother would come back with us. But another one of the really amazing ones I remember from that is when we all went to McDonald's. Mother was with us—there's a big McDonald's in Victoria, just in front of the church, just up the road from where Mother lives. We all sat out there having McDonald's. Mother as well; it was quite incredible.

She always had a fillet of fish. And ever since then, whenever I've been to a McDonald's, I've had a fillet of fish. And a strawberry milkshake? Yes, and a milkshake.

One of the early things I remember, being at Ashley Gardens—myself and, I think, Pat as well, used to go there and help out. It seemed very strange to me at first because there was Mother, sitting there drinking a milkshake, eating a fillet of fish, and sleeping on the floor.

"Sleeping on the floor?"

Sleeping on the floor. Well, Mother could sleep anywhere, but it just seemed very strange to me that she should sleep on the floor. She did it in Donatel Ashram a couple of times. We would all be sleeping around on the floor with her.

"What was it like sleeping when Mother was there and you were all sleeping together?"

After being there, you just feel this amazing golden purity and relaxation. It was 24 hours. Once, she took a flat for a short while behind Harrods, and we all slept on the floor. She slept on a sort of chaise-longue thing. I woke up in the morning feeling her touch my Agnya there with her Agnya finger. I opened my eyes and she was sat across the room. There was no way she touched me, but that's how I woke up. You were always in that heightened state.

I remember that time... sorry, Doug, just before I forget, in 160 North Gower Street, we used to spend hours and hours clearing out. We'd all sit in a row. Someone would have their hand on Shri Mataji and we'd all touch each other, with one hand out the window. It used to go on for hours and hours. I remember one night it went on so long we all fell asleep. I woke up and we were all still lying in this position. I had a really stiff neck. I looked up and it was about four o'clock in the morning. Shri Mataji was still sitting where she was, quite alert. And she said, "Ready? Carry on." And so we had to carry on.

That's the sofa in the first Daddy Guru picture, where the flowers are between Mother's feet. It went into a sofa bed. She laid on there, and we all laid on the floor.

When Pat gave Mother the roses, do you remember? Yes, I gave her the roses. I suddenly said, "Oh, Shri Mataji, I've forgotten to take the thorns off." And she said, "That's all right. I have to take the thorns with the flowers." She was talking about us, I guess.
