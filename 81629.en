 (England)
It's very nice to have you both this morning, on the 20th of July 2023, to remember and recount the times you had with the Adi Shakti herself, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi. Pat is one of the first of the seven Sahaja Yogis in England, in the United Kingdom, in the Western world, that Shri Mataji took as her devotee, as a disciple, as a child.

Could you please tell us when, where, and how you met Shri Mataji and how you got your realization? Briefly, please.

Well, they both took place at the same time. I met Shri Mataji in London in a block of flats called Clare Court near King's Cross, in Judd Street, one Sunday afternoon. I heard that a Yogi lady was going to be visiting somebody I knew, a Hatha Yoga teacher, so we went to see Shri Mataji then. I had no idea what to expect at all. I walked in the room and was completely blown away. I felt as if I'd just been on a jungle path and walked into a broad, royal highway full of light.

The other thing that struck me was that Shri Mataji was telling somebody off quite forcibly. That surprised me because I expected it to be all meditative and quiet. Instead, I got thrown into this thing where I found myself thinking, "This is what it must have been like to meet Christ preaching in the market somewhere." It was just this incredible authority and extraordinary personality.

Mother worked on me and said I was sick and needed all kinds of things done. A few other things happened, but basically, I must have gotten my realization then, although I had problems. Mother worked on me for quite a while. I had problems with my sensitivity from the Vishuddhi, so I experienced all kinds of extraordinary things. I don't know whether I felt the vibrations clearly. That was my first experience and my realization all in one, really.

I have some photos to share. Do you want us to share those photos at this point?

Perhaps a bit later. Let's go through the questions first.

Okay. So your first meeting with Shri Mataji was all-encompassing—the light and the love, which was quite stern from what we gather. And you felt that this is how Jesus would have been in the market, full of people who probably weren't on the path to what he was saying. I heard earlier that you had something like six months... I mean, physically you were in a very, very bad state at that point. Is that right?

Yes. Mother said she thought I had six months to live. I knew I was in a bad state, but I was so fixated on seeking the truth that I didn't really pay much attention to that. I was just busy trying to go ahead in all directions, I suppose you could say.

That was, I think, in September 1975. Mother stayed there for two or three months with us, and all kinds of things happened.

When you say you stayed with Shri Mataji, where is this that you stayed with her?

Well, she used to come and meet us in this house in North Gower Street in Euston. After Mukund Shah's place—we were there for one meeting—we went to her house a couple of times as well in Oxted, in Hurst Green. I suppose I spent time with Mother on about half a dozen occasions before she went to India. She was abroad for several months, and then she came back and we just went back to where we'd been before and carried on. That was for most of 1976; we were with Mother in various places, in her house and also in the house in Euston, and various other places, including on the tube, apparently.

You were with her practically 24/7, from the sound of it.

On occasions, yes. We slept at Mother's house. We would be up all night, all day, and Mother would be telling us stories and we'd be asking questions. She'd be working on us. It went on and on. All sorts of things happened, but I can talk about some of those with some of the other questions that you have.

If I may, I'd like to ask about some of the wisdom that you learned from those stories that stand out for you, even now.

Well, there are so many things, aren't there? I could describe experiences I had which would give you an idea of what it was like. Most of these things are in my book, Expecting to Fly.

The second time I went to Mother's house in Hurst Green, my heart chakra was catching, apparently. I felt very uneasy, my heart was beating erratically, and I couldn't relax. It was very different from how I'd felt before. Almost immediately, she looked at me and said, "Your heart's catching. Come here. Kneel down." Then she closed her eyes.

I immediately saw this image of an Arabian-looking lady, made out of vibrations, like pixels on a TV screen. A very dignified, very powerful lady with her head covered. It looked sort of Arabic to me. Then it glided forward and sort of stood over me, this image. I recognized the image immediately; I knew it was the Virgin Mary. And I knew it was an archetype, but I had no idea how I knew that. I just felt frightened, and I felt that she's not human. This is too much.

So I looked down at Mother's feet, and I could see her feet, like an x-ray vision, with this beautiful energy flowing through the bones of her feet. I thought to myself, "This is what Christ's feet must have looked like when he was walking on the earth." Then my attention, my consciousness, went down into her feet, and they became huge, hollow tunnels full of light. I went into these tunnels and felt completely secure, relaxed, and quite blissful.

Then I came back to myself and found I was still kneeling in front of her. Her eyes were open, and she was smiling at me. At that point, I felt this incredible sense of something awakening in me, something really, really ancient, all coming back together. It was very, very powerful, and it was getting stronger and stronger. My sister, who was watching me, said I looked like a flower opening up to the sun. Then she sort of went, "Oops, too much," and kind of pushed me back down again. I felt a bit annoyed about that for a moment, but then I knew I didn't deserve anything like that. I wasn't in any fit state to experience something like that. But then I realized this thing in my heart had gone, and I felt completely relaxed and very blissful.

Things like that were happening. That was probably the most powerful, the most magical experience that happened in those early days. But there was stuff like that happening all the time.

Another time, I was just sitting with Mother at her dining room table, and she was just talking to me. I suddenly saw that she was the Primordial Mother and that she had all these divine weapons all over her, which were a bit like flowers. And they were all neatly tied off, as if they weren't needed. They weren't to be used. She was just using vibrations and Sahaja Yoga techniques.

Lots of things like that. I kept jumping from extraordinary experiences to feeling really bad all the time. We were asking all kinds of stupid questions, I guess, because we didn't know anything. We were ignorant. Mother would answer them all. And I gradually got this picture of the instrument, the deities, the chakras, the Virata. I started to see the extent of the canvas that Mother was working on. It was vast. I sort of knew who she was, but not in detail, and I just filled in the details as time went on. I just knew she was like Christ and that this was something extraordinary, something completely new.

But she made you feel completely relaxed. Normally, for the first 20 minutes or so in her presence, I'd feel super hyper-aware of all the problems I had inside me. It's like those big searchlights. And then, gradually, I would feel the Kundalini pushing up through my body, and aches and pains dissolving, until suddenly, I would just feel very relaxed and fine, and often like a child. To begin with, I was trying to be cynical, trying not to just accept it all blindly, but to understand what was happening.

In India, you grow up with this knowledge about the deities and the chakras—not so much the Kundalini, of course—but there is a sense of recognition in the heart. When did the penny drop for you about who Shri Mataji is? With these absolutely outstanding, extraordinary, magical moments where you see so much light and love, the peace, the joy—when did the penny drop for you?

As I said, I didn't have that background knowledge. I knew something about chakras, and I'd had some experience of chakras and Kundalini in my seeking. Mother told me later that I was born with my Kundalini awakened. I wasn't realized, but she said Christ awakened people’s Kundalinis when he was here. It made you more sensitive; your Kundalini could go up to the Agnya, but you weren't realized.

So, I had this kind of gut recognition that, "Well, this is it." But I didn't know what it was. It was a matter of filling in the detail and trying to fit it into some of my other ideas I'd gotten from reading books and all kinds of things. Sometimes it was confusing. Sometimes I reacted against things Mother said because I was basically a hippie. I believed... well, it's basically hedonistic, but in an idealistic way. It was the idea that we didn't know how to open our hearts and be natural because we were too damaged and suppressed. So we were trying to open up to everything in a pretty stupid way. Some of it was a bit difficult.

I kept having these religious experiences with Mother, which I couldn't understand because they didn't fit into my ideas at all.

Can you share one of those religious experiences you had with Mother?

Like when I first went in and thought, "This is like Christ teaching in the marketplace." I thought, "Why am I referring to Christ in a classical, almost religious way?" I knew Christ Consciousness existed, and I knew it was in everybody, potentially. I wasn't sure whether Christ was the ultimate, the primordial Christ who had come on earth, or whether it was just somebody who had experienced Christ Consciousness. So that's where I was at the time.

But I kept having these religious kinds of reactions, and feeling like a little child. And this goody-goody stuff, it seemed to me, was like the sort of stuff my parents wanted—for you to be well-behaved and neat and all that, which we took years trying to get rid of. I just kept feeling like that and questioning it, trying to figure it out.

The most amazing thing is that Shri Mataji actually told you and the other yogis who were there with you personally everything about Sahaja Yoga. You spent so many days and nights with Shri Mataji at her house. Could you recount a typical day and night for us?

Not really, because it was always different. For instance, sometimes Mother would cook for us. We used to eat huge meals and then all fall asleep for a couple of hours in the afternoon in lots of comfortable armchairs. It would just go on—talking, explaining, and us asking questions. It just went on all the time.

At one stage, later on, we were doing some work in the house as well, some painting and decorating, sanding things down. Mother came and joined in, helped us do it. She'd just be sanding a windowsill or something and chatting to us. It just went on all the time. One day, she took us out into her back garden and got some water and washed our feet, just like Christ did. That was almost impossible to bear. I just felt so unworthy and so astonished. But she just did that.

With my sister, Maureen, she slept with her upstairs sometimes because Maureen was worried about various things. She can tell all those stories. But we just did everything together, really. C.P. would go off somewhere on a tour for his work, and Mother would sort of ring us up and say, "The house is free, quick, come over!" And we'd come over for the weekend and stay.

Sometimes we'd be at the house in Euston, North Gower Street, and sometimes in other places. And we'd often stay the night, sleep on the floor. It was so informal, and yet it was so profound. And it was so familiar, somehow. It was just timeless. You didn't feel like it was part of normal life at all. A lot of it, I kept feeling that I was inside the pages of a Bible, and it was just a biblical story taking place all around me. And it seemed quite normal, somehow. Certainly, it was very relaxing. It just seemed natural.

How does it feel now when you look back?

Well, I wish I could have been in a better state to fully appreciate it. I think I said in my book, it was like looking at a fantastic meal through a window when you're starving, and you're not able to reach it fully and touch it and taste it. I was in various states. Mother would do all sorts of things to clear me out. One day, I came back all caught up, and she made me bow down at her feet. She took her shoe and she beat my Kundalini, quite forcibly.

Physically? She beat your Kundalini?

Absolutely. Hard enough for me to see stars. It didn't have a heel. She must have known it was going to happen. Anyway, she did it, and it worked really well. Cleared me out amazingly. It was brilliant. Another day, she took a big jar of oil and gave me a head massage with oil for ages. I mean, we were so spoiled.

I knew we were. I kept feeling we were like kids. I remember feeling, "I hope we don't have to grow up too quick," because the amount of attention we got was really nice. She was asking us questions a lot of the time because she wanted to know what we'd been doing in our seeking and what problems we'd had. That was quite a common thing. And she was obviously quite horrified by a lot of the things we had to say.

She was just like your mother. We were relaxed. We didn't really find out anything about protocol until we went to India about a year later. That would be early 1977, in January. Most of 1976, we spent with Mother in her house and in various places. There were a few seekers coming now and then, but mostly there weren't. I think she had enough problems on her hands, so she just concentrated on us. It was incredible. It seems like a dream, a happy dream, now in a way.

You Sahaja Yogis of that time, the beginning of Sahaja Yoga, were actually the foundation and continue to be the foundation, even in our generation.

Well, she wanted us to feel responsible, I guess. We were, in a way, because she was finding out. In almost any situation I'm in now, I can look at it and just remember what it felt like to be in her presence, and I somehow know what Mother would have said about it. That's the way I feel. It was kind of ingrained in me, almost on a molecular level, because so many things happened and so many things were talked about.

Could you elaborate on that, please? The "molecular level" is fantastic. How does it manifest on a day-to-day basis?

It doesn't manifest, it's just like that. I just remember what it was like to be in Mother's presence, and I just look at a situation and I instinctively feel the sort of thing Mother would have said about it. That's all. It's just something which has rubbed off. But it was intense, and it went on for a long, long time. We spent days and days with Mother over months.

Even after that, when we were in India, we went to Nepal halfway through and stayed with Mother at Gregor's house for a week and had that kind of intensive time as well. Of course, in India, we tried to stay at the back and give the Indian yogis a chance to be with Mother.

We were there for three months on that first tour. When we went back to England, Mother came back in March or April or something. Then we had another few months during the summer until the first Caxton Hall meeting, which took place again around September, I think. At the end of the summer, anyway.

So, 1977, roughly we are talking about.

Seventy-seven. And that was quite frightening.

Frightening?

Yeah, because apart from anything else, Mother made us all sit on chairs around her on the stage. That was horrendous because I just felt all the stuff Mother was doing on the Kundalini working through my body, and I was just in agony. And I was trying to look all serene and evolved! I was just thinking, "Oh my God, I can't take this."

There were about 200 people who must have come, something like that, in Caxton Hall. At the end of it, Mother just suddenly took off from the stage, went down the steps, and was working on the people in the crowd. We just came down with her, and everything changed in that one program. Sahaja Yoga completely changed gear. From just a few people with Shri Mataji, we started inviting them to come to the ashram in Golders Green. Suddenly, there were 70 people instead of six or seven. It changed. Then it was similar to what we'd gone through, with people asking questions and Mother working on people. But the early couple of years were really something unbelievably special.

So what was it like watching movies with Mother? I know you mentioned she would cook for you. What about watching movies, going on picnics with her? I mean, there were serious times when she was clearing you all out and evolving you at the subtle level, but on the face of it, what was it like when you would do lighter things?

We didn't watch movies much. Once, we were watching Some Water Margin, which we were fond of in those days. It was about all these great souls reincarnated in China to fight the baddies, basically. And Wonder Woman, we used to watch that. Mother said we could watch it if we wanted. She came and watched Wonder Woman with us, and halfway through, she turned to us and said, "You know who the real Wonder Woman is, don't you?"

Stuff like that. We didn't go and watch movies very much. It was just intense talk and working. Mother used to work on us for a long period. We used to spend maybe two hours with our head on her feet, each person, while she worked on our Kundalini. We've spent hours forming chains with Mother working.

I was going to ask you about the treatments that Shri Mataji would have told you about. She's clearly clearing yogis at that time.

What were the different techniques that She had used?

Nothing much in those days. It was pretty simple. It was mainly foot soaking and shoe beating. The first time She showed me shoe beating, She used her shoe and did it on the floor. I suddenly saw this beautiful view of outer space with the Earth hanging there, and Mother was beating the whole Earth with her shoe. It kept flashing into these visions.

Another time, I was just sitting in the room, not feeling anything much, feeling pretty awful. Mother was talking, and then suddenly, I was floating on a lotus on this ocean. And there was this gale of wind flowing right through the room, jumping from one thing to the other. Wow. Many, many things were happening.

There were six of us, so other people were asking things, talking about things, having things to talk about. The first Pujas we had in our house, Mother brought an Indian chap named Satpal, who was a pujari of some sort. She gave him Realization, and he conducted the Pujas. Mother just told him what to do. He would go through his routine, and occasionally, Mother would correct him, saying, "Do this, do that, do the other."

When it came to the Aarti, we had a record from a movie where the old Aarti used to play, "Om Jai Jagdish Hare." We used to put that record on, play that, and clap, and that was the Aarti. And we'd have one piece of Prasad each, not the fifteen platefuls that everyone gets these days. It was amazing. Mother would explain the Pujas.

On one occasion, when we had the ashram after the Caxton Hall program, we were going to do a Havan out in the garden. Mother was trying to find out if somebody could read the Sanskrit names out. Nobody could do it. So, Mother said, "Well, there's nothing for it. I'll just have to worship myself." And She read the names.

But Pujas could be quite long. There were no bhajans, of course; that came a long time later. Mother taught us the mantras, and we'd use the mantras.

Interviewer: What were the long Pujas like? Could you please describe one for us? I've heard this before, that Pujas would be very long. What would they entail?

Pat: Mostly, it was because Mother had to explain everything and do everything Herself. She had to arrange everything and say, "Bring that here, and bring this there, and go and get that thing. Now do this." But we used to do Havans in those days, and they used to be done after the Puja. We used to do the whole thousand names with the English translation, so the Havan would take four hours. In fact, that happened to Grishna on her first visit to the ashram. She had no idea what to expect. She found herself first in a Puja and then in a four-hour Havan. The Havans were very long, but there was a lot to work out. We had all kinds of problems.

Interviewer: Indeed. Can I ask Grishna at this point, what was it like for her? You mentioned her first visit to the ashram. Perhaps your first meeting with Shri Mataji, Grishna?

Grishna: You want me to talk about my realization?

Interviewer: Yes, coming to Sahaja Yoga.

Grishna: Oh, okay. It was a little bit different from Pat's experience because there were already many people in Sahaja Yoga. I came to Caxton Hall. Somebody gave me the address, and I came to Caxton Hall and I saw Shri Mataji in a white sari, sitting on the stage. There were these two tall Indian lamps burning on each side of her, and she looked so majestic and so amazing. You could feel this power coming from her. The whole atmosphere in the room was very still.

And she spoke. Even now, I remember the talk. She was talking about the oysters. Some oysters from the sand go to the sea, and some of them manage to reach the sea, but some of them don't. And then She was saying, "I wonder which oysters you are." And I was wondering about myself, what kind of seeker I am.

But before coming to Caxton Hall, I already had an experience of spiritual awakening in Poland. I had cycled to the lake at five o'clock in the morning. The lake was still, the sun was going up, and it was very peaceful. I just stretched on the ground, as I was quite tired. And suddenly, the whole of nature was inside me. I just felt like a completely different person. I was not a person, really. I felt I was part of God's creation, and I knew it was God's creation. So, I came home and I said, "God exists." I was an innate atheist at the time.

Several times after that, I experienced thoughtless awareness and very different things, and everything started to go right in my life. From the moment of that experience, I was able to come to England. I was consciously looking for something because I joined different meditation groups, I was practicing Hatha yoga, doing all kinds of things.

When I came to Caxton Hall, I was looking for someone who could give me a continuation of this experience that I'd had, which I didn't find in any other seeking groups. She asked us to put our hands out and to get our Realization. I felt like a fountain opening from the base of my spine, going up my spinal cord and coming out of my head. It was so strong, it was just... whoosh. It was just amazing. I felt incredible and it was just overwhelming. Because I'd had these different experiences before, I knew this was it. I didn't really know who Shri Mataji was at that point, but I knew I belonged to her. Organically, I belonged to her.

Then I went to her feet because everybody was queuing, so I was queuing. I think I kneeled down, because that's what people were doing. And I was smiling, and Shri Mataji was smiling. Because I was doing Hatha yoga, I felt this pain in my heart. I wasn't talking to Shri Mataji about the experience of this amazing fountain, because to me it was obvious, but I was concerned about the pain in my heart. I said I felt this, and Shri Mataji said, "No, it's okay. Your problem is here." And She said, "You catch colds?" I said, "Yes." She said, "You will be okay soon." I must say, I'm still working it out, but "soon" is very relative for God.

And actually, because I was smiling, Shri Mataji said, "You are such a joyful person." I didn't think I was joyful at the time, but I think I must be.

Interviewer: It really is important, that sense of peace and the sense of joy.

Grishna: Absolutely, completely. Two weeks later, I ended up in the ashram. I arrived there and didn't know what to expect. Everybody was looking at me, wondering who I was. I just thought, "Well, I'll sit at the back." But Shri Mataji called me to do the Puja.

Interviewer: That's your first Puja experience? Amazing.

Grishna: Yes. Because Shri Mataji would call new people, people who had never done the Puja before. It was very quick. She was not concerned about when the people came to Sahaja Yoga or how many weeks or months they were meditating. She would just call people to do her Puja. So, I did that. I washed her feet.

And then Shri Mataji called me to do the Havan. As Pat was saying, the Puja maybe started at 10 o'clock, but the Havan was very long. So, I was sitting in the Havan and doing the Havan. It was after the Puja. We were doing it in a fireplace... no, it was outside.

Pat: It was just outside the French windows.

Grishna: I know where I was sitting. It was May, actually, the beginning of May. You know, pretty cold. So, anyway, my legs were going a little bit, and I was thinking, "Maybe I should get up." But I kept sitting because I couldn't just stand up in the middle of the Havan. I didn't know what it was, but I felt I had to be there. But I was quite used to sitting on the floor because I used to do Hatha yoga.

After about four hours, the Havan was over, and we had a music program. There was an Indian musician who came, and it went on for a long time. By 10 o'clock in the evening, we left. And I felt amazing. I mean, I felt really amazing.

Interviewer: Do you remember the musician?

Pat: No, I don't think we've seen the musician again.

Grishna: I don't know. In those days, I was quite new in the country. My English was okay, but it was not amazing. So, everything was just sort of a little bit blurred. If you are a foreigner in another country and you still don't quite understand what people say, you feel like a child. I was still in that kind of state.

And then, of course, later on, I was following Shri Mataji everywhere She went. Sometimes, I would travel in Shri Mataji's car. We would sit in the back. During that time, in 1980, there were many public programs around the country, so I was going to all these public programs. I was just taken there, somehow. For me, it was just an amazing adventure, non-stop with Shri Mataji.

At the second public program I attended with Shri Mataji in Caxton Hall, I was just sitting there, and Shri Mataji looked at me and She said, "Why are you sitting down? You have to welcome people." So, I was shown what to do, and I could see everything. I was quite amazed. And I think this is something that we really need to do with new people. They really need to get engaged straight away.

Interviewer: To see that they actually have their own powers.

Grishna: Yes, the experience is so important. To experience their own powers. Because then, I couldn't have enough of it. Each time I worked on people, my Kundalini used to go up pretty high.

Interviewer: Could you recount for us—and I address this question to both Pat and yourself, Grishna—the most profound miracles that you experienced? Because I guess when you're with Shri Mataji, you're sort of on air, in a special zone. Do you have any miracles that you'd like to share? Pat, first?

Pat: For me, I had quite a lot of miracles, but they were mostly inner experiences. The most profound one took place after I had an incredible, powerful dream that I met the angel of death, the Grim Reaper. He was this huge warrior angel, wearing battered armor covered in blood. A very serious guy. He took my hand and said, "You have to say goodbye to everyone." So, I said goodbye to everyone. And he said, "Very good," and gave a very slight smile. Then I woke up and I thought, "Oh God, I'm going to die."

But what happened was, a couple of days later, I had this unbelievable experience. I got out of my car to visit a client to do a central heating survey. Suddenly, the Kundalini came up through my body. It was so wide, it seemed wider than my body. And it just went straight up. And then, bang. I was floating in the air above myself. Somehow, I still carried on with the work. I went into the house, met the woman, and I was going around measuring and stuff. And my real self was above my head, floating, smiling, and looking at everything all around the rooms, around the ceilings. This poor woman kept looking up behind herself and above herself, very furtively. She knew something was happening, but she didn't know what.

This went on for several days, and it all culminated in an experience that took place at work. We had a big, open-plan office. I was just sitting there, drawing up some plans, and I went into this really profound state of complete silence. It just got deeper and deeper. I just started feeling my whole human personality dissolving. It was like pulling the thread on a jumper; the jumper was just disassembling itself. And less and less of me was there. But I wasn't in the slightest bit worried. I loved it. I just wanted to dissolve more and more and more until I just became this completely clear vessel, like one made of glass, with the Kundalini, the Holy Spirit, flowing right through the center in complete silence.

And then I just, some last bit surrendered, and I felt something unwind in my head. Suddenly, Shri Mataji just seemed to download Herself into my being. For a moment, I was Shri Mataji, just full of light and power. And I just knew so many things. My chakras and Kundalini just went into action so powerfully, they were just doing such extraordinary things that I got frightened. I thought, "What's going to happen to all these people around me in the office?" And I kind of jumped out of the state and was just sitting there at my desk, completely stunned.

That was the high point. That's the most miraculous thing I ever experienced. It's like, if you can completely surrender the ego and superego, your human personality, and completely dissolve, then you become a perfect instrument for your Mother to work through. And so the ultimate goal of Sahaja Yoga is staring you in the face at every moment. All you have to do is surrender, to completely dissolve yourself in thoughtless awareness.

Interviewer: Amazing. Wow. Grishna, would you like to share an experience?

Grishna: How can I match this? There is no match. It's actually amazing how you articulated your experience, Pat. I'm quite stunned. Okay, I have three experiences.

When Pat was talking about Shri Mataji's feet... they are very powerful, as Shri Mataji tells us. But if people are new and didn't experience it, they don't know how powerful they are. In one of the Pujas, we used to go and put our head on Shri Mataji's feet, and She would just work on our vibrations. It used to be after the Puja, we would go to Shri Mataji's feet to pay respect and somehow She was clearing us out.

In one of the Pujas—that was the Puja when we made the first Indian-style crown for Shri Mataji, and She liked it, and I was very happy—I went to Shri Mataji's feet. I'm approaching Mother's feet and they are immaculate. They are made of alabaster. They are totally pure. Immaculata is the name that we give Shri Mataji. Completely pure. Her feet are like that. Her feet are in a different dimension. No human being can touch those feet. I couldn't, really. I just bowed down in complete awe.

Shri Mataji creates this illusion that they are just normal feet, so we go without any hesitation. But they are not normal. This is the Mahamaya form of Shri Mataji. It's absolutely amazing. It's Mahamaya all the time. Sometimes Shri Mataji steps out from that and allows us, or maybe it just happens that She can't carry on with this human form. She steps out, and then we can see who actually is before us. Because sometimes we forget.

There was another experience with Shri Mataji's feet. We were looking after Sahaja Yoga in Devon, and Shri Mataji was going to have a TV interview. Before the interview, we did a little Puja. It was not to any specific deity; it was just washing her feet. We were washing the feet, and I could sense the vibrations coming. I could see the vibrations coming out from her toes. It was the strongest Puja that I remember, which was in 1983, maybe '82 or something like that.

So, there was the interview in Plymouth, which was very good. The TV crew at the television station got their Realization. There was a slot where they had nothing to do, and She gave them Realization. The person interviewing asked all the right questions, and it was really very nice.

And then She came... all in one day, She did the public program in the evening. She went back to Exeter for the public program. And the next day, She went to Bristol. So in one day, from Bristol, She came, did the Puja, went for the TV interview, came for the public program back in Exeter, and then went back to Bristol. I was getting a coach, and I still had the image of Mother's feet in my head. They were just there. I got on the coach, and the next thing I know, I'm in London. I have no recollection. I didn't go to sleep. Just Mother's feet in my head, and finished. It was a five-hour journey, and it was just... no time existed at all. She is beyond time.

Interviewer: Shri Mataji married you, Pat and yourself, Grishna. What was it like to be in her presence? Pat had mentioned he didn't know anything about protocols. Was it still quite nascent at that stage?

Pat: We were still learning, definitely. I'd say we only started to learn when we first went to India, but by then that was 1980, so we'd had a couple of years and had a bit of an idea.

There were two couples. We got married in Chelsea Road. Beforehand, I got a message from a yogi where I was working. He said, "Mother has suggested that you should marry Grishna. Would you accept?" I'd only met Grishna once. I didn't feel any desire to marry her, you know, I didn't feel, "Wow, this would be amazing." So I meditated on it, and I felt the presence of Mahakali in my left side and my right heart went cool. So I said, "Yes, okay, I will."

From Mother, She said, "Sorry, you didn't say yes spontaneously enough, so I have to think about it." After a week, it was all right. Basically, the yogis were all with Mother at David and Hester's place. I had to leave at a certain point to go to work, as I was working weekends at that point. So I didn't know whether I was going to get married to Grishna or not. I rang up from work later on to somebody who'd been there and said, "Did Mother say anything about Grishna's marriage?" And he said, "Yes, yes, She announced their marriage." I said, "Well, who to?" And he said, "I didn't catch that bit."

We had to have a long engagement because Grishna had a... the way she'd escaped from Poland, in the days of the Iron Curtain, was to get a friend to marry her from West Germany. So she could get out of Poland to visit, and then she shot over to London and started seeking. But she had to get divorced first, which was just a bit of an adventure in itself. That lasted for quite a few months. So, unusually, we got engaged and we didn't get married for several months, by which time we got to know each other quite well.

Interviewer: Grishna, would you like to tell your part of the story, please?

Grishna: Oh yes, my part of the story. Well, in real life, I was feeling quite insecure because I didn't know if I was going to be sent back to Poland. The English were very good because they said, "We are very happy to extend your visas and everything, but you have to extend your passport." The Polish authorities wouldn't do that, of course; they were communist authorities, so it was very difficult.

I had to have a marriage of convenience because for seven years I was trying to come to England and I couldn't get my passport. Anyway, even before I came to Sahaja Yoga, I tried to sort it all out, but the person that I married went to Kathmandu and disappeared, so nobody could really find him. That's another story.

Shri Mataji knew that I was feeling quite insecure. She would just hug me and kiss me every time she saw me. I thought it was normal, and when she stopped doing it, I was very unhappy. On the human level, she was such a good mother. She knew everything that I needed. So She just said, "Well, you need to get married anyway. What do you think about Pat?" Well, I thought he had good vibrations. Those days I used to go on vibrations. So I said, "It's okay, yes."

But every time I saw him and I would say hello, he wouldn't talk to me. He would just put his head down and look somewhere else. So I'm thinking, "This is not a good start."

Pat: I was waiting to find out whether I was marrying you or not!

Grishna: But anyway, I was quite surrendered. In the end, Shri Mataji asked me if it was still okay. This was in Hester's house, and there was this walk-in closet for clothes. Shri Mataji was in this walk-in closet, and She called me in there. She asked me, "So, is it still okay?" I said, "Yes, yes, Shri Mataji, it's still okay." So Shri Mataji announced the engagement. And then the next day, Pat came to see me with flowers. That was very nice. He was actually talking to me.

Pat: We got married in Chelsea Road. We were working on building the meditation room at the time, and it had no roof. In the evening, we just had to put some plastic over it and hang a few balloons.

Interviewer: Can I share the photos of your wedding? We have some. [Shows photos]

Pat: That's Mother doing up my turban. And that's the two of you.

Grishna: Me looking terrified.

Interviewer: How did it feel wearing all those beautiful clothes? You look lovely, both of you.

Pat: It was really good. Afterwards, none of the yogis had any money, hardly. Someone lent me his van to drive there after the wedding, which was in the evening. It was an old, battered builder's van, and it ran out of petrol near Baker Street at 11 o'clock at night. That's where we had our first argument. I refused to get out of the car wearing my turban, and Grishna said it wasn't auspicious to take it off.

Grishna: It's hilarious.

Pat: And then we flagged down a taxi. Grishna put her veil down so all you could see was this sort of veiled, Eastern-looking lady. The taxi stopped, Grishna jumped in, and he drove off. I had to chase after them. Eventually, he stopped, and we got a lift back to Douglas's. It was quite an interesting beginning.

Grishna: The whole thing was like this. On the day of the marriage, Shri Mataji was coming. I was thinking, "Shri Mataji is coming, there is no roof, it's a building site! What's going to happen?" I was getting ready across the road. Then somebody came three hours later saying, "The roof has arrived." Then somebody came four hours later to say, "It's looking like an Arabian tent, beautiful. All the walls are covered with carpets and saris." So it actually felt amazing and so nice.

Pat: What Mother said to us was, "Never let the sun go down on a quarrel."

Grishna: Ah, that's so important.

Pat: I always tried to follow that. Even though I was usually right, I would always apologize before the end of the day.

Interviewer: What was the thing that mattered most in this relationship? This isn't just a marriage of two individuals; it's something much more, isn't it?

Pat: Absolutely. The marriage is part of your spiritual journey, your spiritual ascent. It's very important. It's nothing to do with whether it suits you or it's the way you might want it. You have to make it work. I would never dream of trying to break a marriage that Mother had arranged. I mean, it was sacred to us. There's that strength, then. It's not just a matter of mutual attraction or something like that. It's just you have a partner in life who you can depend on, who you know is loyal. Grishna was just amazing. In no time at all... you know, I had my son Kevin from my first marriage, who was being looked after by my parents. And in no time at all, Grishna was going to his school, fighting for him to change subjects. She took it all very seriously and was brilliant. Always has been brilliant. We had the odd interesting row, of course, but never past sunset.

Grishna: Well, I used to be a teacher, so I was quite concerned about education. To begin with, it was challenging. We were struggling to find somewhere to live, and we lived in some ashrams to begin with. Then we were trying to arrange something for Pat's son so he could come and live with us. Luckily, we got an apartment quite quickly, and it was really great. I think it was very, very nice for me to have a family and to be settled, and to meet Pat's parents. They were very nice and well-traveled. The family was from Hong Kong, so it was not like they didn't like foreigners. I was very much accepted by the family, which was great.

The only thing I desired was to marry a good Sahaja Yogi, and Mother said, "He's a very nice person." So what else could I ask for? I must say that I'm really glad that I got married to Pat.

Pat: She was brilliant. We really had no money. We did get a flat from the council, but there were no carpets, no furniture. She'd come from Poland, where she had her own flat and a boat and all kinds of things, and it didn't faze her. She just got down to trying to make what she could with whatever we had.

Interviewer: From so many years of being Sahaja Yogis, married by Shri Mataji, is there any word of advice that you would have for the people watching and for the future generations?

Pat: It's a matter of working together and thinking of the other person. We have arguments, but they're quite balanced arguments. We don't really take them very seriously, I guess. We've always gotten on. We've always managed through very difficult times, and it's mainly been because the marriage is something more than just a marriage to us. It's part of... it's like saying, "Would you stop being a Sahaja Yogi?" You wouldn't. It's the same thing. I think if both parties are making an effort to make it work, there's no reason why it shouldn't work. Mother's attitude was basically that most people could marry anybody. I think she used to choose people who would work out each other's problems or support each other's weaknesses. It wasn't about this idea of finding this ideal partner. It was just someone, a partner in life, that you can depend on.

Grishna: For me, it's a responsibility that we have towards Mother and Sahaja Yoga to make the marriage work. We are all realized souls. I don't see why it is so impossible. Shri Mataji said it was a headache for her sometimes. She would match people and they were changing their minds, saying maybe this, and maybe no, maybe yes. She said to me, "There are ten people in the room and I have to match them. How can I find 'the one'?" It's quite impossible. She just thought anybody could marry anybody. You are together like two wheels in a chariot, and this is to bring forward the new generations. That's the most important thing, really. I think if we are all in our Sahasrara, we can be married to anybody. Yogis in the marriage, if they have problems, they need to meditate more, both of them. And try to have a go and don't give up straight away.

The young ones now have so much choice. It's very easy for them to do Sahaja Yoga. The vibrations are everywhere. When I came in 1980, there were hardly any vibrations. You'd go in the street and it was really heavy. All these Pujas, all these Havans, all these realizations over many years... we have vibrations everywhere. People get their Realization so easily. You can look at somebody, and they get their Realization. It wasn't like that before.

(A discussion over old photos commences)

Interviewer: So I have this photo that I'm sharing now. It's from the very early days, isn't it?

Pat: Yes, that's 1976, I would say, in Mother's back garden at her home in Oxted. That's me with the striped orange thing. That's Douglas. My sister Maureen is there in the lovely red dress. We'd obviously been doing some sort of a Havan or a Puja.

Interviewer: Tell us about this photo.

Pat: That was in '76. Mother took us to Weston-super-Mare for a seminar, all six of us. She had a relation, I think it was her niece, who had an Indian restaurant there. This was above the restaurant. Mother had been trying to make me smile because I was very serious in those days, quite badly damaged. That was the point where I just began to smile, so my sister took a picture of it. On another occasion when Mother wanted me to smile and I was being serious, she took two of her bangles off and hung them on my ears. It's impossible not to smile when that happens.

Interviewer: I also have some photos from Bordi I would like to share with you.

Pat: Okay, yeah. This must have been Bordi. That's where we went in the days before... that was our first India tour, yes. I remember I got very ill while I was there. We were living in little huts. I left the program, went to my hut, and tried to sleep. After a while, I heard this knocking on the door. I got up in my sleeping bag, hopped to the door, and opened it. And there was Shri Mataji, come to see how I was.

Interviewer: Here's this one. This is in Bhairava's garden in Kathmandu, where we spent a week with Mother. I was quite caught up in this photo. I kept getting ill around that time. She's looking just so beautiful.

Interviewer: This was another photo I took in Scotland. It's a bit naughty, really. Mother brought C.P. up to have a holiday, but actually to help work out problems for us vibrationally. We were at an abandoned meditation flying academy. Very naughty of me, I asked Mother if She'd hold the fishing rod. She wasn't really fishing; I just thought it would make an amazing picture. It was interesting because after She'd done that, She gave the rod back to us, and the whole of the huge great loch on the right... all across the entire surface, fish were jumping suddenly. Everywhere. Hundreds of them.

Interviewer: It's good to know the story behind this photo because it's a very well-known photo of Shri Mataji.

Pat: And then She kept doing that. We weren't going anywhere in particular, and at each roundabout we lost half a dozen cars that all went the wrong way. In the end, there were four or five cars that arrived somehow at Stonehenge.

Interviewer: What was it like when you filmed the video walking around Shri Mataji's first house in England many years later?

Pat: It would be very nice to see. Yes, Grishna, and I think a couple more of you... Maureen was there probably, and Gregoire and his wife, with Andy and John and Francis when you filmed this, wasn't it? Yes, many years later we went back and walked around there. That was an amazing journey of Sahaja Yoga with you, Pat and Grishna, and your times with Shri Mataji. Really so special.

Pat: I remember the second time Gregoire had come. The whole room where Mother was was full of hippies, and they were all arguing with Mother about drugs. Gregoire appeared halfway through that. He walked in in this kind of white safari suit with a bow tie, and hurriedly whipped the bow tie off and shoved it in his pocket when he saw all the people in the room. Anyway, they were all arguing about drugs and everything. A couple of times before, I'd seen her commanding such spiritual power, I was just in awe. Yet when these people were just refusing to agree with her, she just wrapped her arms around herself and hugged herself. I just felt it was like a mother with her children who didn't know what to do because she couldn't force them. So I just said, "Okay, I'll stop." There was this dead silence, and all the hippies glared at me. I got quite annoyed. I thought I should be free to do whatever I wanted. But anyway.

Grishna: Shri Mataji was doing it... when people have memories of her looking after them and giving presents... She would just give us presents. Many people got presents later on, and she would buy us clothes. Oh, you had to be careful not to admire something in her house; she'd just pick it up and give it to you.

Interviewer: I just wanted to ask if there were any other treatments that you wanted to share with us.

Grishna: With the lemon, Shri Mataji used lemon for every chakra, really. You just put a vibrated lemon... if the chakra is catching or you feel discomfort, you just put a vibrated lemon on the particular chakra and you hold it for some time. You can feel the vibrations from the lemon coming in. Whatever is not wanted, it's like an exchange. The vibration is going in, and Shri Mataji said the lemon acts as an extra chakra because the negativity just goes into that lemon. It has to go somewhere. The lemon has to be disposed of. Normally I just throw it away, but when I first came, people used to cut them up or bury them.

Also, Shri Mataji would vibrate salt and sugar for us Herself at the time. You can put the salt and sugar in front of her picture, and then the vibrations come from the picture overnight. It's good to drink vibrated water if you have problems with your stomach. I wonder if people do this very often, especially with salt and sugar. It's very good because then you can add the vibrated salt and sugar to your food and you have the vibrations.

Interviewer: Thanks for those treatments and especially for reminding us about vibrated sugar and salt.

Grishna: Also, ghee should be vibrated. Using ghee is very important. The ghee could be vibrated in front of Shri Mataji's photo and then used for clearing the Hamsa chakra.

Interviewer: It has been fantastic talking to you both, Pat and Grishna. Thank you so much for your time. It's just amazing to remember Shri Mataji spending those times with you for so long, days on end.

Pat: It's great that you're giving so much time yourself to do all this. I'm not personally keen on interviews, but I think it's good to get some of this stuff recorded for the future.

Interviewer: Yes, essentially because it has always happened that after the incarnations, it takes probably centuries and then you think, "Oh, it's mythology," but it's actually not.

Grishna: Yes, thank you very much for being with us.

Interviewer: Thank you so much from all of us. Thank you.

Pat: And thank you for all you're doing. Thank you so much. Goodbye.
