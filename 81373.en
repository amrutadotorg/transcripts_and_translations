Your golden times with Shri Adi Shakti, Shri Mataji, Nirmala Devi. Now, this public program we played of 20th December 1989, beautiful shots of Maharashtra and beautiful shots to see those people and Shri Mataji there with all those lights and the beautiful vibrations. Please tell us, where were you? How were you when you met Shri Mataji? What was your first meeting with Shri Mataji like? I believe you were in that video at a very young stage of your life. Would you please share with us?

Definitely. Thank you very much, Sushmita Didi, for this opportunity. And thank you, Shri Mataji. Really golden memories to be preserved, and so much that we have got and received from Shri Mataji. And yes, this is 1989 when it was the first public program for me when I saw Shri Mataji for the first time. So basically, I saw her for the first time in 1989. We got our realization in June. In fact, in just a few days is my anniversary, 36th anniversary of my second birth.

Oh, very nice. Yeah, that is your second birth.

So we got our realization in June. And in December, that is when we saw Shri Mataji. The tour would start at that time. This is in Shrirampur evening. And they had a great procession before Shri Mataji when she arrived in Maharashtra. We used to have the processions in the village with all the drums. And we were all young. We were Shakti girls.

We were told by an aunty, because this is a different city. We got realization in Ahmadnagar and we went to Shrirampur for the public program of Shri Mataji. We were at the place of one of the aunties, Amle. Her name is Amle, and in the video, she is there as well. It was her relatives, so they said, "Kanchan, you come to us. We got everything for you. You have a sari, and you have to dress up. You are going to the program." I said, "Thank you very much," because I didn't know. With my parents, we just went from one city to the other city to see Shri Mataji. Very generous of them. They helped me, these sisters, and they helped me to wear a sari. As you could see, a few of us girls had a gajra.

Then we went. We were waiting on the stage. They said, "When Shri Mataji will come..." There was another uncle who was telling us, "When mother comes, you all have to welcome. Here is an aarti plate. Here are petals. Here is a lamp and some kumkum. When Shri Mataji comes, on her feet, you have to offer this. And you offer the aarti to her." Because this is not my city, I didn't have an aarti plate, so I was just listening to them. I was on the stage, and I said, "I hope I get one plate," because on the floor were many, many aarti plates. Everyone had brought one aarti plate. All the girls were there. I said, "Shri Mataji, I will wait. And when everybody is gone, let me see if anything remains." And each girl took one aarti plate and they all went. There was just one plate right in front of me. I looked around; there was nobody. So I said, "Thank you, Shri Mataji. This is for me." And then I took that aarti plate.

We were Shakti girls in two rows, waiting near the steps for when Shri Mataji would come that way, and then we would all do the welcome for her. I was quite close to the stage, and I remember very well, on the left-hand side of Shri Mataji. So when Mother comes, I'm on the left side. We had been waiting quite a while, could have been an hour or so, with our plates, waiting for Mother. We didn't know when she would come, but as I said, there was a procession, which we didn't know. It was a very good procession. So when Mother came, we could hear a lot of sound, and Shri Mataji came. We had this excitement, having been waiting to see her. And they said, "Shri Mataji, Shri Mataji came!"

And we were like this. I looked at her. Who came? And Shri Mataji came. When she came and I looked at her... actually, during a hot, sunny day, when we look up at the sun, it shines in our eyes. That was my first impression. When I looked at her, her face was like the sun. It shined in my eyes, and I couldn't actually look at her. So I closed my eyes. In my heart, I said, "Shri Mataji, how will I look at you? I can't even see you." I felt so bad. Then I said, "Let me try." I opened one eye; I could see her. Then I opened my other second eye. Oh, my God, I can see her! And I saw her beautiful white sari, her hair, a great personality. And she was coming towards the stage.

And we girls are here now. We have a task. I was looking towards the last girl there, who was close to Mother, and she missed it. Couldn't offer the petals. And I said, "Oh, my God, she missed it. How am I going to do this?" The girls were just watching. I said, "No, I have to do something. Before she comes close to me, I will sit down," because we were all standing. So when I saw Shri Mataji approaching, very peacefully, slowly she was coming. When Shri Mataji came a little closer, I sat down. And where I was sitting down, Mother came and she just stood there. She stood.

I could only see her feet. Shri Mataji's lotus feet I saw. I put petals on one foot. She was still there. Then I offered the remaining petals on both her lotus feet. There was some rice, kumkum, I offered on her feet. I said, "Namaskar." And when I finished, after that, Shri Mataji moved ahead. So basically, what you see in the video is when Mother came forward. And those days, maybe because of the shooting, they didn't shoot us. I remember seeing this video. I was there, but because of the darkness... But anyways, this was my first experience to see the goddess and have the opportunity to offer petals at her lotus feet.

And then Shri Mataji was on the stage. All these yogis, new people, foreigners at that time... We were teenagers. I was one of the attractions. They were singing the bhajans, and I said, "Wow." They're singing in Marathi and all this. The dress, their saris. It was very unique for us to see. I was in Ahmadnagar. So let's go back 35 years ago. It was kind of a village. Like Bombay, Delhi, they're advanced cities. But Ahmadnagar comparatively was much more rural. More village, more farms. Simple people. Yes.

It was great for me to see these things. It was a lot of enthusiasm. We sat right at the front, just listening to Shri Mataji, just watching her. Didn't quite understand what she was saying, but one sentence stayed with me until today. I have it in my mind. Shri Mataji was speaking in Marathi, and towards the end of the talk, she said, "Do you understand what your mother is saying to you?" And I remember she said, when she gave realization, she said, "Raise your hands." We all raised our hands. And she said, "Oh, these are the diamonds I see." She said, "These are the diamonds." Then she said, "Do you realize what your mother is saying to you?" And it stayed with me. I said in my heart, "Shri Mataji, what is it that you're telling us? What is it that we are not understanding?" So now over all these years, the essence, how important it is, the self-realization, and what has happened to us. I think this is what she was trying to say. But I'll never forget Shri Mataji and her face and that sentence. It's still in me.

It was really beautiful. And, now I'm in Toronto and we travel so many different countries. And when we go to India and those vibrations, now I understand what Shri Mataji says about it. As I mentioned before, Ahmadnagar—in fact, Ahmadnagar, Rahuri, Shrirampur, all these in the Ahmadnagar district—Shri Mataji said, "It is my Azor." Azor means my grandparents' place. So it's a very, very special place, and the vibration is really, really strong.

Your question was, we were very young. I very well remember the first day we went for realization in the place of our uncle and auntie. And they said, "Okay, some people have come from Shrirampur and they will tell us about Sahaja Yoga." I didn't quite understand what they were saying, but we sat. And okay, this is what it is. You will feel cool or warm in your hands. And regularly, they decided one day, you all will come for weekly meditation. And that's it. It just started. Since then, every week, we were always there going for meditation. We have the small black and white photograph of Shri Mataji. That was our altar. Very dedicated. And they said, "Okay, this is how you have to do foot soaks. Every day."

It was very interesting. We used to do foot soaks at home. Four of us: my mom, my dad, me, my brother. We had one tub. And when one person sits for foot soaks, it was like this: just focusing on Mother, no movement. We used to have mosquitoes sometimes in those days. So the other three would sit around that person. For example, if Yogesh is doing a foot soak, the three would be around. If any mosquito comes on him, we would shush that mosquito because he shouldn't move. He has to do the foot soak really focused, not looking here and there. So we three were there to help him. When I'm doing the foot soak, the other three would help me. That's how we grew up. It was fantastic.

We used to wait. Sometimes, in a few months, some yogis would come to our place. We would wait to hear the stories. At that time, there were different stories happening with Shri Mataji and they were getting passed on. And we would listen to it and just follow whatever Shri Mataji said. And when I saw her for the first time, you could see even in the video. In fact, in the beginning, there's my dad and Yogesh. The enthusiasm is like, the curiosity is like, "Wow."

Didi, I would like to mention Shri Mataji as a personality. Because as you said, rural area. So we are usually shy. Even the other ladies we see, they were usually shy. They will not come forward. They will not speak. They will be at the back. This is the kind of women I had seen. But this great personality—brave, strong, courageous, Shri Mataji—I think it's a very great message for us. The power which she was. And I really saw it and experienced it. It was just great. I don't know what else I can say to explain the beauty of Shri Mataji and her greatness and her love and compassion.

We used to have tape recorders. Do you remember, Didi, at that time in Ganpatipule, she used to give gifts? She used to give tape recorders to the centers as gifts. I remember very well. A new center started in this area, so she would give the tape recorder. "So you play my cassettes." We had so many tapes of Mother, but in Marathi and Hindi we had Shri Mataji's talks. And there was another thing which we call now, the name is Cool Breeze. The same thing was Chaitanya Lahari. Chaitanya Lahari was the book in Maharashtra.

So whichever puja took place of Mother, say, for example, I remember very well in Turkey, she had a puja. So within two months, that talk, someone would write it down, and it was getting translated into Marathi. And that translation, they would make into a book. So for two or three months of pujas, the live pujas, there was a translation in Marathi with one photo on the top. Every time, I used to collect those pictures of Mother. Every book, we would get one photo of Mother. So this way, they would print the books. And because we were in Ahmadnagar, we had to register in Pune. So from Pune, by post, it would come. I used to wait for that. The books, when it comes, the Chaitanya Lahari will come. I used to go to school and wait for it. I still remember the khaki color envelope. And in that big envelope would be this book. Two pujas, three pujas. And sometimes at the back, the tour of Mother. They used to write the program of Shri Mataji. She's coming here. So whatever information they had, they would write it in there.

It used to come, I still remember, I would come back from school, and my dad would say, "The book has arrived." I'd take the book, take the chair, water, go in the garden, close the door, sit in the chair, and read what Mother said. What Shri Mataji said. What is this puja? Memory, yes, yeah, absolutely.

It happened in Pratishthan. It should be year 94, I think. I don't remember exactly the year, but it was the public program which happened again in Pune. And then, the next day, my mom, my dad, myself, and one of my uncles, we had the desire. We want to go and visit Shri Mataji at Pratishthan. Because we came from Ahmadnagar, and we wanted to tell Mother about how the progress is happening with the Ahmadnagar collectivity. Because, as I said, it was much smaller, much younger as compared to Pune. So, they were doing well there.

We went to Pratishthan. We had the opportunity. Oh my God. She was upstairs. Before entering into that room, for a moment, I was like, "I'm going to see her." For a moment, I was like this. And I said, "I should go." When I entered, I very well remember, it's like another area. You entered another area. You feel it. It's an experience, to be honest. So, when we went, you can't just talk to her. You just saw her. And when I first saw her, she looked huge, huge. I said, "Oh my God. She's so big." And then I went down, did namaskar. I came up. She was like, I saw her now. This was my very close experience with her. And very well, I remember her teeth. Beautiful, shining teeth. I said, look at that. How we say, pearls. Really, it was my experience I saw.

Yesterday was a public program, and today, she was a bit tired. I think some other yoginis from Delhi were before us. They also saw Shri Mataji. They bought a few things. We bought a garland for Mother, some sweets for Shri Mataji. And then she asked, "Where you come from?" We said, "Shri Mataji, we come from Ahmadnagar." Then she said, "Oh, Ahmadnagar." She said, "Amcha Azor." That means, this is the place of my grandparents, she said. My grandparents come from that place. And then she said, "This is a very nice place. Machindranath, Gorakshanath, all these Naths had been there." I remember very well, she was telling us a lot about Maharashtra, the place of Ahmadnagar.

And then she said, "Oh, yesterday, we had a public program. Were you there?" And, yes, we were there in the public program. For a moment, she looked like, "Oh, yes, I remember. You were there." We were like, maybe, I don't know how many people, maybe 50,000 people. But for a moment, she was like, "Yes, I remember. You were there." Wow. Yeah. And then she said, "See, how many people were there? Oh, the whole city got its realization," she said. "The entire city got the realization yesterday."

Then we started to tell her that, "Mother, so many yogis have increased. We meditate regularly there. We have a center." She was very happy. She was very, very pleased. And we gave her one videotape to Shri Mataji. And we told her, "Mother, during Shri Ganesha festival, which we recently had, we had a stand. We took one place for Ganesha festival. And there, we had our decoration of Sahaja Yoga. We put a human figure made of wood, and for the chakras, we put lights. With electricity, it would light up like this." Yuvashakti, he was one of our Yuvashaktis. They didn't have a decoration, so we said, "Okay, you have your Ganpati Mandar. We will put our decoration." So then we had this decoration of flyers. We girls used to make Rangoli every day. And we had flyers. All the people who came, we were giving them the flyers. And we invited one video guy to make a video. So he made the video.

And actually, in that video, a miracle had come. In the beginning, this video guy showed the altar of Mother, the black and white photograph, and from here, the light had come. We were so new. We made only two video cassettes. One, we gave to Shri Mataji. "Shri Mataji, we have this." And one, very well I remember, I think I gave to Yogi Mahajan. But I don't remember where it is.

One interesting thing, we told Mother. We said, "Shri Mataji, we wanted to make our Mandar in one place first. But there was one guy, who has a flower shop. He opposed. He said, 'No, no, no. Why do you want to put your thing here? People will not see my shop.'" All this. He opposed. But it was okay. We got a better area. "But, Shri Mataji, we recently had the earthquake. And in the earthquake, nothing happened to anybody, to our houses. But this shopkeeper who opposed us, his balcony of flowers fell down."

"Which year is this?"

"Oh my God. Do you remember we had this huge earthquake in Latur?"

"Yes, yes. Wow."

"And that fell down. And then Shri Mataji just listened to us. And she said, 'Yes, Ganesha did it.' And she laughed. 'Ganesha did it.' Oh, wow. Yeah. But it was really great. Nothing happened to any yogis. Nothing. Perfect. But this guy, and it was a good house, his balcony fell down. He was so worried that if you put your stall, people will not see my shop."

*

I would like to share one more thing. As I said, I used to be a volunteer there very often. And it was Akshay Tritiya. It should be October, November time. And Shri Mataji was in Genoa. I am in Kabela, in the castle. We were so many volunteers at that time. And I knew today is Akshay Tritiya. And Indians, see our conditionings. How is it possible that it is an auspicious day and I am here? I should be with Mother. I should go to Genoa. It is in my head. I want to go to Genoa. But how will I go? With whom will I go? Whom should I ask? It is going on in my head.

It didn't happen. I asked this person. "No, we can't go." "No, I don't know." I was very sad. I came upstairs in the mezzanine floor. We had the meditation room. Now, it is the ladies' dormitory, but at that time, it was the meditation room. I sat and I was very sad. I looked at the altar. I said, "Shri Mataji, it's Akshay Tritiya, and I am not there." And believe me, Didi, from the photograph of Mother, Shri Mataji is saying, "Where are you going? I am here."

And I sat down. Oh my God. And I did meditation. Very strong Kundalini. I did my meditation. I said, "Sorry, Shri Mataji." And then I just went down. I said, "It doesn't matter. I will cook." I did not go to Genoa. But it was a very, very clear message to me. We shouldn't feel that Shri Mataji is not here. She is very much with us. So physically, Shri Mataji was in Genoa, but she gave me the message on the photo in the castle. "I am here." This was 2010.

*

Actually, I didn't have a home. I didn't have a place. So then I said, "Okay." I said, "But I am not alone. My parents are with me." He said, "That's fine. You come." The Navaratris had just finished, so all the volunteers had gone. There was a place in the castle. Then I came to the castle and I stayed there. I said, "We will see later on. Maybe my parents will go to India." But I stayed in the castle.

And the first thing, I remember so well. When I entered the castle, I said to both my parents—the big door, you know, the black door—I did offer namaskar to the apartment. Of course, it was closed. In my heart, I was talking to my parents. And I said, "We will stay here, but we will pay. This is Shri Mataji's house." I am talking to them. It came to me, as if Mother is saying, "What will you give to Shri Mataji?" And I said, "Yeah, that's true. We take from her. What am I going to give her?" This was my very first list. Immediately, the message from Shri Mataji. So I said, "Okay, Mother." Then we went. We stayed. I was continuously on my feet. I never just sat and relaxed. No. I would go in the kitchen, cook the food, help the aunties in cooking, do the dishes. If not, clean the kitchen. If not, clean the house. Continuously. I was working there.

And then it happened. I said, "I am not going back to India." Papa went to India for a while, but my mom stayed with me. And I told her, "I don't feel like going to India. I want to stay here." But I wasn't sure if I could stay in the castle. And they were happy with me. They said, "No, continue. Stay." And then later on, I was in the castle. Since 2015, from Navaratri, I stayed till 2019.

I would definitely like to mention here, Didi, Shri Mataji is there. She is so much. I have so many experiences beyond words there with Shri Mataji. I went to India during that period because December was a low season. There were no pujas. So I also went to Pune with my dad. And I visited Uncle Nalgirkar there because when he used to come to Kabela, I had the privilege and Mother's blessings that I was able to serve them. They are like my parents. I really have great respect for them. And so they also told me, "Kanchan, if you come to Pune, visit us." I said, "Sure, Uncle. I will come." We had a good conversation. And I was about to leave. At the door, at the entrance, Uncle said one thing to me which stayed with me. He said, "Kanchan, in those days, in the physical form of Shri Mataji, there were many Indian girls who were going through tough times, especially after Sahaj marriages. Shri Mataji used to call them to her house. And she used to take care of them. What was happening in Shri Mataji's home, that is now happening with you in her Nirakar form."

It just touched my heart. I went out of the house. I was on the bike with my dad. The whole night, I was continuously crying. I couldn't stop my tears. "Shri Mataji, you love me. You care for me. You are looking after me." It was a tough time, but she just looked after me. She cared for me.

And I must say, and I want to say this to all the women, not only the yoginis, but to the women of the world: The greatest, the Mother of the Universe is with us. Very powerful. Very courageous. Very brave. And a great support for her daughters. This is our Mother. Don't ever be afraid. Don't ever be shy. Stand on truth. Stand on your feet. Shri Mataji wants to see her daughters brave, standing on their feet, being themselves in their dignity. We are mothers. We are the daughters of Shri Mataji. And what a great power we have. And I'm telling you, Didi, every step she is looking after you. I felt like a flower. Like a flower she was holding me in her hands. Believe me, Didi. I was going through a lot of things. And at that time, I must tell you, I lost my mother in that period. In less than one year, I lost two people. It was a big blow to me. But I stood. And Shri Mataji kept me so busy in Kabela. I worked. Work, work, work. Sometimes, no sleep. But I was working. Shri Mataji never let me feel that I lost something. No. Vibrations are there. You have a big family. You have a great task to do. Yes. And the whole life is in front of you.

My message to everybody is, we all go through tough times. Yes. Difficult times. And we cannot say, "Oh, she has the difficulty, I don't." It's not possible. We all go through it. And it is for our growth. It is for our growth. It will make you strong. You will cross some border, some boundary, some conditioning. You will become a better human. But for me, I would say, we are yogis, we will ascend. It is one step ahead in our ascent. Some conditioning, some ego, some obstacle inside, we will cross. Shri Mataji helped me to cross it. I crossed it.

You know so well, we are Indians. We saw the video from 35 years ago. I am 51 years now. 50 years ago, how was this world? I come from Ahmadnagar. I come from Pune. No television, no telephone, as you said, no mobile phones, some letters, and just going to school, coming home. This was our life. The only people we knew were surrounding my auntie. The conditionings are so strong that you are a woman, you are a girl, this is your life, this is your path. Look down. Not too much makeup. This is how we grew up. And now this, oh my God, now what? My life is finished? No, it's not finished. You are the pure spirit. This is who and what you are.

And another thing, Didi, Shri Mataji has always supported her daughters. Always. She has married her daughters. She has helped them to get a divorce. Again, she has married them in Sahaja Yoga. And for women like me... in fact, there is one Marathi talk where she says, "In Sahaja Yoga, we do not believe in Vaidhavya, in widows." We don't believe in that. And she said, "You have to put the Bindi." Yes. What a strong condition. To break this condition is huge. And Shri Mataji did that. What a great idol we have in front of us. She's the real reformer, the social reformer she is. And at the same time, she has spoken to politicians. She's great in every aspect. And we just need to follow, to understand the essence of that, and bring it into us, to live that. I'm thankful to her. She developed that in me. She gave that courage.

In 1991 was my first puja. Ganpatipule was my first year. So that year, when we went to Ganpatipule, okay, puja, puja, we know this word "puja" in Hindi. We know, okay, it's a puja. Shri Mataji is on the stage. I'm sitting there. And she said, "Today, we will offer the puja to Lord Christ." The moment I heard "Lord Christ," for a moment, I was like, "Christ?"

As a new person, when you hear this... for us, since childhood, it's that they are different, you are different. They are Christians, you are Hindus. We are separate. But here, I'm doing the puja to Christ. These two things are so separate, different: Puja and Christ. And Shri Mataji is here. So for a moment, I was like this. But then I said, okay. Immediately, it went out. And then later on, she explained and she said, "Christ is the incarnation of Shri Ganesha." Oh my God. So a very big conditioning was broken at that time. Not that I was holding on to it, but it's so subtle. It's very deep in the back of our mind. These things are so subtle.

This gives us the power and the energy in Shri Mataji to develop our personality. Then we can open our hearts, our arms to everybody. There is no, "which color skin you have, what is the color of your hair, if you're short." It doesn't exist anymore. It's just the heart that we see and how much you are seeking. And as Mother was giving, so how much can I give you? How much love can I give you? This is what happened to me.

Since my teenage years, I have been practicing Sahaja Yoga. So I would say, Shri Mataji has helped in developing my personality, to break the conditionings. We learn from her how generous she was, giving gifts. When things were wrong, how strict she was, she was correcting us. And also, when we did something correct, she was praising us. How many things she taught. I remember she used to tell the foreigners who have come, "Exchange addresses. You should send letters, make friends with them." In Ganpatipule, she used to say, "You should make friends." So we have so many friends. At that time, we were friends in Delhi, friends in Chennai. And the next year, we used to wait. "Oh, we will meet again in Ganpatipule." So then this friendship, oh, this friend got married. She went to that country. So she really brought the world together.

If we look as a third person, with the eye of a non-yogi, we will see a huge revolution. Shri Mataji used this word, Kranti. Really, a Kranti it is. And we are a part of it. In the beginning, we were like, watching her and she was correcting us. And now, it feels like, you have to do it. You are at the front. We need to do it.

Thank you, Shri Mataji, again and again. Jai Shri Mataji.

Jai Shri Mataji. Thank you, Didi. Thank you very much. Thanks to everybody who listened. I tried my best. It is just my humble journey of my life, which Shri Mataji blessed me with. And everything that is beautiful, basically, is just praising her. My life story is not about me, but it's about her. How beautiful she is, a caring mother. And I want to say that it is her blessing that I had wonderful parents, just as you said, Didi. They have also played a very important role in my life, to shape me and to keep me on the path, that Shri Mataji is there, and you have to follow her. So, a beautiful life. In this wonderful, wonderful life, we are so blessed to have Shri Mataji with us all the time.
