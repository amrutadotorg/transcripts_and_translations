(At the end of the music program)
They told Me that they want to have a nice stick dancing now.

So those who want to have stick dancing can have it and those who want to sleep can sleep also (laughter, Shri Mataji laughs).
The musicians should be on one side to sing the song and let’s see how it works out with the stick dancing. And those who want to dance can take sticks from this side. And first it’s little difficult, but later on you pick it up, and it works very well.
And I think it’s a very dynamic dance and also brings out lots of rhythm within you, and I’m sure you’ll enjoy dancing. I wish I was young like you to dance.

May God bless you.

So the musicians can sit this side, those who have to sing the song.

Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.
