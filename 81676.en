Jai Shri Mataji.

Interviewer: Jai Shri Mataji. Hello, and thank you so much, Maria, for joining us all the way from Greece. It's a nice, pleasant evening for you there, and a late-ish afternoon here. It’s so sweet that you have joined us to share your golden memories with Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi herself.

Could you tell us about your seeking journey, please? It started very, very early on, didn't it?

Maria: Yes, yes, it was. Thank you for having me. It is a great pleasure to be with you.

This journey started at a very early age. I was about four years old when this question was in my mind continuously: If the Lord passed by me, how would I recognize him? And I could not find the answer. Would he be dressed like he was in the old days when he appeared on this earth? Will he be dressed in a modern gown or whatever? And I thought, "Oh my Lord, how would I recognize you if you passed by me?"

So the time passed. I became eleven years old. Since I was four, my father used to bring home some boxes with foreign letters, which was the British alphabet. And at my little age, I was thinking, "Oh, I must learn the language containing this alphabet." When I was eleven, I asked my parents to give me the opportunity to have some private lessons in this English language, the British language, which they did. And this is how I learned to speak English. Of course, when I was in the UK, I was more fluent. But now, all these years that I am back home, I can read fluently, but I cannot speak fluently. So you have to forgive me for any mistakes.

Interviewer: Not at all. I mean, this is for countries where English is not the first language, including in India. I remember my father started learning English in primary school at about eleven or twelve years old. So it's amazing how you asked your parents to let you learn the language just by recognizing some foreign alphabets. Now, at this point, there is an experience where you saw the Lord. Could you talk to us about it, please?

Maria: Yes. Well, I became seventeen years old. My family, we were not fanatic Christians, if you know what I mean. We were Orthodox Christians because this is the way everybody was here in Greece. But we were not fanatics, running to churches or forcing anyone to follow the priests and all that. Anyway, every time Easter was coming, I was really very upset. And I was saying, "Oh, my Lord, they crucify you again and again and again. I'm quite fed up with it. I cannot bear it."

The time came when I was so upset about it that something happened in the hall of my house. I got out of bed and said, "My Lord, I cannot bear all this happening. So please let me know." I walked into the hall of my house, and there I was in a vision. I walked into the ceiling, and there was the Lord up there, Lord Jesus, on the cross. I burst out in tears and said, "My Lord, don't do this to me because I just cannot bear it. You better kill me. I can't bear it."

And the nails came off his hands and feet, and he came down from the cross. He was dressed in a beautiful white gown, and he was smiling. He said, "Don't worry. This is all a Maya. I am alive. I am well. And nobody can touch me."

So I knelt down, and then I invited him to sit at the dinner table. And I said to him, "What do you want me to bring you?" And he said, "Just a glass of water will be enough for me." So I did. And I said, "Oh, my Lord, we are sitting on such a big, large table, just the two of us. This table will be soon filled with more people."

Anyway, we had this conversation. And when he was to leave, he said, "Is there anything you would like to ask me?" Oh, I forgot to tell you that as I was upset seeing the wounds in his hands, he opened his hands and said to me, "Put your hands on mine like that." And when I did, he said, "What do you feel?" So I felt pain in the middle of my palm. And I said, "My Lord, I feel so much pain there." And he said, "Don't worry. This is nothing. It will soon go. But you just remember me when the time comes." He said, "Remember me at the time of my death." His death was at 33 years old. And this has a meaning afterwards, because this is what age I was when I got my realization. I must have been 33.

Interviewer: Before we get there, Lord Jesus asked you to put your hands on his and to feel where there were nails. Was it an occasion that was very joyful inside, or was it about the pain that you thought the Lord felt? Can you tell us more about it, please?

Maria: Well, I put my hands on his, and I felt so much pain at the Sahasrara over here. And he said, "Don't worry because this will go. Not to worry about it." And the other thing is that before he left, he said, "Is there anything else you want from me?"

I was a student at high school at the time, and I said, "Of all the exercises of problems in geometry in this book, there is one that I cannot solve. Can you please help me?" And he started laughing. When I remember Shri Mataji, the way she was amused with us and laughing with us, it was exactly the same laughter and the same joy coming out of thinking, "Oh, silly question." And he said, "All right, I will give you the solution, but you remember it on the day of your exams." Of course, he gave me the solution to that problem, and on the day of my exams, that same problem came on the test. And of course, I knew the answer. And inwardly, I thanked him for giving me the solution.

Interviewer: Such innocence, isn't it? It is the Lord asking, "Is there anything I can help you with?" and you want a solution to a geometry problem. And the miracle is it comes in your exam and you can answer it.

Maria: Yes. But he was so amused because, to my account, that was a very, very serious problem for me at the time. And he was so amused that such a silly thing could be such a serious problem for me. He was really laughing in the same way I remember Mother was amused with us sometimes.

Interviewer: It's really nice that you share this because to all the viewers who watch now and in the future who are in school or colleges and have exams, it's a nice, inspirational story to know. You are an architect by profession, isn't it? So after high school, you studied architecture. When was it that you moved to England? Because your meeting with Shri Mataji happened in England, didn't it?

Maria: That's right, yes. What happened was that I was working and I was able to pay for my studies, because those days we had to pay for our studies. My father was a poor man and he could not afford it. He said to me, "Maria, I cannot afford for you to carry on." So I said, "Don't worry, Dad, I will work and take care of it," which I did.

At my work, I met Harry, who came from England to present new machinery at the place where I was working. He was the manager of that thing, and I was the only one who could speak English, so they asked me to accompany him and explain various things. This is how we met, and he decided that I was good enough to be his wife.

He asked me if I wanted to marry him, and I said, "Well, why not?" When I brought him to my parents, they said to me, "Who is this Englishman? They are all drunkards. What do you want with him?" Of course, they wanted some information from where he was to see what sort of man he was. The information they got was really fine, that he was one of the best gentlemen they could ever have in the company.

My marriage took place on the 21st of March, 1970, at 12 o'clock noon in East Ham, London.

Interviewer: Amazing!

Maria: And a funny thing happened on that day. They asked me to go to the hairdresser's and have a hairdo, which I did. When I came out, I felt that the whole of London was sitting on my head. So I went back home, went under the tap, and washed my hair and just combed it. I thought, "Well, I don't know what will come out of it." And the hairstyle that came out of it was amazing because I did not try to do anything about it. It just happened that it was such a beautiful look that when I looked in the mirror, I thought, "Oh my God, how did that happen?" And of course, an hour later was my wedding.

Interviewer: This is definitely a first, where the bride washes her professionally done hair an hour before a wedding and then comes out with a lovely hairdo. It would have been nice if you shared a photo of that time!

Maria: I can send it to you if you want me to.

Interviewer: That would be nice. So, from 1970, how did it work out? When did you get your self-realization?

Maria: Well, it started gradually. As time was passing, we moved from London to Wellingborough because the business had moved there. We got another house, and the seeking started growing from there onwards. To begin with, I thought, "Oh, they have the spiritualists." So I went there to see what happens. And I was quite confused, to tell you the truth, because they were talking about spirits possessing you and all that. I was saying to them, "Well, what is going to be with your spirit? How is your spirit going to grow if somebody else is possessing you?" And they had no answer. So I thought, "This is not for me." I can't have a strange spirit inside me, directing me. I have my own mind, my own growth.

Then, as the seeking was growing and growing, I started becoming very depressed because I could see signs in my house, like lights. I was thinking, "Oh, this is the Christ light," because I did not know anything about Shri Mataji or Sahaja Yoga. I thought something wants to tell me something, but I did not know what. So the depression grew more and more. Finally, I came to the point to say, "My Lord, if I do not find you, then there is no meaning for me being alive. I better go. I better die."

It was on the verge of me being so depressed that I really wanted to kill myself because I felt that there was not any meaning in my life if I didn't meet the Lord. I was at work, on my lunch break. I got into my car in Wellingborough, went into the town center, and got into a magazine shop. I just picked a magazine at random and I opened it. And there she was, Shri Mataji. Underneath her photograph, it said it was on a Monday, at seven o'clock at Caxton Hall.

I phoned my husband and said, "Well, I found her." Because he was telling me, "Let's go to Greece to find your mother. You're looking for a mother. Who is this mother? Your mother is in Greece." And I said, "No, this is not my mother. This is not the mother I'm looking for." I could not explain to him what sort of mother I was looking for. So anyway, at that point, when I opened that magazine and I saw her, I said, "Oh, I found her."

I phoned home and said to Harry, "I have to travel to London, so don't expect me too early because there is a meeting and I have to go and meet her." I drove onto the M1 and at the exit to London, I just did not know where I was going, where Caxton Hall was, or any streets of London. I was at the driving wheel, the car was going, and it stopped outside Caxton Hall. Don't ask me how I got there because I don't know. And I don't know how I got back on the M1 to get home.

Caxton Hall was absolutely packed, even people standing outside the door. Somebody came to me and said, "There is a seat for you." A Sahaja Yogi of the early days, I don't remember who he was, took me inside the hall where Shri Mataji was sitting. It was three rows in front of her, but three rows behind. There was a single seat there where they asked me to go and sit.

At the end of her talk, Mother, those days, used to get up and give realization to every single person. I was longing, "Oh my Lord, when will my turn come?" She eventually came to the person next to me, before me, giving realization. And when she finished, she just passed me without even looking at me and went to the next person on the other side.

At that moment, I was looking at her and I said, "My Lord, even touching your gown is enough for me." It is an overwhelming moment, which I will never forget. I will always feel so strongly about it... so please forgive my feeling at this moment.

At that point, she left that person next to me and she came back to me. When she did that, I put my hands around her waist and leaned my head on her Nabhi and I started crying, saying, "My Lord, at long last, I found you." And I was crying so much. Then I said, "Please, Mother, can I become your daughter?" And she said to me, "But child, you are already my daughter."

Then she asked for a glass of water. Remember the glass of water? She took the glass of water, she blessed it with her divine hands, and poured some of it on my head, like giving me a baptism. Then she asked me to drink from that glass. And that was my first encounter of how I got my realization from Shri Mataji.

Interviewer: Wow. This is in 1978. The Caxton Hall, in March. Amazing. To be told by Shri Mataji that you are her daughter when you asked. So sweet. There is something about your age at this time and the Lord's age when you got your realization.

Maria: I must have been 33. It's the same age that Lord Jesus Christ was when he was... because he said to me at that time, "Remember me when you come to my age," something like that.

Interviewer: So there you are, at 33 years you get your realization, your second birth, by Shri Adi Shakti, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi herself.

Maria: Yes.

Interviewer: Share with us, because it's very nice how your parents also attended a meeting. Was this before Shri Mataji visited you in Wellingborough?

Maria: No, after. What happened next was that on that same week that I got my realization, I phoned because I got information about the Chelsham Road ashram and I had the telephone number. I was so excited about meeting her. Gregoire answered the phone. I asked him, "Who are you?" He said, "Gregoire." I said, "All right, Gregoire, tell me if I can invite Shri Mataji up here where I live." I told him where I lived, up in Northamptonshire, because it is so important that the Lord has come on this earth and people must know about it.

But what I forgot to say is that I asked him, "Do you know who she is?" I asked Gregoire, "Do you know who she is?" And he said, "Of course, she is Adi Shakti." And I said to him, "What does Adi Shakti mean?" And he said, "The Holy Spirit." So I said, "Thank you for telling me such truth, because if you told me she was anything less than that, I would have ignored you completely." This was the first conversation I had with Gregoire.

Then the invitation came. I wanted him to ask Mother if she would like to come and visit us up in Northamptonshire and see how we can spread this wonderful news. He phoned me almost on the same day and he said, "Shri Mataji accepted and we can come on Saturday. But we will not stay. We will have to come just for a short visit and leave on the same day."

So on that first meeting with Shri Mataji in Northamptonshire at my home, it was a very short meeting. Nothing was arranged at all, other than preparing a meal for Gregoire, Gavin, and another yogi that accompanied Mother when they came that Saturday. I did not know what to do about arranging for people to come, but miraculously, somehow, people from the neighborhood were coming into the house after lunch. We had the Greek lunch, and Mother asked for the recipe, funnily enough. After that, people were coming into the house, getting realization, and I had not arranged anything at all. They left that same afternoon.

Of course, there were another two meetings that occurred. One was the Shri Ganesha Puja.

Interviewer: But before we get there, can we please request you to show us the photograph that you got when you first went to Caxton Hall?

Maria: Oh yes. A few days after, before Shri Mataji came to Northamptonshire, I had seen a few photographs, and there was a particular one that I did not want at all. So when I asked Gavin, who was arranging photographs at that time, inwardly I was praying, "Oh, that particular photograph I don't want to have." And of course, when I went to that meeting in London, Gavin called me after the meeting and he said, "Oh, I got your photograph, Maria." He was going to give me the one that I did not want to have. And he did. And there it is.

Interviewer: Wow. It's a very powerful photograph.

Maria: This beautiful photograph that, at that time, I could not bear even looking at it. Can you imagine? And I said to him, "Is this the photograph you're giving me? This is the one that I did not want." He burst out in laughter and said, "Well, this means that you needed to have this photograph, so you keep it." Some negativity did not want this photograph, and of course, this is why he gave it to me. I meditated on that, and whatever it was disappeared.

Interviewer: And this is when Shri Mataji visited you in Wellingborough in 1979?

Maria: In Irchester. I had moved from Wellingborough to Irchester at the time, which is a very small village near Wellingborough. So the second time we had Shri Ganesha Puja there.

Interviewer: Going back to the first time she came, just for the day. How did you prepare yourself? Here is Shri Mataji, the Holy Spirit herself, coming. What did you do?

Maria: I did not know what to do. All I thought was to prepare a good meal for her and the people who were going to come. So I prepared a Greek chicken soup, and then chicken in the oven with potatoes, and then a trifle for dessert. What I wanted to mention that is very important is that when we were sitting at that table—Shri Mataji opposite me, Gregor, Gavin, and this other yogi—I looked at her and inside me I said to myself, "Yes, my Lord, the table started filling with people." And she looked at me and she nodded like this. Without saying anything. She heard my thoughts and she nodded to me to say, "Yes, this is it."

Interviewer: Incredible. The table started filling with people. It's not just the two of you anymore.

Maria: Yes, because at that time I said to the Lord that such a big table and it's only the two of us, and he said to me, "Don't worry, because it will soon be filled with more people." That thought came to my head when we sat for that dinner, and I looked at her thinking that, and she smiled and nodded at me, like, "Yes, this is it. It started filling up with people."

Interviewer: So Shri Mataji visited you in July of 1979 for the first time, and you prepared a lovely Greek meal for her. Tell us any more memories that come to you from that first visit.

Maria: I don't remember much more. All I remember was that feeling at the dinner table was very strong. She asked me for the recipe for that meal, and I said, "Mother, it is a Greek meal and this is how we prepare it. I did not know what else to offer you because I'm not very familiar with British meals." She laughed and said, "Oh, this is fine, this is very tasty. You give me the recipe. How did you do the soup? How did you do the chicken with the potatoes?" I said, "The only British thing is the sweet, the trifle, and probably you know this recipe so I don't have to give it to you."

The other thing is that I had not arranged anything at all, and how all these people came from the neighborhood into the house to meet her is amazing because I did not know what was happening. All I wanted was for Mother to come and let us know how we are going to get on from here because I don't know what to do. I did not know any of the Indian customs or the British customs and how to arrange these things. I was just by myself without any other yogi there.

Eventually, I decided to arrange for meetings in Northampton and Bedford. I arranged for the Guildhall in Northampton and the Guildhall in Bedford, advertising it in the local newspapers. Shri Mataji also came to one of those meetings in Northampton. On that particular evening, there was a terrible fog coming down. I had to travel from Bedford where I was working, to my house in Irchester, and from my house to pick up all the things I had for the meeting in Northampton. The fog was going down to the ground. I don't know how I managed to get from work to home. I got into my house, got Mother's photograph, and I said, "Mother, what am I going to do? There is a fog down to the ground. How am I going to travel from here to Northampton?"

I opened the room for the meeting and I just opened my hands and I felt her telling me, "You just go." So I said, "All right." I picked up my things, got in the car. You could not see the road at all. As I started driving, leaving my house and coming into the main road, there was a tunnel opened in front of me, clear. The fog was all around that tunnel, and through that tunnel, I drove to Northampton. When I got outside the Guildhall, there were about 30 people waiting for the meeting.

Interviewer: Wow.

Maria: This is a miracle, of course, because after the meeting, I drove back through the same tunnel back to my house, and I had no problem at all.

Another miracle at one of the Bedford meetings was that it was pouring down with rain. I had to drive there, and as I was driving, I had to come to the side of the road because big lorries were coming against me and all the mud filled the car, and I could not see anything. Something was wrong with the windscreen wipers and they were not working. So I thought, "What am I supposed to do now?" I was sitting at the side of the road, put my hands out, and said, "Mother, you are my guide. You take over and you do what's supposed to be done."

So I got back, started the car again, and I pressed the button for the windscreen wipers, and they started working, pouring with water and clearing all the mud from the screen. I drove to Bedford, had the meeting, and came back. On the next day, I went to the garage to sort out the problem. The mechanic said to me, "I don't know what you're talking about, but your windscreen wipers are completely out. There is no water at all in the tank, and I don't know how you drove without them working and without having any water in your tank."

Interviewer: What a miracle, what a blessing from Shri Mataji. Wow.

Maria: At that time, I was on my own there. There were no other Sahaja Yogis, and I was praying for somebody to come and help me. People from London could not travel every week to help me out. But eventually, just before the Northampton meeting, John Glover moved to Northampton as a teacher, and of course, he was helping me from then onwards with Tracy to carry on with our meetings and help with Leicester, Cambridge, and Birmingham.

Interviewer: Please tell us how your parents had the lifetime opportunity of meeting Shri Mataji.

Maria: Yes, of course, it is amazing. I had not realized that my father was a seeker all his life, and I only realized it after meeting Shri Mataji. I was in England at that time and I kept in touch with my parents over the telephone. I spoke to my father about meeting Shri Mataji, and the moment I told him, he said, "I must come and meet her."

So they came to England, to Irchester, with my mother who was a bit reluctant. There was a meeting in London; I don't remember where it was. On the way down to London, my mother was pestering me with doubts about who this lady was that we were going to meet, and I got a little bit annoyed with her. We got down to London, into the third row, funnily enough, right opposite Shri Mataji. After her talk, people used to go to her feet, and my father did not ask anything, who she is or anything at all. He just went at her feet, bowing and getting her blessings.

But during the meeting, my mother started crying sitting next to me. She knocked on my arm and I said to her, "Be quiet." And she said to me, "Maria, can you see what I see?" I said, "Well, what do you see?" She said, "Where Shri Mataji is sitting, she's surrounded by angels." And I said to her very sharply, "Shut up, woman. This is for you to see and know who she is, because I know who she is." I pulled my ears because this was not the proper way to talk to my mother, but she did shut up.

Interviewer: Mother showed her who she was. Absolutely. It isn't in everybody's fortune to actually see who Shri Mataji really is.

Maria: Oh yes, yes. It's such a big blessing.

Interviewer: You were taking programs in the Guildhall in Bedford. Tell us about the miracle that happened there, because you were with Shri Mataji when it happened.

Maria: Oh yes. At that time, we had organized a very good meeting at the Guildhall in Bedford where the mayor came as well with his wife. The hall was absolutely packed. And at that time when Mother was speaking, something happened in the streets of Bedford, which we heard about the following day. A young boy was run over by a car, and from what he said to the people that went to help him, he said that an Indian woman dressed in a white sari came and she put her hand on the back of his spine where our Mooladhara is. She asked him to get up, and that he was going to be all right. And of course, he was fine. When we heard about it, the newspapers wrote about it, and we went to find out who that boy was.

After the Bedford meeting, the mayoress did not want to know anything about Sahaja Yoga or Shri Mataji. Shri Mataji was just an Indian lady who came to perform in her vicinity, and I was very upset about this behavior. On the way back home after the meeting, I was so upset that I was praying to Mother, and then I felt as if she asked me, "Maria, write a prayer for me." So I went back home and wrote this prayer, which I named "Spirit Divine." It goes like this:

Oh Mother of Heaven, Oh Spirit Divine,
I need to be closer, each day and each night.
Sweet ethers whisper, you speak in my heart.
You carry me higher with one mere glance.
Please, let me surrender. Please help me become
One with your ocean, one with your heart.

Jai Shri Mataji.

Interviewer: So profound. So beautiful. Thanks for sharing your prayer to Shri Mataji with us.

Maria: It was something else that I wanted to share with you, which is important. On that day that Mother was staying at my house for a seminar, we were in the bedroom, her and myself only. I was sitting down on the floor, and she was sitting on the side of the bed. I looked at her, and she said to me, in this divine form of hers, "Have no doubt, because I am the one you've been looking for."

Please forgive me, because to this very day, I feel very strongly when I remember these beautiful moments with Mother. I can only tell Sahaja Yogis, because not anyone else can understand the feeling. It is only you people that can understand what it is to be with the Lord. To touch her, for her to touch you, in whatever form she is. She came as a mother, and I feel so overwhelmed.

Interviewer: Please don't say that, because it's important that you share that with us. With our limited human brain, we tend to identify ourselves with labels and boundaries, but Shri Mataji told you that God is one.

Maria: "I am the one. Have no doubt," she said. It was just the two of us. I could not share it with anybody else.

Another thing was that before the Shri Ganesha Puja, before Mother came, I wanted to decorate the house in a beautiful way. It was the last moment, and I had not prepared all the decorations I wanted. What I wanted to do was to embroider some material that I had bought to make a curtain in the bathroom, and another little curtain to cover a cupboard. I thought, "Will I have enough time to do this embroidering in just a few hours?"

What I wanted to embroider was a young elephant on this curtain. I did not know how to do it. So I got the material on the table, I got a pencil, and I half-closed my eyes. I said, "All right, my Lord, you do it for me." And I started drawing a perfect young elephant on this material. I don't know how quickly this embroidering was going, but it was going so fast that it finished in no time at all. It was hung in the bathroom where Shri Mataji was supposed to use it.

Small miracles happen to us. Like on a silly thing, I tried to clean a light bulb on the top of the roof with a wet cloth. Can you imagine? The bulb burst, and all the glass went all around me without touching me at all. You see, these are small miracles that happen in our life that we have to believe that she is the one. There is no doubt about it. The Lord has come again on this earth, and we have to understand it. We must know it. We might not have another opportunity.

Interviewer: Let's talk about the Shri Ganesha Puja at your place. Was this where the miracle happened where you were cooking food?

Maria: Oh yes. The next day came, and I hung all the curtains. Another lady that Mother asked me to have at my house said, "I want so very much to do all the cooking." So three days before, she started cooking to have everything ready for that day. But on that morning, after the embroidering, I realized that all this cooking had turned bad. I had to throw the whole thing away. I had to go out again and buy more food and try to cook again.

When Mother arrived, I was not there. It is to my great sadness that I was not there to receive her because I was out trying to buy more food. Some other Sahaja Yoginis came to help me with that cooking. My concern was that the casserole was not full enough to feed everybody in that house. I was expecting about 60 people. And I was so worried when I started serving that meal, how would I manage to feed everybody?

But that casserole was not getting emptier. I was serving and serving and serving, and the food was still there without getting any less. So everybody was fed, and some of them wanted a second round, which they had. Somebody passing by the house came in and said, "Oh, I could smell some nice food, and I came to have something to eat." I asked Shri Mataji if we should allow him, and Mother said, "Of course, of course, let him come." So we gave him food. He went to her feet, got his realization. I don't know what happened to him after that. But when everybody was satisfied, then the casserole was empty.

Interviewer: It's so nice. This reminds one of that tale in Mahabharata when Draupadi prays to Shri Krishna and he gives her the Akshaya Patra, where the food doesn't finish. What did you cook in it?

Maria: Well, I asked her for a recipe. She asked me to do some chicken and she gave me some sort of a sauce that it should be marinated in and then be cooked. It was with rice. That was the main dish.

Interviewer: It's a wonderful story.

Maria: I must confess something. My marriage with Harry did not continue. It was broken because of some family problems on his side. When I asked Mother, "What was the meaning of this marriage? I cannot understand it." She said, "It happened because you had to meet me." Which means that our life and every step of our life is already organized, as long as we allow it to happen. If we allow our heart to lead us, we go on the right path.

Something else that happened was that being a Christian, I did not know anything about deities. We were in London, and I prayed, "Mother, I don't know who is Shri Brahmadeva, Shri Saraswati in connection to you, and who are all the other deities." When I went into meditation, she showed me every chakra. All these deities were just Mother. It was her image there. I told her that. I said, "Mother, I am so sorry, I did not know about all these deities, and I asked to find out. And when I went into meditation, you were in all my chakras." And she said, "Yes, of course, this is it. But don't do it again because it is dangerous."

Interviewer: There was this Navratri Puja in London, wasn't it? And there was a time when it was just you and her and she looked at your palm.

Maria: Oh yes. It was the 21st of October, and my birthday is on the 24th. After the puja, all the girls were sitting around her, having fun with Mother. She was pulling our legs, most of us. When she came to me, she said, "Oh, your birthday must be now." So I said, "Mother, it is in three days. It is on the 24th." "Oh," she said, "Oh, great, oh great." And laughing, she said, "Let me see your hand." So I gave her my hand, and she said, "Oh, you have a long life," all in a joking way. I said, "Mother, how long will that be?" Laughingly and jokingly, she said, "Eighty-three. Would that be enough?"

At that time, I was very young, and I said, "Oh, Mother, this is a long time. Absolutely fantastic." But now, as I'm talking to you, on October the 24th, I will become 80. So, another three years.

Interviewer: Wow. So you are taking advantage of that as much as you can.

Maria: Laughing, because after that, I don't know where I am going to be, according to Mother.

Interviewer: Any more memories from those times?

Maria: The funny part of my experience is when they renovated the house in Brompton Square. I came down from Northamptonshire just for a visit to see what was happening. It was a place of mad people working there. I was thinking, "Oh my God, what are they doing? What is going to come out of what they are doing?" Everybody was so confused, so disorganized. At that time, I was so concerned. I thought, "They are not building this house, they are going to demolish it." But of course, there was Shri Mataji directing everything. Today, when I look back at those days, I'm laughing because it was so hilarious to see everybody trying to do their best.

Interviewer: And also, in those days, you were probably at the peak of your career as an architect, so to see that happening must have made it all the more funny.

Maria: It was funny the way everybody was trying their best with all their heart to do a perfect job, but nothing was coming out right. Everything was so confusing. But finally, the place was done so beautifully, because Mother is the architect. She's the divine architect.

I remember also the first days when people were getting their realization, they would go out in the street like zombies with hands open, walking in their socks, no shoes on. I was thinking to myself, "Oh my God, if people see them, they will think they're mad." Like zombies walking with closed eyes on the pavement, no shoes, with holes in their socks and with hands open like that, murmuring something. And of course, Mother put all that right. She said we should walk in dignity and be nicely clean and nicely dressed. She gradually brought everybody back to normal.

Interviewer: Thank you so much for sharing those stories.

Maria: It is a great pleasure. And I thank you for allowing me to do this. Thank you, Shri Mataji, for giving me that experience and all of us this opportunity to hear her glory and the miracles and the blessed life she has given us. More beautiful people are coming in. But those days, we needed to be transformed because we were so scattered-brained. We needed all that time with her to become part of today's Sahaja Yoga.

The new people that are coming in now, they are far greater than us, the older ones. You must believe me, because they have not seen Mother. They have not lived with Mother. And they come with an open heart and they believe in her, while we had to see her, to be near her, and try gradually to come up. So all younger people who come into Sahaja Yoga are far, far greater than all of us.

Interviewer: Well, all of you who had that physical proximity to Shri Mataji, basically what Shri Mataji calls you is the foundation. So thank you for being there and thank you for this interview.

Maria: Thank you so much for joining us. God bless you all.

Interviewer: Thank you for having me. Jai Shri Mataji.

Maria: Jai Shri Mataji. God bless you. Thank you.
