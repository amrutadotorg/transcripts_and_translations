 (England)
Welcome to Sahaj Golden Writers. I'm Rohan, and today with me is my co-host, sister Felicity, joined from the UK, and brother Rishi from the US. Today we're going to be interviewing, or having a talk show with, one of the great Sahaj writers, brother Chris, and he's joined by his wife, sister Ruth. Welcome, everyone.

Welcome. Good to have you here, brother, and all of you there.

Yes, I'm so excited. This is our first conversation with Sahaj authors, and Chris and Ruth have kindly joined us today to talk about Chris's first two books, Sahaja and Sophia. Do you want to just show the photos so we can see? Sahaja: An Introduction to Sahaja Yoga and Sophia. Beautiful book.

Chris is going to talk about his books, the writing of them, and particularly share with us inspirations and Shri Mataji's influence and encouragement in writing both these books. And we'll hear how it took 14 years to write the first.

And could we just say a little bit... so Chris and Ruth have been practicing Sahaja Yoga for nearly 44 or 45 years, since they were as young as Rohan and Rishi. And Rishi was born realized, born into Sahaja Yoga, and is a poet, musician, author, and writer himself. And Rohan, our lovely technical guy, was born in India, living now here in the UK, and studying finance. Anyway, a little bit of background about all of us, and this is the first in our series of the Golden Writers. So welcome, Chris. Would you like to start? Tell us about yourself a little bit.

It's difficult to know what to say, and one doesn't usually get asked about one's life, but I'll try not to open the floodgates.

Yeah, just a little bit because we want to talk about the book.

So, I was born in 1952 in Worthing on the south coast of England, where my mother's parents were living at the time. My father was a soldier, and he met my mother when he was abroad in Trieste, and they got married. I was born. They moved to Africa, to Kenya, where he was involved in one of the colonial wars over there, putting down a rebellion. And my mother died very quickly. This was when I was one, nearly two, I think.

We came back to England. My father felt—I was his first child—he didn't quite know what to do with me. So he was going to have me adopted, apparently. I didn't learn this till many, many years later. But his mother, my grandmother, stepped in. She was in her 60s by then, but she was a very determined, very noble lady, and she decided she would be my guardian. So I was looked after mainly by her. My father was abroad usually; he lived in the Far East a lot. And also by my other grandmother. I spent quite a lot of time with her. She lived in Sussex with her husband, my grandfather, who was an art dealer. So art played a part; that was sort of in the background of my early life. He had a lot of beautiful pictures at his home in Sussex.

I was sent to boarding school, Epsom College. It's not one of the famous schools, but it was academically very good. And then I went to Durham University to study English. I wasn't sure what to do. Someone suggested—he was going to study the following year in Birmingham at a place, a postgraduate department that had recently been set up to study cultural studies. I was interested in that, so I went there. I got a place, luckily.

And then after that, I did various things. Mainly I was writing. I became a teacher and a lecturer, but mainly always writing, trying to just develop a style. But I was only really interested in writing certain things. It wasn't that it was the subjects that were important, rather than just to be a professional writer and write one book after another. So yeah, that's a brief introduction.

That's great. And so then how long after that... eventually you got your... you were seeking. When I read the book Sahaja, you were definitely seeking a spiritual truth. And you got your realization. When was that?

I was always interested in something beyond, what one could call the fundamental questions: What are we here for? What is the meaning of my life? I felt very strongly that I had a sort of job to do in this world, that there was some meaning, some purpose to my being here for myself. I don't mean for the universe, but in a personal way, I felt I do have some sort of purpose. What is it?

And then by great good fortune, and in a rather crucial way, I met Shri Mataji at Caxton Hall, where a lot of programs were being given in those days in London, just after my birthday. So it was in June 1978. And I felt at once, this is it. This is what I have to do, I want to do. So I never looked back.

Being interested in writing and always writing, I wanted to write about Sahaja Yoga to try to introduce it to others and to clarify for myself what it means and all the arguments. How do you introduce it to people? How do you deal with the big questions of, is there a God? These kind of things. So I felt it would certainly help me to write it in a comprehensive but fairly brief introduction. And yes, it did take me a long time, but I wrote various different versions.

And quite early on, when Shri Mataji came to Bristol the first time, I mentioned that I was trying to write, or somehow the subject came up that I was trying to write about Sahaja Yoga. She was very encouraging and told me I should talk about how I came and go on from there. So she didn't lay down a definite plan or anything. She left it up to me. But she did say I should write about how I came to Sahaja Yoga. But I wanted to do that in a brief way. I didn't really want the book to be autobiographical, exactly, because that would put the emphasis too much on my individual experience when what I wanted it to do was to be a book for everybody. Or at least everybody who is seeking something. So I did talk about myself, but a very little bit. And I tried to make every point into something that had a general meaning for more people than just one individual.

And it took me a very long time to feel satisfied with it. The first version... it was sort of becoming agony after a while because I felt I should be finishing this. And instead, I was really getting bogged down. I was quoting a lot of other writers and philosophers and so on, referring to philosophies and religions, and trying to kind of situate Sahaja Yoga within the grand tradition of religion and spirituality and philosophy. But I was not writing as spontaneously as I wished to. Of course, there's always the difficulty of: you have to be spontaneous for it to be in any way inspired. But it also, at least for me, has to be very polished. So getting those two sides of art together is itself quite a work.

So that what comes out is, if possible, inspired and feels right. And that, yes, it should be like this. But at the same time, it should also be perfected as much as possible. It should be expressed, I feel for myself, poetically and logically. And again, those are two rather opposite things. So on the one hand, a rationally coherent, logically meaningful way of writing, intellectually satisfying and according to scholarly—let's say scholarly rather than academic—principles. But on the other hand, it should be poetic and lyrical, beautiful, if possible, melodious. So again, that's quite a work to integrate those two sides. But I've always tried to do that.

Do you think because it was your first book, that's why it took longer? Because you were trying to bring all these...

It wasn't my first book. I wrote a novel when I was at university, which I've never looked at since, when I should have been studying. But then I wrote several books, mostly novels for younger adults, but they weren't particularly successful according to my standards. They weren't published.

But yeah, go back to Sahaja. Because I took it so seriously, I think that was one of the reasons why it took so long, because it seemed to me this is the grandest of subjects, and it has to be done seriously. So anyway, I wrote this turgid book with all these quotations and so on. And then one day, I just ditched all that. I thought, no, let's try and leave all the quotes and just write it from my own perspective. But I really had to go through quite a lot of experiences myself before I could get to that stage where you just feel... it sounds odd to say, but a kind of devil-may-care mood where you just feel the confidence to express yourself without, hopefully, being self-indulgent.

Yes. I wondered if this was a good point... so Ruth was telling us that maybe, Ruth, you could bring in, because you remember you said every time you would meet Shri Mataji, she would make some reference...

Yes, of course. I think one of the reasons it took so long to write was because it was an incredibly difficult task he'd given himself. He was trying to reach every kind of seeker, or as many types of seeker as possible. And he was also trying to do it in a way that it wouldn't confront the ego of the person reading, so it wouldn't put them off in any way. I think that's a very subtle thing to do. And Shri Mataji did say initially to Chris that she wanted him to write a substantial book on Sahaja Yoga that would start with his own seeking.

Over those 14 years, when we saw Shri Mataji at airports and so on, when she was coming and going, she would always ask Chris, "How's the book coming on?" A typical Chris answer, like, "So-so, Shri Mataji," or something like that.

And then in the end, shortly before he actually wrote it, she asked him this same question, and she said, "Many people have written books about Sahaja Yoga, but it's yours I'm waiting for." And it was shortly after that that he found that he just sat down and the book flowed. He wrote it in one go, while before it had been kind of endless throwing out what he'd written and altering and so on. And this time, it just flowed as if it was being written through him. And that was the one which was right. He always used to get me to read the versions, and I knew that was the one when he wrote that one, because I could always feel that something was just not quite there with the other ones. I think while Chris was writing, it was also obviously working a lot on him and maybe other things. We don't know what Shri Mataji is working for. It's so subtle.

And brother, just to ask, did it also have an impact on you in your spiritual growth as well? Like the earlier books you wrote and the final one, the journey? Could you see the subtlety of writing and all that?

Yeah. Well, I feel that... how can I put it? Definitely, I suppose it coincided—the fact that when I felt ready to write it as I really always had wanted to write it. It had a lot to do with self-confidence, developing self-confidence. That's something... you can sort of feel who you are within, but being able to project it outside into the world is a much more problematic thing. I'm an introspective, introverted type of character. Other people may be able to project themselves more easily, more extrovert people.

But it did seem to be that when I had sufficiently worked on—or it wasn't really what I did, but what happened to me and experiences we went through—to the point where the ego was pretty smashed down a bit. And then the superego, which in a way was the more difficult thing. I think Shri Mataji said this, that the ego can suddenly burst like a balloon, although it will then inflate again. But the conditioning, because it has the whole of the past behind it, is a much more problematical thing to deal with for her and for us. So yes, I had to go through certain experiences for that to get sufficient detachment from conditioning, from inhibitions, and the sort of self-consciousness, that kind of thing. In order to feel, "Yeah, hell, I'm going to write this the way I want to write it. Get out of my way."

I want to share with people that although it says An Introduction to Sahaja Yoga, as I was rereading it recently, I really felt the purity of your being in the book. The genuineness, the sincerity, and the care with which you were writing these words. Words of truth, words of wisdom, words of explanation about the process of realization of Sahaja Yoga, what it means. And I could feel, as you just said, about trying to appeal to a more general audience and to touch all different kinds of seekers and backgrounds of people. I can feel that, and I can hear that and read that.

But it's not just for new people, an introduction to Sahaja Yoga, because it's filled with these beautiful stories of your experiences, you and Ruth together with Shri Mataji. How all these different experiences with her change things inside you, inside us. I felt like I'm on a journey. I'm on your journey. You're sharing in a very humble and heartfelt way your journey in Sahaja Yoga. And it was just so beautiful to read these stories about Shri Mataji. You feel so closer, and I feel deeper in myself for having shared your experiences. It just kept touching and also reminding me of our early experiences because I was in the UK with you guys too at the same time.

Absolutely. What makes Sahaja so unique and so different is that there can be so many introductions to Sahaja Yoga, so many written textbooks. But this one, Sahaja, is actually a lived experience. You're learning through lived experience. And that, I think, everyone can relate to. It actually reminds me of Gyaneshwara's work... he says in the second chapter, I think, that "This is my lived experience. I have lived through this. And I hope that this book brings to you that experience, that flow of Amrit, and that you feel my experience through my words." And so that's what I always feel through your work, uncle. And just hearing all of this, it just makes sense, because all these things that we're talking about now, I can see it translate into all the other works that you've been blessed to write.

Well, that's very, very kind. I tried to write in a way so I didn't feel, when I was rereading it, this ego, my ego. So I'm not really that humble, but I tried to be humble in the book.

Well, I think you succeeded. Very much so. What was also so sweet was that my daughter read this book, Sahaja, when she was 20, 22, quite young. And she said to me, because you said that Shri Mataji wanted a substantial book, that's what I remember her reading. And she said to me, "At last, this is a book that does justice to Shri Mataji. It is our yoga. It's articulate. It's well-written." I was just saying to her recently, last week, "I'm going to talk to Chris. We're going to talk about the book." And she said, "Do you have anything else you'd like to add?" And she said, "Yes. You can tell that he has edited and revised and he's thought about every word and he's chosen the right word that gives the right vibration, the right meaning, the right care behind it." And you've just said exactly what she felt.

And what was impressive to me, because I started in the beginning, when I was reading, I was kind of skipping through the bits about how Kundalini rises. My ego goes, "Oh yeah, yeah, I know all that." But then I stopped and I started reading it properly, and I could feel the vibrations coming in, and I could feel somehow in my own Kundalini a different understanding, a deeper understanding. And that's what's so impressive to me about the books written by Sahaja Yogis, by enlightened Sahaja Yogis, is that the vibrations that the words carry, and that the words carry these vibrations in a way that actually work on our chakras, on our Kundalinis. And really, that's what I'm hoping that we share through this series, that other people, non-Yogis and Yogis, will just go, "Oh, well, let me have a look at that." And the way you wrote it, the format is so nice. You've got lots of little chapters, so it's really easy. It's the kind of book you can read at night, and you read a couple of little chapters, and it's very nicely laid out.

Thank you. I suppose another thing I tried to do was, one can become very abstract when talking about Kundalini or the chakras and so on, or just the process of self-realization as we understand it. But I always tried to, whenever you got a concept or an idea, to supply a sort of concreteness to it by telling a story or relating it to fairy tales, which I'm fascinated by because I feel that they do articulate the unconscious in a very imaginative, poetic way. They're very deep stories, the structures of fairy tales are very deep, and they do have a lot of reference to our spiritual being. So I use them a lot. And yeah, so always to try to be concrete, and there are a lot of little stories from personal experience of mine and Ruth's with Shri Mataji.

Do you have a particular one that you could share just briefly?

Well, what could I do... I put you on the spot, sorry.

I can't... because I'll be fumbling around, but you say when she's talking to me about art and she's talking about Michelangelo... I can't find the place offhand, but how he was her favorite artist, him and Blake, which I could completely concur with. But I said, "Happy was your mother about Michelangelo," and she knew who would be. And I just thought it was very unexpected, and it made me feel much better, surprisingly. In a way, you think, "Oh God, this is a terrible world we live in," and on the contrary, "No wonder I feel typical problematic." It was actually very reassuring.

She's so real, Shri Mataji. She's always so real. Do you want to share the photos? We've got a couple of photos.

So that's me, yeah, that's when I'm, I don't know, seven, six. I can really see little Chris in your eyes. I look quite intense. Now this is my father in Hong Kong, I think, with his bear. He had a honey bear, I think it's called, which he rescued. It was in a cage in a shop and it could hardly move, so he bought it and looked after it, and it grew a bit bigger. I don't know much about him really, but I know that.

That's about the time I met Shri Mataji. Ruth took that. I met my wife when she moved into the flat below me, very convenient, of the house where you were renting your flat. And then also in that house, this is in my room there on, I think, the second time Shri Mataji came and stayed with us. And there were a lot of very deep things that happened that weekend.

Sorry, so I was feeling that maybe... do you think this is a good point to move on to the second book, Sophia?

This was a book... I suppose I was writing this concurrently with Sahaja, and actually, I finished this one earlier. So this one, how did I start writing it? It was just a few chapters. Again, it's written in quite short chapters like Sahaja, and I wasn't sure where it was going or what was going to become of it. It must have been about the time there was some programs, or one program anyway, on the Gnostics on television, which Mother also saw. And she mentioned this and how pleased she was that people were looking into these things.

Can you just explain a little bit for those who don't know who the Gnostics are?

The Gnostics were a kind of branch of early Christians. I mean, they're all mixed up and scholarship doesn't really know too much about exactly how the gospels were written and what time and so on; it's all a bit shrouded in mystery. But the Gnostics were certainly independent of Christ's teaching, but also they overlapped, and it seems that John, perhaps John the Evangelist who wrote the fourth gospel, was quite connected with these Gnostics. So Gnostics comes from the Greek word to know. They were knowers. They would have seen themselves as either enlightened or wanting to be enlightened. But when you go into what they actually wrote, there's a lot of fine stuff there, and sorting out the wheat from the chaff is always difficult.

So I wasn't trying to write a Gnostic book as such, but I was just interested in these things. I think the first impulse was to write a critical book about how Paul, St. Paul, Saul of Tarsus, had really dominated Christianity, the setting up of, or the sort of way that Christ's teachings congealed into what we know as Christianity.

Shri Mataji spoke so negatively about Paul and how he'd done more damage to Christianity than any of the other religions.

Yeah. So I thought, well A, why and how did it happen? And B, people don't know about this. There have been people who've been critical of Paul, but generally, within the church—Church of England, Catholic Church, all the churches really—Paul was regarded as definitely part of the basic setup and looked on very favorably. And there are things that he wrote which kind of make sense, but a lot of it doesn't. So I wanted to look into that, and the book was going to be negative in the sense that it was a critical book, critical of Paul.

But after a while, I thought, no, that's too negative, and it should be framed within a positive context.

So for some reason, I can't quite remember the ins and outs, but I decided to make it a book as if by John. So John the Evangelist. Not John the Baptist, who is another figure, but John the Evangelist who wrote the fourth gospel and is always credited with writing Revelation, the book of Revelations as well. He's supposed to have lived to a very old age. So I pictured him on the island of Patmos, where he's supposed to have lived later on in his life, looking back on his life, looking back on Christianity, the formation of it, looking back on his seeking, on meeting Christ, and then on Paul coming along and what happened afterwards. And his sort of message, to try to draw out what I saw as the kernel of Christianity and not all the shell or the dross. So that was it, and it was written in short chapters.

Shall I read you a bit? Would that be a good idea?

Yes, please. And Rishi also has something nice that he's going to share that he felt about the book as well after you.

Okay. I haven't looked at these books very much because when you're a writer, you look back at something you've written and you think, "Oh my God, I need to change that. That sentence has just one too many words in it." But sometimes I look at it and think, well, it's not that bad actually. Now, this one is called "Aquarius." This is a chapter quite late on in the book.

Aquarius
In this manner, things continued for some time.
I sat down at the roadside to rest. A little while passed and then, around the corner, between the almond trees, came a woman holding on her head a water jug. Unhurriedly, with dignity, she walked with her left hand swinging freely at her side so to give her balance, and her right hand steadying the jar. She was poorly dressed, a water seller I suppose, and like myself, the dust of the road was upon her. Perhaps she had found no buyers, for the highway was all but empty, and now she was returning to her hovel on the outskirts of the city.
Meanwhile a little boy, her son perhaps, came clapping his hands to a loose and graceful rhythm, half walking, half dancing side to side in front of her. To the sheepskin belt around his waist an earthenware cup was tied, while as for his bearing and face, they were those of a young king in hiding, or else perhaps in exile.
And so unhurriedly, evenly, steadily did they advance towards me through the heat rising off the road and the shimmering, blossoming almond trees, that they might have been moving to the steps of a grave and stately dance, to the music of birds and cicadas and, far off, the sea. And I, an old man, observed them until I was no longer old, neither old nor young, and no longer thought of the wounds still paining me, self-denial I had undergone to little purpose, my worries concerning the future.
At length they approached me, and with a grave and gentle expression, the boy inquired if there were anything I wished for.
My mouth was dry, and speech was difficult. "Some water, if you please," I said.
Ascending, light-hearted, composed, he ran to his mother and held out the earthenware cup for her to fill with water, which, without a glance in my direction, she did. Then just as swiftly he returned, and with the laughter of the blackbird singing, or with the laughter of the almond trees in the calm Aegean wind, or with the laughter of one who belongs completely to the present, he waved aside the coin I offered and gave me what I had asked for, saying, "This is for you."
And I looked at his mother and saw in her eyes Sophia's eyes, the Mother's eyes, looking out of the eternal present back at me, the weary traveler, with undivided love. She was looking at my spirit, so it seemed, and I too was that spirit, looking back at her. I was looking through the gate of the eternal present where she stood, or we were both in that eternal present, each gazing at the other. This was there, a little outside Ephesus, yet at the same time it was here, precisely here, in the numinous country of heaven, and I saw that this was where the divine is to be found. But as a rule, when we speak of him or worship him, we do so indirectly, in the form of a name, of a concept, and this is why men can say, "I think such and such," or, "I believe so and so about almighty God." It is why they can organize religions and develop their wishes, or why they can deny him if they wish, because they do not know the divine directly. They have not had that experience.
While everything outside that experience—the dusty road unwinding from one place to another, distant Ephesus white in the white afternoon, the heat, that aging body still belonging to a man named John, and our sufferings in Rome—those, too, seemed finally real. All these things comprised a play, a play of which the spirit was the witness, a play which the imagination of the Holy Spirit bodies forth unceasingly, and the shape of that play became known to me as though I were a child first discerning in the host of stars the outlines of the constellations.
A moment went by, and the boy and his mother passed on. I stood up, having drunk my fill, and continued on along the pathway home.

So that was... a lot of the chapters are based on the Bible and on some of the apocryphal gospels. There's a very interesting story in a book called the Gospel of Philip, who is one of the apostles. I read that book a long time ago and it seemed to me mostly kind of off; it didn't really capture the truth. So I don't know how authentic it is, but there is a story in it where Jesus goes into a dye works where they're dyeing cloth. I won't go over the story now, but I just thought this is something unique; it's not in the four gospels in the Bible. So I used that to make a story out of it. Mostly I was using biblical sources to write, but occasionally I would just invent something if it felt vibrationally true, even if it wasn't factually correct, if you see what I mean.

This image actually came from a painting we have. I mentioned my grandfather was an art dealer, and he had this painting at home for some reason, ones he kept at home rather than selling them. It's a beautiful painting, a Victorian watercolor, large—it's in the other room, a bit too big to carry through—by an English artist in Italy, touring Europe as they did in those days. It's the city of Chiusi, which is somewhere in middle or northern Italy, I think. It's a beautiful distant scene of this beautiful Italian hilltop town, and in the foreground, there is a lady with a boy in front of her, walking along the dusty road towards the viewer. That gave me, I suppose, the idea of this little image of basically the mother and Ganesha, disguised or in the guise of ordinary people, approaching John and encouraging him. It felt good; I enjoyed that because it's got more creative input in a way. I didn't want the whole book to be made up; it had to be...

But it reminded me, when I first picked it up, of Kahlil Gibran's Jesus the Son of Man.

Yes, absolutely. That was more of a problem than otherwise because I didn't want it to seem...

No, no, no! What I meant was that in Jesus the Son of Man, Kahlil Gibran imagines conversations with different people in Jesus's life, and he recreates this atmosphere, this feeling of being there in the time of Jesus. And it's very poetic, and it's short chapters, very short chapters. So the style, it reminded me of the style.

True, I'm not trying to hide this fact.

No, but because we love Jesus the Son of Man so much—this is a book that Shri Mataji had talked about, Kahlil Gibran being his inspiration... what did she say? She said he had the qualities of Blake, of the left side, this poetic inspiration. And so, to pick up your book and go, "Oh wow, this is..." that's high praise. I say that it's in the genre of Jesus the Son of Man.

I remember when I read Sophia, I had actually just finished reading Jesus the Son of Man, and then a family friend gives me Sophia and says, "I think your family should have this." So then we all actually started reading it, and it's a book that we still pick up today. Because something that Sophia has is that... actually, this is a part of all your works, but you can treat it as a book of enlightened Christianity. Because all of it is Sahaja Yoga. Everything that Jesus teaches in Sophia is Sahaja Yoga, and if a Christian reads this, they can have those kinds of experiences.

So that's exactly what I felt when I started reading it. Because in the early years when I came into Sahaja Yoga in '79, Shri Mataji talked... all her public programs in Caxton Hall, so many were filled with the truths about Jesus, about Christianity, what it was. It was like she was breaking all our conditionings, all our false ideas about Jesus, about God, about religion, about spirituality, to a Christian population. And when I started reading Sophia, I felt I would read a chapter and I would go, "Oh, that's what Mother said." You wove exactly Mother's words in, in such a seamless, natural way. And as you're reading it, you're feeling these conditionings pop out of your mind. It's like the truths set you free, the truths cleanse you. And you have put Mother's words into the book.

That's very, very kind. I had quite a Christian education. I said I went to boarding school, and every day we had a little service in the church, or the chapel as it was called, just a Church of England service, not very long. A few hymns and the reading for the day. That kind of stuff goes into you, but in a pretty positive way; it wasn't like they were trying to force it upon us. On Sundays, we had an hour long with a sermon, which was quite tedious sometimes. But it also gives you this strange, dualistic sense of Christianity because I could see that there was great truth in that, but at the same time, there's a lot of this false meaning that has grown up around it.

So it helped me, I suppose, writing that book to again sort out what I feel to be true and what is false and unnecessary. I was getting some of it photocopied at one early point in a shop, and the woman who gave it back to me... I mean, people in shops don't usually do that, but she was very stern because she was obviously some very conditioned kind of Christian, and she'd seen Indian names in it, I think. I was quite surprised. So that conditioning is out there.

Because as you say, you can't help it; you're brought up in a Christian culture, you absorb it. And that's what, in the early years, she said, "Read the Gospel of Thomas." She said, "Yes, he got it right. That's the one to read." And there's about half a dozen books that she recommended, and when I started to read them, that's when I realized the power of the words in truth, the truth of the words, because I could literally feel things popping out of my head like, "Oh, that one's gone, that one's gone." As you read the truth, it counteracts the false knowledge.

Ruth, please join us.

Mother did speak to me about Sophia when I went to do some sewing for her at Shudy Camps. I think he must have been writing it then, and she asked me about it. I said what it was about, and I said he talks about Mary as the Holy Spirit and about the negativity of Paul. And she said, "Very good, very good." And Sir C.P. was in the room at the time because I had to alter a suit for him, and she turned to him and said, "Her husband's a very good writer," which was nice.

I did talk to Mother about it once when we were on a train in Sussex. We must have been coming back from a puja, and suddenly someone said, "Come into her compartment." So I went in. Because when I moved to Italy... I mean, in England, there's very little encouragement from people, even from friends really, about this sort of endeavor to write things. But when I went to Italy, they have a lot more respect for artists and so on, and a few people—it wasn't published then—but they took it up, they were very interested. Someone paid for it to be translated into Italian. So there was a little kind of fuss about it, and that's why someone talked to me about it and brought me into the compartment with her.

And she said, "You must mention me in that book." That's the one thing. Because I hadn't... I wasn't sure about that. It wasn't that I didn't feel it was right, but I just wanted to... what kind of book is it? What is it pitched at, exactly? By bringing Shri Mataji into it, do I have to write a whole new book? But I managed to find a way that I thought was satisfying right at the very end. So it's all about Mother in a way, but specifically about Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi right at the end. And she said you should say that you got this book through your meditation, which was again very encouraging. It's legit, the right direction. And then at some point, I published it after Sahaja, I think.

In Italy, a lot of people actually read it, people who weren't necessarily Sahaja Yogis, because they were just people coming to meetings and so on, and it had a very positive effect upon a lot of them. People were saying it was good for the left Vishuddhi because a lot of them were Roman Catholics. So that was nice, we did have some response from the public.

I felt... I chose John because I suppose he's perhaps the best of the apostles. We know a bit more about him than we do about Luke, Matthew, and Mark of the four main writers of the gospels. But in a way, I always felt closer to Thomas, who is the one who is called Doubting Thomas, at least I think he is, because there were two Thomases, so it's rather confusing.

The one who wrote that Gospel of Thomas, the one Mother recommended.

Yeah, I always thought that when he... the story goes that after the resurrection, Jesus is there and Thomas wants to feel the wounds to check that this really is Jesus, who he had seen crucified. But I always felt he's doing that not because he doesn't believe, but it's a sort of scientific thing. He wants to prove so he can say to other people, "I was there, I felt them, it's real."

Mother did speak to me about Doubting Thomas, strangely enough. When I again went to London to help with some sewing, I was there for four days. The program on the Gnostics was on the television at the time, and she started talking about Thomas to me at random. And she said he was a good man, but he was weak. So that was quite interesting.

But was he the one... no, no, that was... I was thinking because Mother had said how Jesus came and walked around England, but that was with his uncle, Joseph of Arimathea.

There's another book about Thomas where he describes—I mean, this is known, I think—that he went to India. He went to spread the word to, I think, southern India. There's a bit at the beginning of it, I can't remember exactly how it goes, where I think Jesus maybe appears in a dream to him and says, "I want you to go to India." And he says, "Oh no, do I have to?" I can imagine feeling that, actually. And it would be a long way in those days. And of course, it ended up badly for most of them.

Interestingly enough, actually, my ancestry is from Kerala. And in Kerala, there's the largest population of Christians in India, and they call themselves Saint Thomas Christians still. So that's an interesting point.

Funny enough, just around the corner from us, there is an old Methodist chapel which has been taken over by these Saint Thomas Indian Christians. And we see them there on Sunday, and it's quite unusual, you know, Indian but Christian.

Another thing, where I lived when I was a child in Surrey, there was a church, the nearest church, that had some columns in it that came from Ephesus, this place where John lived for a time. So that was a sort of faint connection again with John and Ephesus and so on. You don't know where these ideas come from, but they sort of come into your head and then gradually either they come into a project and you actually realize that project, or they don't. They're still sitting in the back room of the brain, as many other ideas are which I hope to get out.

Well, it's interesting because it's divinely inspired, but then one has to put the desire to actually write the book and to realize it. And then Shri Mataji comes and gives you, through your meditation, when you have this desire, then she can inspire you. But you actually have to act on it, don't you?

Yes, you have to. And the other thing she said in that train journey when she was talking about this was, "Don't worry," because this was at a time when that writer, what's his name, Salman Rushdie, published that book about Muhammad and received death threats.

He received a fatwa, actually. A fatwa went on his head.

Yeah. I don't know much of his writings, the little bits I read. But she said, "Don't worry, they won't get after you like they're getting after him."

Ruth, do you have any other stories? As the wife of a writer, it's hard. It's hard to be a writer because you have to be very focused.

She's been your Shakti.

Yes, she has. And I've been very devoted to this work.

You have to be true to what you feel to be your path or your gift. You have to. You can't betray it. That's the worst thing, because you will be unhappy, and you'll make everyone else unhappy. And you'll die, and you'll probably hang around feeling you haven't realized your purpose. So I've had that feeling that you've got to, if you can, in whatever measure.

I did have an interesting dream early on in my marriage to Chris, where Mother was really saying, I feel, that I had to do this work of supporting Chris. It was in my old house, and in the dream, there's a kind of driveway going up, and I was standing at the bottom of the driveway, and Shri Mataji appeared at the top of the driveway. I remember she had the sun behind her head. I had a nappy bucket and I was collecting earth from the garden in the nappy bucket. And she did namaste to me and said, "Thank you for doing this work for me." And just thinking about it afterwards, I realized that the work was... because I knew in the dream, that's right, I knew that this earth had something to do with Chris's writing. I actually was conscious of that. I was preparing it for Chris's writing somehow or other. So I felt she was saying, "This is important work, and you have to do it, and you're doing it, you know, and I'm getting you to do it. I want you to do it." And it was beautiful. She was clearly up above me, so even though she did the namaste, it was like... and of course, in the dream, I'll do it back.

I'm very fortunate because, being married, Ruth has done a lot for my left side, obviously. This is marriage. And so I think it's definitely enabled me to be a better writer and more balanced, which is what I've always wanted to try to do. So I could go on, but it would be embarrassing.

It's a real team. It's been a team effort.

And Ruth, because you said you've read... you usually read the proof copies?

Yes, I've read almost all of them, I think. Except the ones he's writing now, not ready yet.

Well, as you mentioned, Chris, we are going to have a second session with you, not today, to talk about two of the other books... that Shri Mataji also directly inspired and encouraged you with. But before we say goodbye, I just wanted, Rohan or Rishi, if you had any other questions or anything? Rishi, you said something very beautiful about the book Sophia you wrote to me when we were going to do this.

I guess what I sent you was that every chapter is like distilled vibrations. And when you raise your Kundalini and read this, then you get that vat of vibrations, and it just fills you up. It's Sahaja literature. And there's this Chinese concept... I feel like everything in Sophia is like naturalness. Everything just flows so naturally. One question I actually wanted to ask is that all these chapters are distilled, that's what I was saying. And so I was wondering just how you got the idea of each chapter and how your meditations were when you were writing them.

It's hard because partly it's quite a long time ago. But some of the ideas, like the one that's based on that painting I've got, that's where at least the sort of concrete image came from. But I think the impulse to write something about John returning and coming into a new phase of his life towards the end of his life was there from within. And then the painting gave me a concrete image to tie it to. Art breeds art. Different ideas coming from different directions, and some definitely more intellectual.

You also talk about a musician, which as a musician, that really touched my heart. You have this chapter called "The Musician," and he plays the dulcimer.

That's right.

And I play the santoor, which is... right. So that chapter meant so much to me, uncle. I can't tell you how much it meant. After reading that chapter, I just went to the santoor again, and I just proclaimed that Jesus loves this instrument.

I mean, it's made up, but I felt it had a sort of reality to it. I wasn't trying to be historically accurate.

And that bit that you read was so visual. I could just see myself there. I was going to ask you if you'd ever been to Israel or Lebanon, you know, the places of Jesus, because I have, and it just brought it back. But see, this is the beauty of inspiration. This is divine inspiration, and we see this in Kahlil Gibran. And I think we should, as writers and as Yogis, we should have confidence that, yes, it might not be, as you say, historically accurate, but vibrationally...

Oh, that was completely vibrationally, yeah.

So what I was trying to say was that we should have confidence that if you're in that state, if it's flowing thoughtlessly... I feel like these deep inspirations come through us when we're thoughtless, and we have to have confidence that this is the divine speaking through us. And if it has vibrations, if people respond to it, if it feels like it has truth, then it has truth. That's what the vibrations are about.

And I think people will understand that... I explain at the beginning, it's a poetic interpretation. It's like a performance of a raga. It doesn't stay the same, but every performance is original. So that's what I tried to do in that book.

Rohan, did you want to...

I haven't read... I've got the copy, but before we have you here next, I'm pretty sure I'll be able to read it. I've had lots of personal stories from brother when we meet, but it's really nice to hear from someone who's been in search for so long and directly with Shri Mataji. Mother came and stayed at their place and everything, so it's really nice to hear all about that.

And so many of those stories are in the Sahaja book. You have put in these incidents with Mother in Bristol, so it's almost like a little history of Shri Mataji.

I tried to make... put lots of stories in but make them applicable to everyone, you know. It's easier to say, "Well, Mother, it was lovely being with Mother, blah blah blah," but there's a point to them. They're placed in the book in a certain place to enlighten, like you talk about the Zen stories that you experience.

I feel like we could just keep talking for quite some time. We've all enjoyed this so much, and it's so kind of you to take your time to share with us. We are going to do another part to talk about the other books. And for us young Sahaja Yogis, for this new generation like myself, it's such a blessing and such an honor to be a part of this. You are our elders, and so we look up to you so much.

What impresses me about you young people is how articulate you are when you speak. There's a gravity, there's a depth and an articulateness, and it gives us great joy in our hearts to see this new generation coming up. So we're all enjoying this together.

Shall we close? Thank you very much.

Thank you so much.
