It's interesting when you look back after you've gotten Realization because you see all the little events that led up to this point, as if Mother's just pulling you there. When I was 14, I started reading poetry and I felt, "I want to be one with God, I want to be one with God." It sort of came and went, and I had some difficult times. I went to college at 18 and I thought, "What am I doing here? I want to be with God. This is such a waste." I remember I got out the Bible and thought, "I'll find God here." I opened the Bible and then thought, "No, I won't find God here."

I was really feeling desperate. Then, like Pam, I felt this voice come into me and say, "Don't worry, when the time is right, I will come for you." So I just went, "Okay," and I relaxed. I went to university, overworked myself, and then I left college and thought, "Now it's my time. I'm going to find the joy that I felt I'd lost. I'm going to find myself."

I earned money and went off traveling. I was going to go to Australia. I left London, thinking, "I'm never coming back here again. I don't like the city at all." I went off and ended up traveling around India for five months. I was really looking for a yogi in a cave, or something. I kept meeting all these people who'd met false gurus like Rajneesh and others, and each one had a really bad experience to tell me. I thought, "Oh, I'm not going there."

Finally, one day I was in the jungle in a wildlife sanctuary. Someone on my travels had given me a copy of the Upanishads, this beautiful book translated by a realized soul. I started reading it, and it's the poetry of their experiences of union with God. I thought, "This is what I want. I want to feel this. I want to feel this joy." The next day, I met someone in my hotel who had just come from a public program with Shri Mataji.

I had this strange feeling that I must ask people if they'd been anywhere or seen anyone. I was a bit shy, but I thought, "No, no, you've got to ask them." So they gave me this leaflet, "Sahaja Yoga: A Unique Discovery." I didn't understand a word of it; it was very intellectual, about parasympathetic systems. But it said that Mother could cure physical problems. At that time, I didn't realize it, but I had anorexia and insomnia, which I felt was really getting in the way of my leading a balanced life.

I found out where Shri Mataji was going to be and, to leave out some details, I went to Delhi. I arrived just at the beginning of the week-long lectures she was giving. I went to the place, and Shri Mataji was there and I met her. But my chakras at this time were so blocked. I stayed for the program, and they gave me my Realization. I didn't really feel anything. I felt like something shot up my arm, and that was it. They said, "Oh, you've got it. Go bow down." So I went to Shri Mataji, and she said, "Very good. Left Nabhi." Then she asked me if I was vegetarian, which I wasn't.

I went home. I got in a rickshaw and went back to the hotel. I sat down to have supper, and for the first time in four years, I ate my meal. There were no thoughts in my head of, "Don't eat this. You'll get fat." This is what anorexia does; it talks to you the whole time. And I went, "Oh, wow. That feels really nice." Then I went to sleep, and I felt like I'd slept for 14 hours, but it had only been eight. I thought, "My goodness, there's something special here."

You have your desire, but she pulls you in and gives you what you're looking for at that time. It's like she knows, "Okay, this is your hook. This is your lure." So I went back again to the next program. But I couldn't go every night; physically, I couldn't handle the vibrations. I wanted to go, but I couldn't. I would just literally spend the day waiting for the next day, and then I'd go to the program. Everyone was very kind and tried to work on me. In fact, Shri Mataji at this point gave me neck cricks and said, "Just vishuddhi, vishuddhi." I didn't feel anything.

But I really liked the yogis. I'd been traveling for seven months at this point with lots of other young people. I wasn't a hippie, but I was kind of on the hippie trail. And it was the first time I felt, "These are people like me." I can't explain it any other way, but I just felt this connection. I was also impressed. Bob Dunn was there, who was a doctor, and I thought, "This is someone like me, and he thinks there's something special here."

I kept going for four or five days, and it was very nebulous. I felt there was something special here, but I didn't know what it was. I can see this is very much a period where people come in, get Realization, and it's so easy to get pulled off. I could feel things trying to tell me, "Oh, go here, go there." But something stronger was pulling me towards Shri Mataji.

They said, "We're having a seminar in Bordi." I'm sure it was Douglas who said, "Come to the seminar." Apparently, everyone said, "Oh, Mother, she's so caught up," and Shri Mataji said, "Don't worry. She'll be all right." So sweet. Mother knew in your heart who you were.

So I went. We were at Bordi. There were only about 30 yogis; it was just Sahaja Yoga in England and in India in 1979. Shri Mataji was sitting at the front, and all the yogis were standing in a bandhan facing her. It's an old treatment she had. We would put our sahasraras like this, and Chris would have his hand on my sahasrara, and the person on the left-hand side would have their hand towards Shri Mataji, taking vibrations. It would go all the way around the half-circle. She asked, "Is everybody feeling vibrations in both hands?" Suddenly, for the first time, I realized, "Yes, I'm feeling cool down my right, but nothing in the left. Absolutely nothing."

She called me. "Come out and sit in front of me." So I knelt down. She said, "Put your hand on your heart and ask the question: 'Shri Mataji, is this the power of the Holy Spirit? Is this the power of the Paramchaitanya?'"

Suddenly, there was this cold breeze coming towards me, and it was like, whoosh, my kundalini must have just gone boing. I felt this huge weight fall off my shoulders. You know, they say "the weight of the world on your shoulders"—that's what it felt like, like boom. Suddenly, it was like I was awake and up in the world and sort of alive. I felt it was kind of amazing. I was in this new experience. Over the next couple of hours, I felt like I got my soul back again. I suddenly felt like writing poetry. The whole of my left side opened up.

Still, I never felt anything in my hands. At that point, I realized this was it. I felt like I was swimming in this water, and Shri Mataji was up there and she had put this straw down, and if I just held on to this straw, I'd be all right. She said, "Come back to London," which I had vowed never to go near again, because there was only Sahaja Yoga in India and in London at the time. I felt if I could learn to live in London through Sahaja Yoga, then I could learn to live anywhere. I was very impressed with the Indian Sahaja Yogis because they had so much joy and love, and I felt, "This is what I want."

I wanted to share that it doesn't matter if you don't feel vibrations in your hands, because I didn't for like six months. I never felt anything. But I did feel things inside. She would say—because I had a lot of problems when I came; I was very blocked in my chakras—she would say, "Look at Felicity. Look how she's come up." So I always say, if I could do it, anyone can do it. You should never feel there's a problem with you. It's just surface, and you just give patience and time, and it comes out.

One time she said to me, "Whatever your problems, Felicity, you are always sincere and honest." And I felt that's the key. If you can just be honest with yourself and be sincere, Mother works everything out.
