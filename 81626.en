I think I was going mad, probably. And very sick. But sometimes I was well; it was on and off. Sometimes very well, sometimes not at all.

Of course, meeting Mother is the greatest day of my life. It's something for which, still today, I'm very thankful to God—to have that chance to meet Shri Mataji and also the chance to somehow understand who she is on that meeting. Otherwise, I could have lost everything because Shri Mataji was going to go away the next day. So time was short. I think Shri Mataji and God made it easy for me. It had to be such that I had to understand it there and then.

So, there was a certain preparation before meeting Mother. Once, I was on a motorbike and had a head-on collision with a car. The moment the motorbike hit the car, my body was up in the air. During that time, I was up in the air. I knew I was going to die. And in that split second, I saw my whole life since birth, since I was born—something one cannot remember when you are a baby—up to that day. Then I saw my own funeral. I saw my parents weeping over my body. Each and every person I have met in my whole life was there to see. And an angel up in the air told me, "What a big waste of a life." A life which really had a purpose. It was really wrong. And the next thing I hear, a big bang. This was the bang of my helmet on top of the bonnet of the car. And then I fell on the floor. Not a scratch. Nothing. A very strange feeling. How can someone see his whole life from beginning to end, including my own funeral, in less than a split of a second? So that was like an awakening experience.

Then one day, I was in bed at 4 a.m. My parents arrived home. I woke up and they showed me a glance of the picture of Shri Mataji. They said, "Look, look at what we have found." And I said, "Wow." I went to sleep. In those days, of course, because I was very ill, I was always praying to Christ to send the dove, the dove of the Holy Ghost, to land on top of my head. That's something I was always praying for because I knew I needed divine salvation. There was no way I could get out of that situation. But even though I prayed and prayed and prayed, nothing happens, as you probably know from experience, isn't it?

But that night, after seeing a glance of Shri Mataji, I don't know why, when I woke up, there was a voice in my head. And I just knew this was the voice of Christ, but I wasn't for sure. The words were, "I was hungry and you didn't give me any food. I was naked and you gave me no clothes. You didn't come to see me. I was in jail and you didn't come to see me either." Those words kept coming in my mind, very loud. And I knew, oh my goodness, these are the words of Christ, of course.

Then I realized, yes, of course, my cousin was in jail and I had refused to go and see him in jail for two years. He was my age, but he had done some drug offenses and I said, "No way, I'm not going to visit him." And then I realized, my goodness, what a selfish person I am, not minding the fact I'm hurting my parents, my aunt, my cousin. I just don't care for other people. All I care is for myself. I'm really the most selfish, absurd person.

So, luckily, I had this thought: I want to go and see my cousin in jail at last. My parents said, "My God, what happened to you? Did you have an epiphany? We've been telling you this for two years. What is this?" "Well, I don't know. I have to go and see him today."

That was my luck, because I went to see my cousin in jail that day for the first time, and on the way back, my parents went to see Shri Mataji again. So, I was with them. That was my chance at last to see Shri Mataji. However, my girlfriend was an atheist and a communist, and she refused to go. Shri Mataji was staying in a place where you had to go up many stone steps. I don't know what came to me. I said, "Okay, you have to go. That's it." So, I forced her up the steps, really by force. It was hurting her arm. So, she had to come as well.

We arrived there. I was sitting in a small room. This is like an old castle, that place, a very ancient building. And that room has no windows where they told us to wait for Mother. To go into the room, you have to go down some little steps of stone. And the door is so small, like in the ancient buildings, that to go inside, you have to bend down a little bit, at least for my height, to go inside that room, down the steps. Once you are in the room, it's like a cell. You cannot get out of there. And we were waiting there for Shri Mataji. Shri Mataji was having a siesta. And all my family with me there in that room.

Then I saw some people passing through. These were people—I know those guys. They were Sahaja Yogis, but I had met them with other false gurus. I didn't believe I would come to a place like this to meet these guys. I jumped out of that room and went after them. As I went after them, I saw a lady coming out of a room, totally disheveled. The sari was not... Mother just came out of siesta, you see. I saw Mother from a distance, and at the glance of her, I had the same motorbike experience. Instead of seeing my whole present life, I saw all the past lives and could see that Shri Mataji had been my personal mother all my lives. That's what that vision gave. So, there you are. Mother made it very easy for me to know that she is the Mother of the Universe. I knew I had met Christ at last. That's what I wanted. It was an emergency because Mother was going away the next day.

But then Mother came to the room, that little room where we were standing with my family. Shri Mataji arrived at the room. She looked. And I was back there in the room, sitting there next to my parents and my girlfriend. "Who is that?" The first thing Shri Mataji said was, pointing at that girl, my girlfriend, "Who is that woman? What is she doing here?"

I lost my tongue. And Shri Mataji looked at me. "You can translate." She knew that I knew English. I had been studying English for two years. I was really amazed. My goodness, she even knows that. I said, "Who is that woman? What is she doing here?" I said, "It's my..." I couldn't find the word. And I said, "My girlfriend." "My what?" "My girlfriend. Girlfriend." "No, no, I don't know 'girlfriend.' That doesn't exist." I said, "You know, girlfriend." "No, no, it's indecent. It's absurd. It's obscene." Then she asked, "Do you really love her?" Big silence. I couldn't say I did, because I didn't. You see, how Mother knew everything. "If you don't love her, then stop it. This is indecent. It's very gross. It's appalling." That was the introduction.

And then she went to work on my relatives, who also had diseases. She came again. "Come on, you translate." So I moved next to Mother to translate. Then Mother gave realization. And after realization, Mother decided to work on each and every person. People made a queue. I was in a rush to go and be treated by Mother. So every time my turn came, Mother said, "Sir, go back. Go to the back of the queue." And I went to the back of the queue. Then I lost patience and I started jumping the queue. I appeared again. "Sir, go to the back of the queue." Two or three times Mother said, "Go to the back of the queue."

At last, there was no one left. Only me. Then Mother worked on me. And I was so ill that, I think... I can't measure time in those situations, but Mother must have worked on me for 40 minutes or so. It was serious. So that's why I had to be the last one. Otherwise, the people in the queue would have to wait so long. At the end of those 40 minutes, suddenly, without telling me, she did this neck click. Boom, she twisted my neck to one side. A big noise in the spine. That was incredible. And then suddenly, bang, she clicked the head in the opposite direction.

Then, without telling me, she picked up from her handbag a thing called Netranjan. I don't know how to say it properly. It's a kind of very strong eye medicine. And she put a massive amount in each eye. At that moment, I went blind. Totally blind. But it was so blissful, so blissful that I said, "I don't mind. I like it." It was fantastic. And that was the strongest experience of self-realization I cannot describe. Even though I was blind. Most people who were blind can now see. I could see, and now I'm blind. But it was absolutely a tremendous experience.

By now it was about 2 a.m. She said, "I'm going to go to Spain tomorrow. So if you want to see me, very, very first thing in the morning before I go to take the flight, you can come and see me." I said, "Fine, I'll come, of course." It was already 2 a.m. "What time shall I come?" She said, "Very early, very early. Early morning, please come. And I'll see you before going." I said, "Yes, early, but exactly what hour?" She says, "Well, early, just come early." I said, "Yes, I understand, but exactly what hour, please?" I thought it was very strange she wouldn't tell me the exact hour to come, like an appointment. So I said, "Well, you see, I don't want to come so early to wake you up or disturb you. What time do you get up?" She said, "I get up at 4 a.m." "So when shall I come? After you get up?" "Yes." So I said, "That means 4 a.m., isn't it?" "Yes."

So I came at 4 a.m., except I didn't manage to make it at 4 a.m. My motorbike broke down, ran out of petrol, so I had to run. All the way to try and reach there at 4 a.m. I arrived at 5 a.m., pouring in sweat. I banged on the door and banged. Then Maria Amelia came and opened the door, dressed in her pajamas, at 5 a.m. "What happened to you?" I was pouring sweat, my suit was totally drenched. I had run for an hour to be on time. I was one hour late. "In fact, I'm very late to see Mother. It's 5 a.m. I'm here now. Tell her that I've just arrived." She said, "You need to meditate. So sit down." "Okay, so how do I meditate?" "Very simple. You see that photograph there? You just look at it." I was really offended. I came here to see the lady herself, and you are giving me a photograph. Is this what you call meditation? She said, "Try it, try it." Well, I tried it. And that really was a very special meditation without Mother in person. I must have stayed one hour in meditation.

Then I got up. I didn't know what to do, so I cooked Mother breakfast. And I cooked all the wrong diet, of course, because she was on a special diet. Everything I cooked was wrong. So Maria Amelia said, "I'm sorry, but you better eat it." I said, "No way. Give it to her and tell her this is a Portuguese breakfast. She might like it." So Maria Amelia said, "All right, fair enough." And she ate the whole breakfast, the Portuguese breakfast, even though it was not her diet at all. So that was also a special moment.

Then at last, Shri Mataji met me, and she said, "So now can you feel the vibrations?" Because I had been meditating. And I said, "No." So Shri Mataji, sitting from a distance of about three meters, she said, "All right, what about now? Can you feel the vibrations?" And she was throwing the vibrations at me. My God, that was like a cool breeze and a big wind. And I said, "No." And then she started blowing it. Every time she blew it, it was like having a bath. "Can you feel the vibrations now?" I said, "No." By then Maria Amelia was getting very irritated. "Come on, come on. What's wrong with you?" And Mother kept on, "All right, let's try again." She again blew the vibrations. "Can you feel the vibrations?" I said, "No." Of course, I was feeling it. Mother said, "I know you can feel it." And I said, "It's not vibrating. I'm waiting for it to actually vibrate and shake." And Mother said, "Oh, I see. It's a translation problem." The word "vibration" in Portuguese, you expect it to vibrate. So when I admitted, "Yes, I can feel the vibrations," then Mother said, "In that case, you can come with me to the airport. We'll take you in my car. You can come in my car." So great, I'll come to the airport with Mother.

As Mother entered the car, everybody got in the car, and then I was just getting inside the car, and the dog gets inside and takes my place. It sits next to Mother. A big dog. That's where I was supposed to sit, next to Mother. And Mother, she picks the dog by the collar and starts pushing the dog out of the car. And the dog went grrr, really at Mother's hand. Mother pushed the dog again, and the dog growled. And then she looked at me. "Well, Luis, you see, I tried. I did my best. The thing is that this dog also recognized me. There's nothing I can do. Why don't you take the bus?"

So I went to the bus. I arrived at the bus stop. I didn't have any money. And my motorbike had run out of petrol miles away. I really felt stupid here, waiting for the bus without any money to go to the airport. But that's what Mother told me to do. Suddenly, another Sahaja Yogi comes. I knew them. Oh, my God, this is the solution. "Have you got a bit of spare change? I need to go to the airport." They looked in their pockets. "Good gracious, I don't even have enough to go on the bus myself." "Okay, well, what shall we do?" "Well, Mother told you to go by bus. You go by bus." Okay, fine. I wait a bit longer. A third Sahaja Yogi comes. "Have you got a bit of spare money?" They check their pockets. "Good gracious. I don't have enough money for myself also." Three Sahaja Yogis now, if you count me, all waiting for the bus to go to the airport without money.

I thought, this is mad. We need to do something about it. And they told me, "Oh, no. In Sahaj, this is not how it works. You don't worry about things. You just give it a bandhan." "Really? And that's how you go on the bus without money?" "Yes, you just give it a bandhan." All right? I gave it a bandhan. Suddenly, one of the yogis says, "A taxi passing through. I know that guy." He stops the taxi. "This guy is a good friend of my brother." He said, "Okay, let's get in. We are lucky. What a miracle."

We go in the taxi. They start talking. Oh, my God. That was not the friend of his brother. Looks like it. And in Portugal, the taxi drivers, usually they have a cricket bat under the seat if you don't pay the fare. So I said, "We are going to die. One of us is going to die today." They said, "Oh, no. In Sahaj, this is not how we do things. You just give it a bandhan." I said, "Really?" So we gave lots of bandhans. We had waited about 40 minutes at the bus stop—first me, then another yogi, then another yogi, then the taxi. We must have started about 40 minutes after Mother. We are going for our death now. One of us is going to die. This is the day.

We arrive at the airport. Now what are we going to say? I said, "Shall we all run away? Each one in a different direction, because one of us might escape." He said, "No, no, no. We just give it a bandhan. We have to have faith." We gave it another bandhan. The taxi stops. We look to the car next door. It was the car of Shri Mataji. Inside the car, there was a very rich doctor. He paid for the taxi. Dr. Rushdam. He paid for it. There was really a close brush with death again.

There were many incidents. At the airport, Shri Mataji worked on a man who was going bald. She rubbed some of the amla hair oil on the head of that man. I felt jealous. I was getting bald also. I wish Mother had given me a bit of that oil on my head. But I couldn't say it. Mother was about to leave. So Mother went. And then later on, Maria Amelia comes back. "Oh, look, Mother gave you this bottle of amla oil for you." So... Mother made it easy for us to see that even small thoughts, she knew everything.
