There is a self-driven power inside us which is called the Autonomous Nervous System in English. It's located subtly in the medulla oblongata, inside the spinal cord in our back. I told you that these are the three subtle powers which make our Autonomous Nervous System work. Those two powers which are on the left and right, one is called Ida and the other Pingala and the one in the middle is called Sushumna. They are the three channels and the three powers on these three channels are namely, the one on the left side is Mahakali, the one on the right is Mahasaraswati and the one in the middle is Mahalakshmi. Our existence and dissolution is due to Mahakali Shakti, our body is formed by Mahasaraswati as well as all our thinking work/thought process - whatever suggestions we have for the future, whatever planning we do, we think, we implement, whatever creative capacities we have, are all displayed and manifested through it. And the power in between which we call the power of Mahalakshmi, in which the people of this city of Bombay believe very much, it is through this Mahalakshmi power that our evolution takes place. We have evolved from amoeba to the human form today because of this power only. Because of this power we sustain ourselves; Dhaarana means to sustain. The qualities of every single substance, as I told you yesterday that carbon has four valencies, the nature of every single substance, or it's, what we say, properties all come through this power and the sustenance of religion in a human being is also due to this. A human being does also have some religion/attributes of his own, otherwise why would he be called a human being?

He has ten attributes/virtues, which can in a simpler way be said, that the Ten Commandments in the Bible are those ten virtues. These ten dharmas have many more subtle forms about which we have mention in our scriptures since ancient times. Many saints and sages found out and have written a lot on it. The last thing I was telling you yesterday about Dharma, because while describing the three Chakras, when we came to the navel chakra, I said that Lakshmiji has a very close connection with dharma because religion is in our stomach. Religion is not in the thought/mind. The person who practices religion with the mind is not religious. Religion is not through thoughts, it is in our stomach. Like, I tell you a simple thing, that if there is a truly religious man, that is, one who should be called a realized soul - I don't consider that person religious who walks around with a big mark or badge but one who is a dedicated person from within, one who has become one with God, who is a Yogi in the true sense, who is a realized soul, if that person goes to the house of someone who has committed murder and harassed people, as soon as he eats food at that man's house, he will start vomiting. He will not be able to bear it. He will not be able to see any naked woman.

As soon as he sees her, he will feel like vomiting. His stomach won't be able to bear it. There must be many people among you who can't even eat food at someone else's house. Going to their houses, they will definitely feel like vomiting. No one can tell the reason for this. The simple reason is that your religion[dharma] is not compatible with the religion which is in that house. You may also have experienced many such things in your life for which you might not have found the answer. When our Dharma becomes weak or when man's Dharma starts declining, the moment his religion starts declining, gradually he starts compromising with life. When his compromise begins, he gradually becomes weak. As soon as he becomes weak, sometimes some evil spirits also come upon him.

Sometimes he himself becomes a evil spirit. When man falls from Dharma, he can only descend into the devilish/subhuman form. Because now he can neither be born as an animal nor can he be born as a deity. So being a human when he falls/strays from his religion then where will he go? He has to go to the demonic form or he has to go to the state of Hell. Now whether Hell exists or not, is there any proof of this or not, what is it's proof, Mataji please show us scientifically. So that cannot be done, but yes, for sure it is, that I showed it to you even today morning and yesterday too, I showed you the pulsation of the Kundalini, which you can see. You can see the pulsation of the Kundalini with your own eyes, even though you have not been realized yet. And those who have been realized have also experienced the peace about which I am talking, that thoughtlessness where a person becomes silent and within him all his thoughts stop and he becomes a witness and starts watching. This happening takes place.

What scientific proof can be given for what happens inside you? Suppose you are listening to some nice, beautiful music and you say you are enjoying it give some scientific proof for this, then how can it be given? You become, this happens within you, and cool vibrations start flowing through you. This happened to many among you yesterday and you experienced it too and many people must have benefited from it too and should move ahead in this. Those people who have understood this matter deeply and have moved forward have reached great heights today. While living in this world, they have become superior to many sages and saints, and how many people they are giving realization, and curing many of them also. Even diseases like cancer - we have a simple school teacher here, he has cured cancer of so many people. And he is a very accomplished man, although he is a very simple teacher. He has reached great heights and in Kundalini Shastra, he is absolutely very [wise and] knowledgeable. He has acquired so much knowledge about Kundalini Shastra that you'll be surprised as to where this man has gained so much knowledge from.

You have not known anything till now. When you start knowing, then whatever deep/profound knowledge there is, everything starts flowing from within because first there must be the power to know. One who doesn't have the power to know - if you do not have the power to listen, then how will you understand what I am saying. If you don't have the power to see, then how will you be able to see what I'm showing you? Therefore this cannot happen without your consciousness becoming subtle first. Yesterday a gentleman came and told me, "My brother's sickness, one of your disciples was not able to cure," and I have no faith in You," So I said, "If you don't even have any faith in Me, then what brought you here?" "If I cure your brother, you will have faith in Me; What compulsion is this." "I have not taken any money from you, what right do you have over Me, that you can tell Me, 'I should cure your brother.'" You are saying to Me with so much authority, " Awaken my Kundalini," so what right do you have after all? Your right is that you have accepted Me as your Mother, you have faith in Me, otherwise, I have nothing to take from you, nor can you give Me anything.

But if you don't have faith at all, then you just think, all these Deities sitting on the chakras, will they accept the fact that you have absolutely no faith in Me, no faith in these Gods, you don't have faith in God, you abuse everyone morning-evening, and will they run around and work for you? If there is an ordinary officer, then he has so much protocol, then how much protocol will that God Almighty have! We have become so egoistic that we think that, "Our Kundalini should be awakened, this should happen for us, that should happen for us, and we have absolutely no faith in God, we are big shots," - so be where you are. It is very difficult for such people to get realization. Let me tell you before hand. It is important that you come with faith. Farmers have a lot of faith. I had gone to Rahuri, I was surprised thousands of people had come; Crowds of five-five, six-six thousand were getting realization just like that. (UNCLEAR) was saying, "What kind of sons of Mother Earth are they, how quickly they are getting it." There were some educated people, some rich people too - it was not that they were all completely illiterate - there were some illiterate people too, but everyone was getting realization very quickly.

So I asked them, "What is the matter?" They said, "Mother, we have great reverence for You." So I asked, "Why do you have faith?" They replied, "We do have. We are farming people." "How can we do farming without faith? Farming cannot be done without faith." It is correct. Farming can't be done without faith. When a man thinks about how the land/earth makes a seed grow, on her own She gives us so many fruits and doesn’t want us to give her anything.

Seeing it, man is certainly amazed and realizes what a great miracle it is, what a great wonder it is! And when we go to the market here and buy things, we take it for granted. We don't feel that something special is happening or is a miracle. Having faith in God is a natural thing, very natural, because whatever we have got, just think; today we have become human beings from an amoeba, we have not evolved on our own. God Himself has incarnated in the world many times. - He took ten incarnations in the world and in those ten Incarnations, He has worked very hard in every Incarnation and has helped you people to reach to this state. This is correct. Whether it is or not we will later make you realize. We told you yesterday itself that as a scientist, you just keep your minds open. After that we will show you each and every thing.

Before such an Almighty God we must come with our heads bowed down. The person who thinks himself to be higher than God should stay at his place. But he is in one sense. God has made man higher than Himself. This is true in one sense, where even God is at a loss and I also am. That is, God has given you freedom. You have to choose your own evolution when you come to the level of a human being, upon reaching this plane, you will have to search it in your freedom. We cannot force you, that if we want we enchant you, that we make you unconscious, that we put you in a trance, that we befool you, it cannot happen like this. You have to choose it, you have to take this decision in full consciousness, in full awareness, this has to be accepted that, 'Yes, I am going to go on the path of God, I want to know the power of God.' Only then will it happen.

In this sense you are the highest. This question does not arise in other creatures, this question is of human beings. And that is why God bows down before man bcause his evolution, his development, on reaching this state, just can't happen without freedom. Because if I want to make you kings, then only in your freedom can I make you kings. If you yourself are dependent, and if you are doing something because of Me, then how can we make you a king. This is the greatest liberation, the greatest freedom, and for the greatest liberation, first the intellect of man must be somewhat free. His decision should be made freely. Every person should in complete freedom must accept that, 'Yes, we want this.' Absolute faith means absolute freedom. Yesterday I told you about the three chakras - today many new people have come - and among them I told that Mooladhara Chakra is at the bottom.

It contains the power of Shri Ganesha, which is Eternal Childhood. And the important point of this I told is that the Mooladhar, which is of The Goddess, of Gauriji, or what should be called the triangular place of Kundalini Shakti - is below it, not above it, it is below it. So if Kundalini has to be raised, then the Mooladhara Chakra, which controls sex, should not be touched. Mooladhara Chakra is related to sex because Shri Ganesha is a small child and He, small children, do not know anything regarding this. They are innocent, they have innocence. Sex has no role to play in the Kundalini awakening or in the evolution of humans. He is already sublimated. But man at this time has an opposite relationship. It is such that when he spreads his hands in front of God and desires that his Kundalini be awakened, he should know that Kundalini is my Mother. She is my Holy Mother who is forever with me.

And he should have thoughts towards Her like an extremely pure child, just like Shri Ganesha had towards Gauri Ji. Later on, Tantrikas came to our country and negated the efforts/did the opposite. If I get time someday, I will tell you about tantric as well, but the thing is, that by doing such negative things they have spread total destruction in this country. But whatever is the Truth, remains indestructible and persists. Our country, India, is the real land of Yoga. This is such a huge land of Yoga that no falsehood can last long here. This thing is correct and that is why this work can be done in this country even today. Otherwise, many attempts have been made in this country to break the sanctity of this country but it could not be broken. Many people did. Uptil now there have been such people who are spreading bad things.

But this country could not break down in the way other Western countries got completely destroyed. How amazing it is that this sacred relationship between mother and son still exists in our country! I told you about our second chakra, Swadhisthana Chakra, through which we do all our creative work and whose power is Saraswati. The third chakra, I told you was of Lakshmi ji and Narayan, i.e. Vishnu ji. In the space formed around this chakra, Brahmaji has created the entire universe. And this universe which has been created in today's condition/stage is called Bhavsagar. It has many conditions, stages - in this stage it is called Bhava Sagar. That is why we say that 'Make us cross the ocean of illusion, save us from the ocean of illusion' - the world is an ocean, whatever has happened, the ocean remains. In this ocean, this world in which we have come and this world in which we are living, this should be called Bhavasagar.

And it is also true that presently it is Kalyug. Now it is Kalyug, a very terrible kind of Kalyug, and simultaneously the Satyug has also begun. Kaliyug is going on, along with it Satyayug has also begun. In this ocean of illusion a very great power has incarnated within us repeatedly. This is the picture of Virata and this is the Bhavsagara. The name of this power is Guru Sampada. Adi Guru Dattatreya has taken birth many times in this world. Adinath, in whom Jains believe, is His Incarnation. After that Dattatreyaji is also His incarnation. King Janaka is His incarnation.

Whom we call Nanaka and Nanaki are also Janaka and Janaki. And Mohammed Saheb was also His incarnation and His daughter Fatima was also Janaki. Her two sons were Luv and Kush. Later on, they are born many a times after coming to this world. First they were Luv and Kush. After Luv and Kush, they came into this world as Mahavira and Buddha. And later on they took birth as Hasan and Hussain, the two sons of Fatima. Whether this is true or not, you should test it again on Kundalini. Like, a Muslim doctor who lives in Iran, came to Me in London and said to Me That, "Mother, I have a really bad type of cancer and how do I cure it?" I said, "You are a Muslim and you will not have faith in any other Guru except Mohammed Saheb."

So he said, 'Yes.' I said, "Then I can't cure your cancer." Started saying, 'Why?' I said, "It is caused by imbalance - cancer is always caused by imbalance." This feeling is so strong and deeply embedded within you that Mohammed Saheb is the only Incarnation and can't there be other incarnations of Him? Although Mohammed Saheb has said a thousand times that, 'Many more like Me will come.' He has said this many times, but Muslims are not ready to accept that many like Him have come and will come. So he said, 'He has said so but I haven't seen anyone.' I said, "Well, if you chant the mantra of Dattatreya, I can cure you." At first that Muslim gentleman got very angry, he went away, annoyed with Me.

After that - but cancer is such a disease that what to do - he came back again running and said, "Okay Mother, I am ready to do whatever You say." Now his health is fine, because Dattatreya Himself cannot accept this that why are we dividing Him into so many divisions? Man wants to divide himself in this way. God does not want to divide Himself. Man wants that, 'I am a Muslim, I am a Hindu' - this is disgusting for God. It's weird to say, 'I am the nose, I am the eye, I am the ear.' - to talk stupidly like that. God has created man in the whole universe; Not to mould him into different shapes. There are many flowers blooming on the same tree. After taking those flowers and plucking them, after killing them you people are fighting amongst yourselves that, 'This religion is different, that religion is different.'

Just yesterday a gentleman had come from Delhi – let me tell you his story. He too is in a lot of problem; he is realized but he said, "This void of mine," what we call the void, Bhavasagar, "Is caught." I said, I asked him many things. I said, "Is this your problem, is that yours?" He said, "No," I said, "Are you a Jan Sanghi?" He said, "Yes, I am a great Jan Sanghi at heart." I said, "That is why it is happening - now sit down and do namaaz to Mohammad Saheb." "Become a Muslim for a while." He said, "Mataji, what are You saying?" I said, "Be and see.

Try being a Muslim for a few days," and soon after, [MARATHI] "Try becoming a Muslim and then you will see that you will be alright/fine." I said, "Okay, you take the name of Mohammed Saheb for a while." As soon as he took the name, vibrations started coming from within him. Vibrations start. If what I am saying is false, you can know it on vibrations. Your vibrations will immediately tell you what is truth and what is falsehood. You do not know the Absolute thing yet. Mother is saying this is true, he is saying that that is true, you check each and everything. It is evident before us. You people are just like computers; only your computer needs to be put into the mains now.

As soon as you are put to the mains, you will immediately know which thing is true and which thing is false. I told about some Gurus that, 'These Gurus are not good', then that gentleman got very angry. I said, "Okay, you get your realization, then see." After that, his condition is such that whenever anyone takes the name of that Guru, he says, 'Oh God, whose name have you taken?' They run away from there. One must recognize who is true and who is false. Should I not say who is truthful is truthful and who is false is false? If you read Kabir Das, in all his verses that he has written, he has said in all of them that these people wearing robes and those who instigate quarrels and these monks who take money and these fraudsters and those who are tantriks all these, he has lashed out at one and all and those who do khichari, everything, he has set everyone right, but who will read Kabir Das? I tell you that no one among the Hindi speaking people would have read Kabirdas. Manohar Kahaniyaan - Even if he is an M.A.

in Hindi, he will still keep reading Manohar Kahaniyaan [A MAGAZINE]. This is the disposition/inclination of man today. The disposition of the people of India has become very shallow. When you read Kabirdas, you get goosebumps. A single man, being at the level of a weaver, has lashed out at everyone in such a manner, what is called lashing. He has exposed every single person, those who show magic and witchcraft. Look at Nanak. Nanak has written chapters after chapters on these hypocrites. There are chapters after chapters written on those who make money, on those who show miracles. Why does one need to go anywhere; Read these people.

Marathi people must have read Tukaram a lot but nobody knows how much he has written on it. And even if they know, they will close their eyes and say 'This is our guru'. For Marathi people, Gurus gets stuck to them like stamps. Then you can't say anything about them. Who is your Guru? So, he is the Guru of that place. Well, what is his name? Now you have accepted him. "And even if he runs away with my wife, it doesn't matter - she has become my mother." And Gujaratis don't have time at all - they're all just collecting money.

Where is God? Shown some lamp, work's done, let's go. We have come to this state, this land of Yoga, in seriousness, to the country in which we have our living, where we live, how serious/solemn we should be there, how devoted should we be to God. Nobody thinks how deeply one should delve into it. Nobody has time for God. There is time to do all the works, but there is no time for God. And that is where all the joy lies, son. There is no joy anywhere else, let Me tell you the truth. You may search for anything. This very Guru Sampada was very powerful in our country, India.

There have been great teachers elsewhere too - no one can say that - Confucius is his incarnation. There are many great Gurus in other places too, but in our country it has been a great asset. There was Gyaneshwarji - there were so many great Gurus - there was Ramdas Swami. But their only influence on us was just singing songs. Take their hymns and keep singing from morning to evening 'Search your heart, brother', 'Search your heart, brother', 'Search your heart, brother'. Okay, they just gave a prescription to search for the pot(heart). You people just go on singing the same that, 'Search the pot only, search the pot(Heart) only' - but when will you search? People sing Kabir Das' Bhajans with great enthusiasm. He has sung that 'Song(Beats) of the heart can be heard on the silent top of our head'. The complete description of Kundalini is already given by him.

Meaning I'm not going to tell you anything new. He has sung and said everything 'Ida, Pingla, Sukhman Nadi re'. People will sit with a harmonium, play the tabla and sing loudly. 'Oh people, what are you singing?' 'Kabir Das.' What are you singing? What is written in it? Meaning this has also become a means of entertainment. Singers' group means, people are crazily engaged in it. Oh, what are you singing, what are you doing, what are you thinking - there is no integration/propriety in that.

That is why there is a need to know the Guru heritage of our country in depth. Now let me tell you about the Sikh people. In London, the Sikhs staged a huge opposition. They have done it because they have to tie those turbans on their head. Because if they are going by bike, motorbike somewhere and they happen to fall, their heads will crack. So one has to wear a helmet. So they said, 'It's forbidden in our religion.' 'Where is it written?' Ask them. Now the poor Englishmen have not read it.

They say, "Their religion is strange. When their heads will break, why can't they wear a helmet?" And raised this very serious/big question to the Parliament, to the Parliament. And one thing which has been absolutely and completely forbidden by Mohammad Sahab and Guru Nanak, that any kind of intoxication, of any type, alcohol, cigarette, any type of intoxication, is prohibited. They are number one among them - the British also have lost to them. If a Sardarji is coming from one side after consuming alcohol and an Englishman is coming from the other side, the Englishman will run away. 'As long as,' they say, 'the Sardarjis stay here, our Scotch whisky will never run out.' 'It's business will continue.' This is the name we people have earned there. And they're called Nanak's special people and they reached the Parliament that they don't want the helmet.

To this condition have they brought our Guru Sampada[heritage], the Great Power which God had incarnated within us. We have made it such that by creating different groups, and by making different things, and we are saying that, 'Yes, this only is our religion.' And what can be said about the amount of alcohol that Muslims drink! No one is more fond of alcohol than them; not only this, they have written poetry too. Many poets, one greater than the other, are praising this alcohol, this devil, so much. Definitely alcohol is a demon. Demons enter fermented alcohol. It turns a man into a demon. Maybe you people may not like this but I am telling you that alcohol within is a man-made atom bomb. Such a stupid thing it is!

I don't know how and when this came into their minds and they started making liquor and just now a gentleman came to tell Me that even the gods used to drink Somras. So I told them that's why they had a fall. And from where did they bring this scripture that the gods used to drink Somras. I said, "Were you there to see it?" But you don't drink. If you drink, you will become a devil and even after seeing those who drink, you start drinking again. There is no need to bring any prohibition policy for this. Think about this idea from your own mind. Think about it, how dirty it is! The biggest thing forbidden in Guru Sampada[Heritage] is intoxication.

Every Guru, who has come into this world, has strictly forbidden intoxication. Because this was not thought of in other incarnations, hence, those with Guru Sampada, did it. It was absolutely forbidden. And Christians will say that why did Jesus Christ not forbid it? He did, but a person named Moses of His time has clearly written that no intoxicating substance should be consumed because He was, He was a person of Guru Sampada[Heritage]. He has clarified this, but these great followers of Jesus Christ say, that, "We are great followers of Jesus Christ." Nobody in the world can insult Him as much as these people have. Because the one who has spent His whole life in celibacy, these are His disciples - just look at their faces. You have no idea in what pit these people are entrapped. These people call themselves disciples of Jesus Christ.

These people who insult Him are His worst enemies. We are like this only. We are no less. Whenever we think about religion, it is related to Guru Sampada. One thing has been told to us that every human being has the same light of the Spirit within him. Therein lies the vision/sight of God and every human being can be reborn. Then how can we say that a person is a Brahmin by caste only. And in that they say that it is written in the Gita. So you go and ask them this question, 'Who wrote the Gita?' 'Vyasa.'

'Whose son was Vyasa?' He was definitely the son of sage Parashar but his mother was from some lower caste - and that too illegitimate. Everyone knows. He was not the son of a Brahmin. His parents were not even married and their son born was Vyasa. Could he write that one should be a Brahmin by birth. This is an allegation. Who was Valmiki? You all know. Then chortle like this, 'A person can be a Brahmin by birth only,' is a very wrong thing.

People have made this dirty method of breaking all their paths. Brahmin means one who knows Brahma; 'Dwij', who has been born for the second time. He who has not been realised, cannot be a Brahmin. At our places, you can keep a Brahmin to cook food in your house. Done - Brahmin cooks food in the house 'We are holy people, we have kept a Brahmin in our house to cook food in the house.' Keep a Brahmin to perform the puja. A hired person cannot be a Brahmin. Brahmin is a condition, a tendency, One who is searching for Brahma. You are all Brahmins because you have come to Me searching for Brahma. One who seeks Brahma is a Brahmin, one who seeks power is a Kshatriya.

Thus, all this is based on one's disposition. But such dirty practices have been in vogue in India, how much have we troubled our teachers[Gurus]. Gyaneshwarji, because he was the son of a sanyasi - it's what these people said - took his life. Till recently, our Sai Nath of Shirdi, who was the incarnation of Dattatreya Himself, was persecuted because he was a Muslim. And now when He is dead, then before Him His enemies, the very people who tortured Him, are standing with their fat bellies and performing aarti to Him. Created means to make money. He has been enclosed from all sides - has been blunted. A day will come when His Spirit will leave that place. They have made a business out of Him. They have come out to sell God.

We are selling these Gurus. When they are alive, they torture Them and kill Them. Whatever, whatever can be, whatever evil and cruel of the world, all happens with Them. And when they're no more - when we die, then we know because we go into the collective subconscious - about which I'm going to tell you all tomorrow morning - When we go into the collective subconscious then we come to know, that we have done this evil deed, we have done this cruelty, and come back and start singing their bhajans[Hymns]. And if we can get some money along with it, is a very good thing. What is the state of religion we have made! This religious wealth is also within us in our Bhavsagara, therefore a person should have correct ideas about it. The greatest correct idea should be that religion is an innate thing inside us, something within us. And in every major religion and its founders, there is only one religious power. It has come in different forms, at different places and it is a continuous process.

Just as a tree first blossoms, then its buds come, then its leaves come, then its fruits come, seeds come, it comes in various forms, but the power within them is the same. Similarly in this tree of Dharma, in the great tree, which is the same thing, several things happened at numerous times and in diverse ways, but all are driven by the same power within. And we have no right to divide it or call it different and we become it's proclaimers. We say that we are so and so and we are so and so. Adi Shankaracharya's - just see, among all the Shankaracharyas today - except for one Shankaracharya, all the others Adishankaracharya, who had said, 'Neither yoga nor Sankhya' this is not going to happen through any means; Only by the Grace of the Mother can a man transcend[Be realized]. Shankaracharya has been tied up and thrown into the jungle. And all these people are roaming around with gold umbrellas on their heads. You know a gold umbrella is needed. Seen how their face looks inside? Shankaracharya means - such a big thing.

What comparison can there be between the Incarnation of Dattatreya Himself and these Bhadotris [Hired People] of today! Then comes its reaction. It should be understood that if you do not understand this power properly - it's reaction has come today itself that none of our young boys are being seen here. All are wasting time in college. Nobody is going to come here. They have nothing to do with religion. They think, "Our parents are stupid people, let them go, let them do what they have to do, it doesn't matter to us." They think, 'We are very intelligent.' They are also going in foolishness. They get away from one thing so are going into another.

But if you also want to establish religion, there must be awakening, there must be transcendence, but you must bring some balance in your thoughts. Balance has to be attained. And have to think that if we carry on with any extreme ideas, then it's not going to be beneficial in Sahaja Yoga. You have to be in the center. Any extreme person cannot benefit in Sahaja Yoga. If you are very close to that person and you don't want realisation, then we can't do anything. There are many people who say that, "Whether we get self-realization or not, we are still Jan Sanghis[Some Political group]," "And we will stick to them. We will kill wherever we find a Muslim." So they'll remain stuck. When they'll go before God, God will ask you, "Yes, what's the matter?"

They will say, "Oh, we were Jan Sanghis and we had a guru; we used to give him money." "Okay!" And he told us, "You do smuggling or whatever, give the money here. Hand me the purse." "So I used to give him money. Then I got caught while smuggling and now I am dead, and now I am in front of You." So God will say, "Now go to Hell." His Guru will also be sitting there and he will also sit there. Gurus will never say, "You don't do this, don't do that." No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

If he says this, then everything will be lost for him. Only a mother can say so, 'Son, don't do this.' 'This is prohibited, it is wrong.' Why should he say so? He is only interested in your purse, keep your purse here and sit comfortably. 'You consider me your Guru, right? Worship me and give me your purse.' Work done. They don't think what will happen after you die, after you meet God. They themselves have no idea what will happen to them.

Are they going to carry the burden of this money and all the things they have collected here? These people themselves will go and sit in the most dark Hell. There's no doubt in this that their utter destruction is also going to happen. But they will take you along with them and drown. You yourself know that they can't carry their bundles/burdens with them. If any person asks you for money in the name of God, then understand beforehand that God cannot be found here. It's another thing that suppose we have to build this Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan today - it's okay. Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan has no connection with God. This building needs to be built, collect money for it, make it, it's done. It can have no connection with God.

If someone says, 'Give for God.' What can you give for God? What do you have? What can you give? When everything is His, there is nothing worth giving Him. What can we give Him except our heart, our devotion to Him, there is nothing else to give. And those who - just today a gentleman was telling Me that, "Mataji, you should charge some fee." "You don't charge a single penny, that's why people don't value it at all." I said, "Wow, what to say about you!" I said, "Tell Me, for how much money would you sell your mother's love?

Put a price." "Today you've said such a thing, never say it again." No one can think of all these things because everything we think of in terms of money. There are some in something of Balaji, they apply some mark on their head - putting up a bid for that. There is a bid for moving the fan. Everything has become a share market. Are you people out to sell even your Mother's love. Just think how very disgusting the concepts of our religion have become. Think about it. Do we not know anything about love at all?

Did we not have mothers at all? Have we not seen love in this world? Have we become so stupid that we cannot understand this? All these thoughts were put before us by our Gurus and they told and taught us, how much the poor things suffered! The chakras above that, all those gurus are located within us. All those Gurus, all the Gurus, reside within us and guide us. If we have gone on the wrong path - I mean, in Sahaja Yoga I don't tell this to anyone I don't tell anyone that 'You should not drink alcohol, you should not smoke cigarettes.' When you get realized you give up yourself. 90% of the people leave on their own. There is no habit left.

The reason is that when you start enjoying yourself, then where do you have the time to enjoy anything else. You forget to be bored. The joy in your heart starts becoming so intense that you forget this thing altogether. That's why I don't tell anyone but it happens, automatically it happens. After that you'll see that the chakra above is called the heart chakra, in this heart chakra Jagdamba resides. You know Jagdamba Ji is Shiva, Shri Shiv's consort. Shri Shiv resides in the heart. Shiva resides in everyone's heart. The spark of the Spirit is inside our hearts, which is the reflection of God Almighty. Whether it is there or not, you see later on.

It is there. Inside this reflective form, the Spirit form is a light, like a flame, which stays in our heart and watches all our actions. It keeps watching us all the time, it does not get involved anywhere, it's just a witness, keeps watching. And the Kundalini which is kept in our triangular bone records everything. Whatever it sees, our whatever action the light of the Spirit knows, it watches It knows our every action - we can't hide anything from it. It's a witness, keeps watching. Like a reporter, and all it's light keeps falling on the Kundalini and the Kundalini keeps knowing. There is a triangle formed from the heart to here. Above the forehead is the seat of Shri Sadashiva. From there, the information goes to the Kundalini and just like a tape recorder, the Kundalini keeps noting down everything.

Many people, sometimes [when] I ask them something, they ask with great surprise, "Mataji, how do you know?" So I know about you from your Kundalini, I can play the whole tape. Just played your tape - finished/done. And whatever I want - don't even have to pull the tape - everything is revealed. Everything is stored in the Kundalini and this flame of the Spirit keeps burning alone, lonely. When the Kundalini is awakened, when the Kundalini rises and pierces the Bramharandhra, then The seat of Shri Sadashiva which is here above the head, remains forever above you all the time. Because of this you have the wisdom to discriminate between truth and falsehood. Conscience exists because of this. And then when it goes there and touches it - it's like a small light which keeps burning in the gas - and when the force of the gas comes and mixes with it, then the whole thing gets lit up. In the same way, the feeling comes into your entire consciousness, it's awareness comes.

The vibrations that come to your hands later on are the effects of that consciousness. And only after that does a man become a witness. This happening has to take place. This is not going to happen with any lecture. Even now when I am giving you a speech, My vibrations are still flowing and they are coming and the happening, whatever it is, is taking place within you. But it doesn't work out with all those people who give speeches and read books. For this, a highly authorised person is needed and the authorised person should be such who is completely united with God in love. Authorized means he should be someone spectacular who is sitting on the seventh floor everyone should bend and touch his feet. When the guru comes, one comes and puts his head on the guru's feet, then the other comes, he too puts his head on the feet. Put twenty five rupees there, someone put five hundred rupees there, and he with four feathers and two horns attached, is sitting there.

No. The one who is authorized is very simple. We believe Radhaji to be Adishakti, we believe in Sitaji too - what speciality did Sitaji have? We believe in Mary, the Mother of Christ, to be Adishakti - what was in Her? They were very ordinary Mothers, very ordinary, but strong/powerful from within. People had to be Realized to know Their powers otherwise people don't know it. In Sitaji's time, people were so sensitive, they were quite sensitive - today such a thing can't be seen. I had just been to Satara and I realised that the people of that sensitivity are here. Otherwise I have never seen such anywhere else who seemed to know exactly what the thing is. They were such sensitive people that they got realized in no time.

Their king's mother was so sensitive that I was very surprised. I said, 'In a small place like Satara - this might there due to the virtuous deeds of Shivaji - but people were so sensitive as if the lamps were fully ready and thus they lit instantly. Instantly - so very beautiful! When such people are there, this work gets done. There must be sensitivity for this thing, that a person is sensitive. Otherwise, I work hard and have done it. Now, among the upper Chakras, that I have told, the Chakra of Jagdamba, You know that Jagdamba ji many times after incarnating came to the Bhavasagara [ocean of existence] and has protected all Her devotees; you too are among them. Today in Kaliyuga, you are searching for the same. You too have come from among them. Without you having some assets, you would not have come and would not get realization.

If you know that this is your cheque which I am encashing, it's all your deposited wealth which I'm giving; nothing is mine I'm sitting in the center. As a mediator is, I'm sitting in the middle. It is yours, you take it, but it's only that I can't give you unauthorized. Will give it to whosoever is authorized and whatever I can do, how much I can put with the power of My love, I will. It happens, has happened to many, and has happened to thousands and should happen to you too. Now above that, the Chakra that is on it's side, you can say that it is the Chakra of Shri Ram and Sita because in evolution when He incarnated ten times, one of those incarnations was of Shri Ram and Sita. And Shri Ram was incarnated that it should be told to the world what an ideal king should be like. Now I cannot tell you much about this because time is short. And the chakra above it, which we call Agnya Chakra, is the optic thalamus. Where the nerves of our two eyes meet, there in the middle is a center through which both the pituitary and pineal glands are controlled, due to which the ego and superego which is formed in the head of a human being, is controlled and apart from this, this chakra, in it's center, now here, look here one is this Agnya Chakra, and here in the center is the Chakra of Shri Krishna.

This is Shri Krishna's Chakra, because this Chakra tells us that when man raised his neck, he set his eyes towards God. As long as his neck was towards the earth, till then his sight was not towards Virat or God Almighty. When he raised his neck, when he became a human from an animal, when he raised his neck, then here in the throat Shri Krishna resided. And Radhaji is the power of Shri Krishna. You know Ra-Dha, Ra means power, and Dha means the one who sustains. And because of this power, due to this power only, you become a witness. Now these are very deep matters; and now I'm just telling you the names of the Chakras and their presiding deities. What happens beyond that, what are its subtleties, what is its subtleness, what else is there in it, there is a lot to tell. We have some people who have attained mastery in this. You people should also try.

Nearly, if you, there are frequent programmes here in Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan. You people come, know/learn and understand; Some have written books too. I haven't written anything yet but everyone has written something, look at it. Listen to my lectures and understand them and use your hands, then you will know whether what I'm saying is correct or not. Now the above Agnya Chakra, which I had told, has the incarnation of MahaVishnu in it. If you read Devi Bhagavat, then you will know that MahaVishnu is a very big incarnation of the Son. And in that he has considered Shri Ganesha as the main principle. Considering Shri Ganesha as the main principle that incarnation was sent into the world, whose name is Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is none other but the incarnation of Shri Mahavishnu, whom we call Bauddha. He is the incarnation of Jesus Christ and His mother was Radhaji Herself.

It's evident that the name Jesus which they have given, this name Jesu, is from Yashoda. Yashoda's name is not mentioned anywhere so they have named Him Jesu and His name, which is Christ, is from none other than Krishna, because Krishna was His father. Repeatedly He describes His Father, you should read Devi Mahatma, in Devi Mahatma it is completely written about This Child. There is only a difference in the name. It says MahaVishnu and His name is Jesus Christ. If you read them, you will know exactly that these are His descriptions only. Fully it is His description that He came into the world and the things He did and the way He forgave; Forgiveness was His key principle. In forgiveness, whatever weapons there were He dissolved them and put them into forgiveness. He has given forgiveness as the greatest weapon that man has. Now the reality of this too, it's feeling, of everything, you can realize through Kundalini awakening that when the Kundalini rises and when it stops at any Chakra, then the name of that Deity has to be taken.

If you do not take it's name then the Kundalini will not rise. You can see this yourself. When the Kundalini rises, gradually you will notice that you will keep getting vibrations on the chakras. You can also see it with your eyes. There you will have to take the name of that very Deity which I am saying. If you do not take the name then the Kundalini will not rise and when the Kundalini rises you should know that the Deity there is happy. After that comes Sahasrara. Kalki is considered to be the incarnation of Sahasrara. Kalki means, the One who is the master of all the seven chakras, the master of all the seven chakras is Kalki. And hence Her incarnation is believed to be in Sahasrara and this is the highest incarnation of Adi Shakti. Because only due to this, because of Adi Shakti only, Sahasrara can be opened here.

Otherwise it could never be opened. Along side, all the Gods reside on this Chakra and this is the incarnation of Sahasrara. Now I have told you enough regarding this matter. We will now meditate a little and see what is our state.
