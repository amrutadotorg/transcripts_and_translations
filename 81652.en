 (England)
There were other people who lived in Chelsham Road before us. Actually, Grazyna last time explained that her wedding was there, and Linda Williams lived there with her little son at the time when we visited from Switzerland, long before we actually started to live there. And this was not planned at all, actually; it was one of these lilas. We were living in South London, and I was nine months pregnant with my twins. We were about to buy a little house in North London, and then it fell through. It just didn't happen.

People in Sahaja Yoga were really desperate to fill the ashram at Chelsham Road because Linda didn't get any rent, and this house was not looked after. As you know, it's a milestone of Sahaja Yoga in England. Shri Mataji gave it a lot of importance. She put the foundation stone herself in the garden at the entrance of the house, so it was an important building. However, the state of the house when we moved in was less than comfortable. How can I describe it? Well, I'll give you a little description. The wallpaper was peeling off the walls in many rooms. The carpets were torn apart, and under the carpet, to prevent humidity, they had put old newspapers. You can imagine, as a Swiss woman arriving there, I was horrified, although I knew it was an important place.

And I must say, to be fair, the meditation room was always magical. It was a place out of this world, I would say. It was like it could have been in India or in Italy, anywhere. It was a special place. The meditation room was very special. Actually, Shri Mataji had been there a lot of times before. Of course, it was smaller than it is now, and Chris Marlowe has done extensive reparation to this house, thank God.

So for me, I felt a bit like I was part of the dusty foundation and had to hold the building up. With me was this lovely Janet Ridley, who is a nurse—she's a matron now. And we were holding the fort together, of course, with our families. Our husbands were also living there, but I must say that the ones who were really working hard in the ashram were the ladies. And it was really Krita Yuga. In the two years we stayed there, there was not one minute where we were not doing something. It was relentless, either with the children or with puja. We'll explain a bit more.

With the discomfort, I need to also say one or two things because I think it was a little bit of a test for me, as I came from a very comfortable country. For instance, one winter when the babies were still very little, maybe six or seven months old, there was no heating in the bathroom. I had to organize a little bath in our bedroom for the babies—the two or the three of them—because you couldn't bathe babies in a cold bathroom in winter. That was not possible.

But the winter after they were born, which was 1989, there was a big freeze. At that point, the heating completely collapsed. We had icicles on the windows, which were not double-glazed. It was really freezing cold. I was a bit scared about hypothermia for the children, so I phoned Hesta and said, "Hesta, can we have some help? Because we have absolutely no heating, no radiators, nothing."

A lot of people, but nobody from London came over. It was amazing because Bogdan Shekovich at that time was at Shudy Camps, working as a doctor there in Cambridge. He came after his work at 11 o'clock at night with two big gas heaters for us to be able to survive, basically. That was a story I do remember. It was just incredible. Then Pat, Grazyna's husband, came, I think, after two days to properly repair the heating system, which was really quite old.

So this is for the comfort of the place with our families, our little children. I think it was a tapasaya to actually make things work because there was no place at that time for pujas or meditation. I mean, there might have been a place in St. Martin's Lane for meditation, but not a regular place like there are so many now in England. So we had pujas every Sunday, and we would cook a soup for all the people who would come. We had bhajans every Wednesday night, and I was cooking pasta for everyone who came, which was around 30 people at least, after I had put the babies to bed. Janet, bless her, was doing nights at the time on Wednesdays, so I also looked after her little son as well, and she would come back in the morning. I was kind of in charge of the bhajan session. I let them do the washing up, though. I didn't do that. So, yes, it was just very, very busy, very dynamic, and I think it was very good for Sahaja Yoga. Shri Mataji was very pleased that we were there.

Sometimes it was quite challenging. I remember I told a story that I will tell again because not many people were there the last time. There were little problems—I don't even remember what—in the ashram, and Shri Mataji called. She knows everything. She called and she said, "Antoinette, I would like to see you." I said, "Oh my God." I wasn't expecting that. I was trying to look nice, matching my tights to my skirt, and running towards the tube to get to Victoria. They were living in an apartment in Victoria at the time. I hurried to arrive at the required time, and a servant opened the door.

I was introduced into the living room of Shri Mataji, and I sat on the floor like I always did. I used to love sitting at her feet. She arrived in the room, and I bowed down to her. I felt so thirsty because I had really run to be there. The servant brought some tea, and the cup was there full of tea. I thought, "Oh my goodness, I would love to drink this tea now," but of course, I didn't say anything. I was waiting for Shri Mataji to have her tea. She read my thoughts and she said, "Have your tea." I said, "Thank you, Shri Mataji." My throat was dry because I was so thirsty. So I had my cup of tea. Then she smiled at me and she said, "Antoinette, you don't need to match your tights to your skirt."

We laughed together. We really laughed because I knew she knew everything and she was going to sort out everything. And she said this beautiful sentence that I always remember, and I think I've said it to many people because it's so helpful to know. She said, "When there's a problem somewhere or a difficult situation, I let it develop and grow until it reaches a climax. The wave of the ocean, I come down, crash onto the shore. I come forcefully with my vibrations." I have always kept this image, which is so beautiful, of this big wave. With Shri Mataji's attention, when there is a difficult situation, she comes forcefully with her vibrations. For me, I kept that throughout the whole time in Chelsham Road and also afterwards in my life.

I had so many different instances of Shri Mataji reading our thoughts. I don't want to go too much outside Chelsham Road, but I had several instances where she was reading my thoughts. Just a small example in Switzerland, I was driving her in a car to a program. There were bells ringing in a church and people getting into the church. And I thought to myself, "Oh, that's really funny. They all go to church because they think God is in the church, and actually God is sitting next to me." At that point, Shri Mataji turned her head towards me and smiled and just blew a kiss. She had read my thoughts. It was so nice.

It was creative times as well. I had a little treat when I was there. After a while, my friend Brigitte Nico was in Columbia at the time, organizing programs for Shri Mataji to come. As a treat, I was sent there to help with the preparation. And bless Janet Ridley, her mom was a nurse and knew how to look after small babies. They took the three of them to her place somewhere in England, I think it was in Derbyshire, and they looked after these babies for over a week for me so that I could have a break. Can you imagine? It was just wonderful. It was like a little treat.

Apart from the puja and the bhajans, there was also quite a lot of creativity at Chelsham Road. We had quite a few meetings. We were receiving people in the kitchen and the rooms were busy. We didn't have a living room apart from the meditation room, but we also did something, Janet and I. We had started the year before doing a little play for Shri Mataji with children. That's how the plays started. The first was "The River Thames," which was presented at Shudy Camps, with all the children dancing with nursery rhymes where we changed the words. The second play was about Shri Hanumana for a puja in Moorgate. We did the whole play, and it was very nice because other yogis helped with the beautiful costume for Hanuman and for the little girls dancing. We choreographed the dance for the girls, we did songs, and I must say, Shri Mataji was very delighted by that. I remember watching her from the stage when we were organizing the children, and she had a real smile. She was very pleased.

From there, we went to Shudy Camps to present the babies to Shri Mataji. Shri Mataji named them at Shudy Camps when we were at Chelsham Road. She named the twins because the other one, Mahadevi, had already got her name a year before. She named them Bhakti and Shakti. I remember very well. We were in Shudy Camps. I don't remember which puja, but it was in the summer. She held them both in her arms, one after the other, and asked for their names. She gave small names so that we could actually call them together: Bhakti Shakti. It's easy to call these little children. Marilyn actually remembers that very well too. It was lovely, one child after another in her arms and naming them. And they are really, one is really Shakti and the other one is really Bhakti. They have the qualities. One has the quality of Shakti power, the other one is really Bhakti. It's very nice.

So that's what I have to say about Chelsham Road. That's what I remember. These stories are just in my memory. I didn't have time to write them in my diary because, you can imagine, I didn't have time to write diaries at that time. It was really Krita Yuga, very, very busy work.

Maureen: But nevertheless, you remember them very vividly. And it's lovely to hear these stories. I really don't envy you going into Chelsham Road with all the wallpaper falling off.

Antoinette: I have to say that Chris Marlowe did a wonderful job. Before we arrived, we bought some wallpaper and we bought new woolen carpets for all the upstairs rooms. All the rooms were re-wallpapered. I also made some curtains because there were hardly any curtains. So I made some curtains for all our bedrooms.

Maureen: Very nice. Thank you for reminding me of that.

Antoinette: Chris Marlowe was doing that completely with benevolence, completely willingly. He didn't ask for any money. And he's the one that Shri Mataji asked to buy the house. And now, of course, Chelsham Road belongs to him and it's a Yuva Shakti ashram, and he's doing really well. He also extended the place very much. He repaired the kitchen, he did two more bathrooms on the top floor, and he extended the roof to make a beautiful bedroom at the top. So he did a lot of work there and consolidated the roof. It's a livable place. Actually, one Yuva Shakti said once to me, "You know, Antoinette, I know you were there all the time. And sometimes when I find it difficult to climb all the stairs with my little boy, I remember if Antoinette could do it with three babies, I can do it with one."

Maureen: Super. And those babies were in Mother's arms at Shudy Camps and given their names, which is very, very sweet. And of course, that leads us on to hearing from Grazyna about Shudy Camps and her experiences there. So thank you very much, Antoinette. It's always lovely to hear all your stories, and no doubt there are plenty more for another time.

Antoinette: You're very welcome, Maureen.

Maureen: Very sweet. So Grazyna, can you take over from there? Shudy Camps, when were you there? What did you do? What happened?

Grazyna: Well, I prepared a little presentation. The first part of the presentation is the history of Shudy Camps. It was bought by Shri Mataji. The second part is a short video of the inauguration of Shudy Camps. This is a very important video, it's only 10 minutes, where Shri Mataji is actually expressing her joy and she's so pleased. It's just a wonderful video. She talks about Shudy Camps and the history a little bit as well. The next part, I'm going to talk about our stay in Shudy Camps. Then there will be photographs, and Derek can comment on the photographs and take over. I will try to be very short so he has plenty of time.

(Technical discussion about photo sharing removed)

I will just start now about the history of Shudy Camps because it's an old building. Shudy Camps, the house is actually called Shudy Camps Park House, and it's a Grade II listed building. It was fundamentally from the 17th century. Later on, in the 18th and 19th centuries, there were some additions to the building. It was built by Marmaduke Dyrell in about 1700 and remained with the family for three generations, so it's quite a long time. It was sold in 1898 to a person called Arthur Gee who, four years later, died. Then the house was sold to a vicar of Shudy Camps who was also a meritorious vicar of Ely Cathedral. In 1949, on his death, it was requisitioned by the British Army and the house was occupied by the Royal Air Force until Shri Mataji bought the house in the summer of 1986.

The house belonged to Shri Mataji for about ten years. It was sold later on, after Shri Mataji bought Cabella. It was beautifully renovated. When you see the photographs, you will see what a difference it made, the yogis' work on the house and how beautifully it looked after the renovation, because it was really in a quite dilapidated state.

The main building belonged to Sahaja Yogis and the adjacent building belonged to a man called Mr. Peace. And this Mr. Peace became Mr. War, because he was driven mad by the building work going on right into the night and then also in the early hours of the morning. Some visiting yogis, who were not aware that we didn't have the whole property to ourselves, were shoe-beating on his doorstep at four o'clock in the morning. But somehow he still survived all these years; something must have kept him wanting to stay there. So, if you can have the video now, it just brings everything back to us.

(Video Transcript: Shri Mataji speaks at the inauguration of Shudy Camps)

It's so very joyous to see you all here assembled together. I have to thank you very much for getting such a nice place as this Shudy Camp. I have given it a new name, Shuddikamp, meaning "cleansing camp," which is such an ancient building. It has gone through various stages of history and has kept the mark of all these times. And now you have to build up the future on this land, on this spot, in this building.
Also I am thankful to you for buying such a nice comfortable car for me. I thought I was supposed to buy it, but everybody said, "No, we are supposed to buy it for you, Mother." This is the first house that is in My name. The first house I owned. And this is the first car I have owned in My name. I am so proud that My children have bought it for Me. With their love and affection, they have bought this huge, big place, as well as the car, for My dwelling, as well as for My comfort.
When we come on this earth, when the incarnations descend, they don't need a dwelling at all. They have a dwelling that's roof is the sky, and the clouds are the curtains, and grass is their bed, and all the directions are the walls. But when they reside in the heart of their children, in the heart of their bhaktas, the heart of their devotees, then these beautiful hearts create something so artistic, reflecting the joy of their own creation. Like an artist who sees the beautiful creation of God Almighty and feels the joy of that creation within himself, and then recreates it according to his own expression of love. This is what you have done by buying this house and by buying this car for Me.
I don't need any conveyance, you know that. But in the modern times, the conveyance has changed. It started with a little mouse, changing into a car, maybe an airplane. But actually, My conveyance is your heart. Only through your heart I can be carried. There's no other way out. Your sincerity, your devotion, your love, can only carry your Mother. And this is a symbol of that. Matter has only one facility: that you can express your heart through these material things. Your nobility, your graciousness, your generosity is expressed through matter. I do that Myself. And now you have done it this time. I am thankful to you.
As you know very well, that I cannot be contained into anything. Neither in this house, neither in England, nor in India, nor in the whole universe. I am rather too large. But of course in your heart I can be. And that is how your heart should be for Me, a comfortable place, like a lotus, to relax, to realize My own love.
When all these things happen, so much adoration is poured on your Mother, you just get boundless. You spread out. You reach such spots in the whole of humanity. Everywhere I can feel the worship, the enjoyment of millions and millions who died before, who are there, and who will be there. All this expands you into a very subtle sensibility of feeling every suffering soul, every tortured person, every unhappy being.

Grazyna: It's just such an amazing video. It makes me cry, really. So, you see, Mother was very, very pleased. It was the first house, as she said, that she actually owned herself. She was very pleased with the car that the yogis bought as well, the white Mercedes that she had. It was really very nice.

I just want to say something about our coming to Shudy Camps, how it all happened. After Shri Mataji bought it in the summer, we went there. We didn't know how long we were going to stay; we just assumed we were going to live there for as long as required. Pat went there to do some plumbing, but so many things needed fixing. As you will see from the photos, a lot of work went into fixing things because the place was really just like Chelsham Road. It looked even different than what you saw after you went to live there.

Luckily, we had a functional kitchen. There was only one bathroom, imagine, in this huge place. One bathroom that was propped up with very little support, just hanging in mid-air. We left our London house, believing we were just going to be living there. When we arrived, we wished we had gone there before we actually moved, because there was nowhere for us to be as a family. The men went to one room, the ladies went to another. We had to leave our little son with my stepson in our house in London, and there were yogis also living there, so they were looking after him. My stepson was doing A-levels at the time. It was very normal for Sahaja Yogis to suddenly move somewhere and go do something else. My husband was working for a plumbing company, so he left his job and went to do plumbing in Shudy Camps. We were so happy to do this. We regarded it as the greatest privilege we could have.

The whole Shudy Camps experience was very highly charged with the feeling of building the foundations of Sahaja Yoga in the heart of the universe. It was just an amazing thing, and we were very keen to be good yogis. We used to get up at four o'clock every day, meditate, and work, quite often 12 hours a day, seven days a week, no weekends, with short breaks for food and a short siesta. Mind you, we were all comparatively young, so it was not a big deal for us to do all these things.

The men worked very hard physically. I remember John Watkinson, Ferdi, Arnaldo from Italy—this huge man, sorry, everything that was heavy. You will see him in the photograph. There was Barry Humphrey, Erwin from Spain, whom I used to call "Little Tim," and Laurent, who was doing carpentry. There was Harry Bamra, who now lives in Austria. He had just gotten his realization, and he came to Shudy Camps to work. He still had very long hair. He was a Sikh and he had given up his turban, but he was wondering when to cut his hair because his mom didn't want it cut. Anyway, he was very enthusiastic, very young, and very good with his hands.

There were many people coming and going. Yogis from overseas, especially from France, Italy, and as far as Australia, came to help. It was an international project, not only an English project. Barry West was coming very often from Cambridge to do electrics, and English yogis would come for the weekends. Sometimes there were so many people staying overnight that it was quite a challenge for the few ladies cooking to provide all the meals and feed everyone. And then the Italians came to stay and work. Shri Mataji put a young Indian girl named Nita in charge of the kitchen because we were supposed to eat only Indian food. The Italians were saying, "Thank you very much, we are not hungry." But we found out later that they were actually having midnight feasts with pasta. That's probably why they weren't hungry in the morning for breakfast. It was quite funny sometimes. It was so wonderful to have such an international collective coming to work.

At one point, we brought our son, Anand, back from London because my stepson was doing his studies, and we didn't expect the yogis to look after him for such a long time. He came to stay with us, sleeping in the dormitory with the ladies. But it was very challenging because I was in the kitchen all day. There was a lake at the back of the house with no fence. Then there was work on the roof, and things were falling down all the time. At one point, when a huge wheelbarrow of rubble fell next to him, we all decided it was time for him to find another place. Shri Mataji sent him to the school in Rome, and I was very glad because I was always worried about him.

Now, I would like to say something about the roof. The biggest job—the roof was very huge, and it was in very bad condition. It had to be changed. I just want to read to you an extract from Pat's book, because Pat is not here to share anything, but I can share something that he has written.

(Excerpt from Pat's book)

To be involved in Sahaja Yoga was to go through a process of change in outward collective activity, as well as inward experience. One day, Shri Mataji told us that the time had come for us to establish permanent centers and ashrams. The first of a series of major collective Sahaj building projects kicked off when we bought a large house in Cambridge. Those who could afford contributed money and those who could not volunteer work, and some, of course, contributed both.
I spent a great deal of time there, and while we worked hard, we had a lot of fun as well. It was the first time I had been in the countryside for quite a while, and I really enjoyed it. We had not been there long when we discovered that the roof and the top floor were riddled with wood rot, and that the weight of the roof was starting to push out the big wooden beams lining the top of the outside walls on which it rested. We needed to dismantle the entire roof—a large structure with two wings and numerous dormer windows—and rebuild it from scratch. We attacked it without a second thought. We had two or three carpenters, but it was going to take a lot more than that to get the job done. A couple of experienced builders were discovered among Sahaja Yogis in Australia and flown over to take charge of a large number of keen apprentices.
A practice would have been to construct a huge scaffold roof while the work went on, but we could not afford this, and Shri Mataji told us that she would hold back the rain as long as we worked as fast as we could. We worked flat out seven days a week for about six weeks. Towards the end, even the village postman was asking us to hurry up because the local gardens needed some rain. He really believed it. He was saying, "I can't believe it, not even a drop of rain." It was autumn.
It was a brilliant experience. We had large sections of the top of the building off at various points, and standing on the top floor was a bit like being on the deck of an aircraft carrier, surrounded by miles of beautiful countryside. At night, I'd look at the Milky Way, which was wonderfully clear away from the light pollution of London.

Grazyna: In December, we were still working away. It was quite cold there, the heating wasn't working, just like Antoinette experienced. I was thinking, "How am I to survive the winter?" But Shri Mataji invited us on the India tour. I went on the tour and also attended my stepson's wedding. So it worked out perfectly. He got married during that tour. I went back to Shudy Camps afterwards and stayed until March 1987, by which time Pat found himself going to another project: the ground floor of Pratisthan was going to be built.

The work on the house continued. Many yogis contributed, coming and going and living there. Many new people got established as well because it was a big collective ashram, like Cabella. Of course, we had children's camps in Shudy Camps. And I must tell you, Antoinette, the first camp was for one week, and we did a play. It actually started with a play written by yoginis and the children. They rehearsed for the whole week, built the props themselves, made the costumes themselves. We had puja, we had havanas, we had lots of things during that first children's camp, and there were many more to follow. We also had the first Yuva Shakti seminar in Shudy Camps. Sadly, the clinic that Shri Mataji wanted to establish never really took off properly.

Shri Mataji's husband retired, so there was no need for him to live in the UK. Shri Mataji decided that the warm climate of Italy would be more agreeable for the family and for her work to continue in Europe from Italy. So, Shri Mataji bought Cabella in 1990. So now, photos, and over to Derek.

Derek: The first photo was the front of the house, from the land we had in front. The staircase going up to the first-floor landing was ripped out, and a concrete one was put in, which you'll see in later photos. That's outside. We re-plastered all the walls and ceilings there. I remember the first delivery was 300 plasterboards. This is a gazebo, which was put up in the garden for one of the pujas when Baba Mama's group came over. That's everyone mucking in at the front of the house. We had 50 Austrians come over to help out. Those are the peacocks, which used to go and peck the car hubs when they saw their reflections. Percy.

When the roof was stripped off, all the wood was placed outside, and someone came along and said, "I can take it away for you." We said we'd let him know. We discovered it was hundreds-of-years-old oak, so we sold that wood, which helped pay for the roof. It was very valuable. The previous owners had had a big fire and covered up all the damage with sheets of plasterboard. It wasn't revealed until we had a quick look.

We remodeled the main columns in the main room. That's the main room before it was done up. We had lots of ladies stripping paint and putting up all the cornice work. John Watkinson was making it in the shed outside. That's Finn Barr. Arnaldo and Gareth from Derby. These are before and after photos. This is coming up from the first-floor landing, just outside Shri Mataji's bedroom. Some of the doors we took and had them dipped. Arnaldo helped me with the plastering; he was a very good decorator as well. That's the kitchen extension which was there when we arrived. All new doors and windows. That's Paddy, that's Dawn, and Marilyn. Dr. Bogdan and his wife. That's Harry.

A few days before Shri Mataji's arrival, there was no staircase; we'd ripped it out. They poured the concrete, and the day before, some Sahaja Yogis turned up from Italy. We asked, "Do you do tiling?" They said, "Yes." And we said, "That's your job." So they started laying the tiles on the concrete staircase. It was all touch and go. That's the finished staircase. While they were doing the aarti outside, I had to mix up plaster of Paris and go up the staircase filling in the gaps in the wall, and when I finished, somebody was coming up behind me with a paintbrush.

The Sahaja Yogi on the right was an Austrian policeman. He didn't feel vibrations, but when we went to Cabella afterwards, he got worked on and then he could feel them. But in Shudy Camps, he couldn't feel anything.

Maureen: Derek, did you also have a particular anecdote that you wanted to tell?

Derek: Yes. I was asked to come to Shudy Camps to work. Shri Mataji said, "Do you want to move in?" and I said, "Yes." I was living in Birmingham, so I assumed it was going to be a big job. She said, "I have some work for you." So I came down and moved into Shudy Camps. There were people there already, but I knew that she wanted me to do the plastering, and every wall and ceiling had to be done. It was quite a big job, and I wouldn't be able to manage it on my own if she wanted it done quickly.

One day I was thinking, "I need some help." All of a sudden—we didn't have mobile phones in those days—there was a phone call from Antonio saying, "Shri Mataji is on her way. She's going to be there within the hour." I was thinking, "Oh no, she's read my mind." I ran around telling everyone Shri Mataji was coming. At the time, it was a gravel driveway and there was a whole load of rubble piled up outside a first-floor window. Shri Mataji's car arrived, she came out, they did the aarti, and then I heard her say, "Where's Fergie?"

So I walked over and she said, "What's happening with the work?" Everyone was looking at me, thinking, "Don't say anything," but I thought, "I can't not say anything." She said to me, "What do you need?" I said, "Well, we need two more plasterers. We need a carpenter for the windows. We need a plumber." There was Pat, but he didn't know how to do heating engineering, how to provide heating in all the rooms. She said to me, "Well, just get them." She said, "Just put an advert in the paper." She asked if I knew any other plasterers, and I said I'd left London and didn't really know anybody. So she said, "Put an advert in the paper."

After Shri Mataji asked what we needed, we got what we needed. We didn't even have tools. We had to have a whip-round of the whole collective, asking, "If you've got any spare tools..." because the money was only for Shri Mataji's work. But we needed hammers, we needed lots of things. Lots of tools were donated. The place was freezing. I remember the local leader, Jim, went and bought some Calor gas heaters, which saved the day. You could see your breath.

For six weeks, we worked constantly. Then, two weeks before the inauguration, we had a 24-hour shift. As you went to sleep, someone else would take your space. We were working around the clock. And the story with Mr. Peace... I remember he called the police a few times. Luckily, I was there when the police arrived. They said, "We've had a few complaints about some noise." I had to say, "Everyone be quiet now!" I said to the police, "Look, don't worry, I'll sort it out." And we managed to keep going. One time, Mr. Peace came into the kitchen, and I had to pacify him and say, "Look, we're trying to finish it quickly." And he was all right. In the end, everything worked out.

On the day of her arrival, it was just last minute. The Italian Sahaja Yogis had just put the tiles on the staircase. As Shri Mataji was coming in, she walked up the staircase. I remember rushing off, taking off my overalls, throwing them down, and just holding my hands out. Unfortunately, the Sahaja Yogis who were doing the plumbing on CP's shower weren't so lucky. They were there, around the corner, trying to fix things while water was pouring out because the facilities weren't connected. That was quite funny.

Before that, when Shri Mataji did arrive, she did say to me—I don't know if people know this—that she actually wanted Shudy Camps to be in Scotland. She said, "Lord Shiva's in Scotland, and if we had had Shudy Camps in Scotland, the vibrations would be coming down to England from Scotland." But she said a few people didn't want to go north of England, so she said, "Okay, Cambridge is a little way." I think it's about 50 miles outside London. So at least that was helping the country.

It was an excuse for us to get on. Different nationalities came, and the main thing was for us to get together and share things between us. After that, she actually asked me, like Pat, to go to Pratisthan. I went there, and then after that, Cabella. I moved into Chelsham Road in 1981 and stayed there for months and months while the work was going on there. It was just an excuse for us to spread vibrations among ourselves and just enjoy each other's company.

The story about what was happening was that a lot of people could not come to England for pujas. Having the pujas in Italy was a good reason because lots of people from Russia and Eastern Europe couldn't get visas for England. When you're in Europe, you can just drive around. So her going to Italy would enable more collective people to meet up. We had one puja where we hired a plane amongst ourselves and 180 of us traveled to Italy. There's a talk where she explains that the spirit had to go to the soul. Most people know that talk. So there are lots of connections there.

Maureen: Wow. Golly, what an evening we've had. It's lovely.
