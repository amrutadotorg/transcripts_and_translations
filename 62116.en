Interviewer: Could you tell about you a bit ?

Shri Mataji: Myself?

Interviewer: Yes yourself.

Shri Mataji: What should I tell you. I was born in India, and I knew from my childhood that I have to do this work of giving self-realization to people, Its, we were born in a Royal family, ours is a Royal family.

Interviewer: Royal family.

Shri Mataji:  Ya, and they have a calendar, but now it’s long time back they were there, and my father also was a great soul, he was a master of 14 languages he translated ‘Quaran e Sherif’ in Indian languages. [UNCLEAR]

My mother was Honors of Mathematics, but my whole idea was to find out the way and method by which I could give ‘A Mass realization’, normally they take 1 disciple work hard on that disciple and mostly it works then it alright, otherwise it’s alright we can’t work it out.

In our county this knowledge was known to us for thousands of years, but only I always say poetically that ‘there were few flowers of the tree of life so they couldn’t become fruits but today I think it’s blossom time.

And in 1970 , 5th May I discovered a method by which I could do that ‘A Mass Realization’ , it’s a happening, actually it’s an actualization and the happening that takes place, you can see in so many people when there is obstruction this power that is in triangular bone is pulsating you can see it with naked eyes and you can also see the rising up power in some people but those who are quite normal it just shoots off but otherwise if there is any obstruction you can see it , it’s there, this power in the triangular bone called as sacrum , that means sacrum is the word comes from the Greeks , so the Greeks knew about it that’s why they called it sacred.

SACRUM .

Interviewer: How do you see it?

Shri Mataji : You see , in the people as I said if there is obstruction in its rising then you can see it moving like a little movement of a wave  you see, but it is like you can say A  seed you plant in the Mother Earth it sprouts by itself, in  the same way this is the thing is like a primule like the primule germinating , just it comes out by itself.

Interviewer: How do you get it moved, to move

Shri Mataji: You see it’s so spontaneous, spontaneous, it is built in you, and it is built in me, Alright, it’s like the Mother Earth, is built in with that power and the seed has got built in it. When you put the seed in Mother Earth it sprouts in the same way.

Interviewer: Maybe you cannot show the method.

Shri Mataji: No No no methods you see, it is just if they put hands like this

You see it works, just putting in hands like this, it works she might have got it [UNCLEAR] on her head.

You feel a cool breeze in the head.

Yogi: cool breeze coming from her head.

Shri Mataji: Just now see, take out the pencil from her hand, just put like this.

Her eyes are dilated, all right, she has got it. Are you feeling it, Are you feeling?

Interviewer: Yah yah.

Shri Mataji: Aah. because I could see your eyes, the pupil dilated, but now you see.

Yogini: Shining, sparking Mother all the time.

Interviewer: What’s this?

Shri Mataji: Like you become the spirit, and it is so joyous, it’s so joy giving.

Interviewer: And then what happens?

Shri Mataji: Now with this you become a collective being, now you can feel others these are all the centers, centers within us, you can feel the center of another person, you can cure others, you can give them realization, everything you can do. Subtle center energy.

Mechanically it can be explained also.

Yogini: She Is surprised.

Shri Mataji: That’s turkeys, that’s Turkish character, you don’t have to work very hard, they just get it like that.

Interviewer: I am afraid.

Shri Mataji: No nothing to be afraid, you have become something great now.

Interviewer :1st time. 

Shri Mataji: Ya, just like that, that means you are great, you are gem.

Interviewer: I am happy.

Shri Mataji: Yes you good, very good and not only but you get the power now to cure other people , you can raise their Kundalini , this power is called as kundalini , you can give realization , you can feel it yourself and you can know what’s wrong with them  because the Spirit is the collective being within you , it’s the collective being , so you become collectively conscious , your human awareness gets a new dimension.

Is it in Turkish language?

Sympathetic and Parasympathetic. And you feel absolutely relaxed, that’s the point, I can have some milk, it’s rather calm.

Interviewer: Great. With this Kundalini, are you capable of moving things?

Shri Mataji: Not that’s not important, that’s not a very good thing, also things are moved by another method, what you call as ‘pret vidya’ that comes from cemetery, from the dead, that’s not a good thing.

Interviewer: Why do they call you Nirmala Devi.

Shri Mataji: Nirmala, my name is Nirmala, Immaculata, Devi is called to any women in India it’s called Nirmala Devi.

Interviewer: Nirmala.

Shri Mataji: Devi.

Interviewer: It means pure.

Shri Mataji: Yes, Nirmala means pure, immaculate, Devi they put to any one like that to give just give respect .

Interviewer: What is your aim in this Sahaja Yoga.

Shri Mataji: Just to give joy to everyone , their own joy, see you have got within yourself this joy in a dormant state , just to expose you to that, that’s all, and you can’t pay for it , there is no obligation, nothing .One candle which is enlightened can enlighten another candle, then we realize that we are all one , part and parcel of the whole and such a transformation takes place that you become a peaceful person within, no agitation, no aggression and with that this transformation the whole humanity can change.

Now we are working in 36 nations, and in Russia we are very successful, Russia. So, this is what has to happen to us.

Interviewer: What would you tell to unhappy people to get happy, I can’t say these days I am unhappy, what should I do?

Shri Mataji: The source of happiness is your Spirit; nobody can give you happiness, joy, it only comes from your Spirit. When your spirit comes to your attention, you become so joyous, and you want to share this joy with others.
