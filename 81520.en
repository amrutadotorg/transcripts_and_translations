It was a long time ago, so my memory is probably... I came in March 1978. A friend of mine, Charlie, who was also a Sikh, had been to India and had been everywhere seeking. He said he went to Caxton Hall, and a lady there showed him a small black and white photograph that had vibrations. They invited us to go to Finchley on Sunday to meet her. I said, "Yeah, I'm coming." I didn't have any gurus, but I had read lots of books about India and meditation, and I was into vegetarianism, yoga, and all sorts.

So we went there. We walked into a room that was maybe a bit smaller than this, and there were about 15 people in there. They all had a red mark on their foreheads because it was after Easter Puja. We didn't know what it was, but it didn't upset me. In fact, I quite liked it. I thought somebody knew what they were doing.

And Shri Mataji... I thought, "I know her. I've seen her before somewhere." She was very familiar to me. So I sat in front of her. They were working on me, and they said my vibrations were cool, but I didn't feel anything, really.

When I went home, I was living in Maida Vale, just on the edge of Regent's Park. I had a shower, and when I was done... I was alone in the flat; the people I was sharing with were away. Suddenly, I couldn't think at all. I tried to think, and I couldn't. I used to do Hatha Yoga, so I knew I had to lie down. I lay down on the floor, and I was aware of energy coming into my void. It went to the heart, it went everywhere, and it went like a crown on my head. I was really in bliss.

So I realized that this happened because I met this lady today. She's really special. That's how I came to Sahaja Yoga.
