[Missing] ... has to be taken up. Otherwise, I tell you, some of you may start looking like Aurangzeb or Jangis Khan or Hitler or something like that, you see, all these! And suddenly, I find thing among Sahaja Yogis, some Hitler standing with a moustache and a hair like that, with the nose like that. Suddenly, I find someone like that. It's quite possible. I mean what I have seen of Sahaja Yoga, at the West, I'm surprised, you see. You leave somebody as a little sparrow and when you come back you find a hawk. "Is that the same person?" "Yes, now she's become a hawk". Oh, wow! Only possible in the West, I can tell you. If you tell somebody in India, they will not believe.

Like Mr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, only possible in the West. When I read this story I said, "How can it be possible?" Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, I said, "How can it be possible?" But I've seen it. It happens here. When they are good, they are very, very good. And when they are bad, they are horrid. But that's only in the West, you don't find this in India, why? The reason is we are deep into ourselves, very deep.

All right, you have not missed anything now, because you got your Realization as they have got it. You’ve got the knowledge of Sahaja Yoga as they have got it. But test it upon yourself. And humble down yourself, go down into yourself, facing yourself, just telling yourself, "No, I have to be deeper and deeper, I'm not going to listen to anything. Ego and all that nonsense, I'm not going to listen, I'm going to go deeper and deeper". And move into yourself, embed yourself into reality, piercing through all these ego and nonsensical ideas that come from you. Then only you can correct it, otherwise you cannot.

The best way in meditation I've seen to improve your ego is to meditate on my feet.

My feet have that magic. Have you got photographs of my feet?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: I don't find anything here.
Sahaja Yogi: No. We have lots.
Another Sahaja Yogi: In pujas, we have.
Shri Mataji: You have. You just bring one, just bring one.
All right, wash them. They are very small.
Sahaja Yogi: We have large ones.
Shri Mataji: Not this one, not this one.
Sahaja Yogini: This is, this is;
Shri Mataji: Not this kind, another one, straight.
Sahaja Yogi: He is going to get.
Shri Mataji: Ah, see?

Vibrations [unclear]. [Hindi conversation]

Ah, that's it! They are reflecting too much though the light, ‘ne’? Can we take out this?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Please, take it down.

Get lots of these, all kinds, they have.
Sahaja Yogi: [Unclear] change.

Shri Mataji: Lighter?
Now the second group can come in. Are you all right now? Better?
Sahaja Yogi: Still there.
Shri Mataji: Still there?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Beat yourself with shoes, I tell you, beat yourself with shoes. That's the best way, go and beat yourself with shoes, all of you.
Sahaja Yogi: All the people outside, come in.
Shri Mataji: Now those, come in, just. [Hindi conversation]
Very simple, feet.
Sahaja Yogi: All the people at the back come right in.

Shri Mataji: Get some puja ones also. You haven’t got? Yes?
Sahaja Yogi: We have two, three sets.

Shri Mataji: No need to rub my feet, you can just wash them.

Can you feel the vibrations going?

Now let's have the second group come down now.

Sahaja Yogi: People who bow at your being, please move this way.
Shri Mataji: Have you got Kumkum here?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: Bring it. Those who have not rubbed my feet can rub with the Kumkum, it will be a good idea. Those who have not rubbed my feet, so far, should wait. And others can meditate a little bit on the feet.
Sahaja Yogi: Those who have not been forward come forward.

Shri Mataji: Come this side.

[Hindi conversation]

Can you feel the vibrations now, the cool breeze? Put it in a Katori, or something. Put it in a-
Sahaja Yogi: Mixer?
Shri Mataji: Hum. Now. All right? Good?

Christine, how are you? Better? Good. Now those who want to come further, come along. Now some others to come further.

[Hindi conversation]

Now just watch.

Are you better now?
[Hindi conversation]

Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataj, more water?
Shri Mataji: No, no need. Just dry.

Did you use the ice?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: It helped you?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, it did.
Shri Mataji: It's right sided problem. Stomach, how you did it? On the liver?
Sahaja Yogi: On the liver.
Shri Mataji: That also helps, release. Now your breathing is all right.
Sahaja Yogi: It’s better.
Shri Mataji: Regina, you sit here. Don't close your eyes.

Carla, are you improving? Face is improving, yes.

Hmm. Vibrations.

Good. Feet, feet, continuously.

You cannot think about them. You just have to see it.

Now another group. All of you have been? All right? All of you all right? Now. Those who have not rubbed my feet before, come forward.
Where's the Kumkum? Or not had done my pujas. Come along, come forward. Now you get the Kumkum, all right. Come along. Take this and rub it on my foot. Come along.
[Hindi]
Hold it. Hold it. Now. Their hands are cooler than my feet today. [Shri Mataji is laughing]
That's the best part!
[Hindi conversation]

On the sole.
Sahaja Yogi: This is Rustom.

Shri Mataji: Ah! I could make out. [Hindi conversation]
He writes tremendous poetry.
Rub it hard.
[Hindi conversation about a photo]
Thank you.
[Hindi]

We won't need cameras, I think. Clouds will start showing.
[Shri Mataji is laughing]
No, no, it's all right. I'm just joking. In the clouds, the photographs are coming now. Vishnumaya. Electricity.

Good, now see. See your vibrations.

[Hindi conversation]

You all can act as actors and actresses.
[Laughter]
In the normal films, what do they show? One car is going. Another car is running. This car is going fast. Another car follows it. All that nonsense, you have.
Sahaja Yogi: That’s right.
Shri Mataji: Or else, if you have a good actor, someone who is a good actor, he carries the film on his head. But mostly, I've seen, there are very, very few good films which have any messages. But now Mr. Rajneesh has been exposed. You can show all these people in a film.

[Hindi conversation]

At times in London. I had come out that Beviner, what was his name? Bernard Bevin.
Sahaja Yogis: Bernard Levin.
Shri Mataji: Levin, Bernard Levin. He wrote a big article about Rajneesh.
Now. Those who have not rubbed on, you are all right? Enjoy it. Be careful with your hands. You can rub it on your head, it's better. You have red-headed.
[Laughter]
He'll have red-headed leads [unsure].
Both around. It's very good. Come along now those who have not done it.

Now we can have something like that.
Sahaja Yogi: Since they're going to get married again, the married wanted you to bless them. Shri Mataji: Oh, I see, good. All right.
Sahaja Yogi: They are both in the film making.
Shri Mataji: What about the pictures you wanted to show Me?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Mother.

[Hindi conversation]

Shri Mataji: Any nationality preference for, no?
Well, he’s asking a question if any nationality –
Shri Mataji: Are you willing to marry outside of the US?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Or Canada?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: To marry any nationality?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Is there any nationality you don't want to marry?
Sahaja Yogi: No.
[Laughter]
Shri Mataji: I mean, we’ve seen everything. Is there any particular person whom you want to marry? Yes. Gayle. Who’s Gayle?
Sahaja Yogi: That’s Gayle, here.
Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. That's great.

[Laughter]

But where is he? Where is he gone?
Sahaja Yogi: Where is he, Mother, this boy? He's out in California. He could get here.
Shri Mataji: All right. And where did he meet her?
Sahaja Yogi: Gayle. Where did he meet him?
Gayle: Where?
Shri Mataji: Where did you meet him? California.
Sahaja Yogi: Quite a few years.
Gayle: Seven years ago.
Shri Mataji: Oh, that's great. All right, that's very beautiful. So, it's solved. This one is solved. [Laughter]
Sahaja Yogi: This one is on.
[Applause]
