 "Knots of the Three Channels", public programme, Caxton Hall, London (UK), 2 October 1978.

The Kundalini rises, but that is not the end of it because human being is the instrument in which this light is manifested but once it is manifested it is not necessary that it will be all the time solving problem. There is a possibility, mostly it is a possibility that the light can go out in the room, outside is amazed, that it can go out. It can also subside a little bit it may come out it may flicker; it may dwindle a little bit. Because human beings as they are, they have got into three complications as soon as you become human beings these three complications start. And because of three, these three complications, one has to know that if you have to get out of that you have to break certain knots they call it Granthi (knots) in the Sanskrit language, which are giving you this falsehood in the meantime.

Falsehood that we think that you see in this world after all everything is science and everything is what we see and everything beyond and all those sorts of things are really false because unless and until you rise into reality you believe in them. After all what is God and what is all this talk of religion? What is the talk of Christ? And what is the talk of all these things? So all these problems become sort of identified with you absolutely you believe in the falsehood all the time. You are more concerned about the falsehood than about the truth. Even if you are concerned about the truth when you are born with a seeker mind, seeker's minds, then you try to see and you try to think of something that is beyond. And you try to understand that there must be something beyond and something must happen but still you see you are bound by these three complications in life by which by these three complications we accept the world as it is because we do not know the reality. The problem is we do not know the reality. Till we come inside the reality, we really do not know even what is reality.

What is the basic substance of our being? How do we live? What is the subtle being? How do we live and what is our aim? What we have to fulfill? All these questions are very weak in our mind; then we start seeking here and there, we go round here and there and try to find out. We talk to people, we read books and especially we go to books which are philosophical and try to find out about what must be done about reality. Why are we born towards this? Why are we not happy? Why do we feel dissatisfied in life? Why do we all the time hanker after sometimes something and we do not feel fulfilled within ourselves and why don't we understand the meaning of our own being? Why are we driven like this?

All these questions come to us. All these questions come to us and we start seeking about it and actually our priorities, before we get into it, are so false because we do not know reality. So I mean its not your fault except if you do not know reality and then actually for example somebody has to catch the train itself is very important then to go in town is very important then to get some money is important and to get a house is important and then to get/have some children is important all these things become very much more important than they should be. Why the main thing that is to seek within yourself. The point what are we to seek and what is so important about it, that every scripture has talked about this that you must seek within yourself, you must find out yourself who you are. What is the reason why all of them have been so much stressing? So until you enter into it you will not enter.

It is such a vicious circle because of these three complications I was telling you but because if as it is described that your spirit is absolutely a detached personality it's a detached being; it is not contaminated by anything it is absolutely complete by itself. It is joy. It is bliss. It is the truth. Where are we then? Why are we in such a mood that we have something very important for us in our lives, very special for us? We think that, this must be done or I must do these things. Then why, if that spirit is such a powerful thing, then what is the complication? What are the complications we have and how do we get rid of these complications? Through your evolution from the amoeba stage you can see even from the absolutely from the, we call it the 'jad' the dead from the absolutely from the material stage to this stage it has achieved quite a lot of detachment in a way. Detachment has come in a way that you understand that you are not the dead; no, you are not, that much at least everybody knows, that you are not. There are so many things you are identified with but at least you know that you are not dead. With the growth of materialism and by changing matter and its forms and all that, then you realize one more thing that matter doesn't give us happiness. I mean many people through evolution realized this, that matter is not the end of our lives and it is not going to give us happiness; then in a subtler form when you evolve even more, then you go into the art and the dignity of the matter then you start seeing a little deeper then what the matter means to you and you start thinking about its beauty, its' forms, its combinations and its' harmony. So the subtleties about matter develop, up to a point. You give it rationality and understanding, that you realize that this is this art, also has its finite nature, I mean how far can you go with it? I mean even if you have art and you become an artist and you are destined to be very rich. There are people who can be called as masters of art and those who are really aesthetically evolved people, but if you go and see their lives you get a shock you realize what kind of artists are these?

I mean they are producing art and beautiful things and nothing goes inside; they are very materialistic, they can be mad people or they can be absolutely obnoxiously, boring. So why is it that these artists you see, those who are creating all this, supposed to be something which is joy giving are so boring themselves and nothing goes inside them and apart from that they are so oppressive and so much sometimes can be very egoistical or can be very very methodical or meticulous and they could be absolutely mathematical about things. You start understanding that they are not that abstract, as they produce. You see they give some ideas and projections they do but they are not so. So again when you start thinking how is it that this matter, which has gone to this subtle state, which is called as art and artists. Why is it that this matter has not anything in it to offer us of, of that eternal value or of that nature which is promised to us through our scriptures?

So some people do at this point. Definitely they step over and I say or they just, just collapse on that point. And in the sense they think oh, there's nothing in scriptures, its' all a mess, it's all wrong, there may not be anything. You see it's a tall story told to us and there may not be any truth about it; that there is all pervading power and there is this God and you can become one with God. It can not be true after all you can see that there is so much of poverty in this world, there is so much of pain in this world, people are so unhappy, how can there be a God? Alright, all this! I get letters of that kind many a times, you see; that how people are so unhappy and they are this and that and then how can you talk of God? So this is the one complication we have and this is the complication comes because we the Atma, the Spirit is enveloped by our attention into the matter; because the matter has risen our attention, has come from outward and it has risen up to a point where there is a knot by which we can not see the spirit but we see the matter.

This knot, I mean, you see there is a big controversy about names. I would not like you to confuse it but we can say like that, this knot is a knot which is a knot between the spirit and the matter which is called as [Jad-prakruthi] in the Sanskrit language. This is the first knot which is a very difficult knot. We think this gem is mine or we think this chair is mine. You see even if somebody offers you a chair: come along sit here and then another person is still a little oh, she has given her a chair which is higher. You see, all kinds of complications human beings have. It's very delicate. They are, they are so foolishly identified with things, that supposing a person is more and more you see in the politics now. There's a prime minister and he thinks that someone is sitting on a chair; and he thinks that somebody is going to occupy that chair; and then you see all kinds of funny things start in his mind and all kinds of complications start. And he thinks that he'll be dislodged from that chair by which he's been a prime minister, so he starts working out his own plans and things. I mean the priorities are so much that you start what you call candidacy for him and everybody going for an election, and everybody fighting. The whole world is at these days, you see how to achieve that chair, that position by which he can become the prime minister. And the other one doesn't come and the others are working it out and you see it is very important. And what is he putting on the chair, is another dead stuff. You see one dead is down back on another dead. He's dead as far as so many things are concerned which are thought as the truth.

Because he doesn't know the truth. Now supposing you meet somebody as a high priest. Now he is a high priest on a chair; to me, I see one dead thing sitting on another dead thing, that's all, because the chair doesn't understand these things, the one who's put on the chair doesn't understand these things like that because it doesn't got the awareness to see what is the truth. What's the use of doing such a jocular thing? It's really a joke but people are very serious about it very serious, absolutely they do all kinds of things for these relations its' so serious but if you stand from this angle and you should see that you must try [unclear]. You see it's quite silly. But we have to accept it because we have decided to identify through this one Granthi or you can call it this knot of the Jad-Prakruthi or what you call as this matter.

Now for a Sahaja Yogi it is essential to see how far he is identified with his Jad-Prakruthi. It's very important to see how far he has identified with his, what you call the attachment or the covering of this deadening. All that is subconscious is all what you call conditioning is done. Everything that is dead is dead. Whether it is your dead matter or a dead thought. It's just the same and the more you harbor on it, you see there are silly people I have known, I mean they have come to me in the thing. You see supposing a wife has died, say about thirty five years back alright? Say he is here weeping and crying; write poetry about her she's dead, up to thirty five years back. She might have been reborn as a child somewhere or something like that, he can't marry her again, nothing of the kind. He is writing poetry about her crying, weeping and he expects everybody to weep. There are people, I have seen, they sit down and they just weep about it. They just play records and things, melancholy things and just wasting all their precious tears on something that is dead and finished. Now there is no need to weep about it but they'll go on like that and they enjoy such a thing very much and they appreciate it very much. It's no surprise but people go on wasting their energy they enjoy it in a way that we it is written down the whole melancholy of singing their dynamic experiences [unclear] is with them in memory.

Whatever was false should become nothing in your mind when you reach reality. So a memory in a Sahaja Yogi is of no value much value because whatever he had was in a dead condition he was not sensitive to all pervading power at that time. He was just dealing with the dead stuff you see and that was what I was surprised when many people told me Mother, after becoming a Sahaja Yogi we can not read any melancholy poems. I said thank God a lot of time is now saved for meditation; otherwise imagine all of them coming with very melancholy faces to me and saying that Mother you know this poet has already has a department of people who read all kinds of books, that why such a person should write like that and why such a person should write like that. In the same way they would say, why such a person ignored by Me? I do not even see his face. You see when we pass that way, I see really melancholia personified and he made everybody miserable himself. What was he crying about? I mean if you see that whom did he make happy? If he made everyone happy, why was he crying all the time and making everyone unhappy? So this kind of a person is there all this is dead and takes yourself to dead. So dead and dead things can never give you happiness. On the contrary it gives you habits they give you habits and these habits come to you like say, you have you have appreciated to sit on the chair you can not sit on the ground. Now if I tell the Sahaja Yogi's they must learn to sit on the ground they will immediately start that we must sit on the ground. That's not the point! What I am saying the habit the chair has given should be gotten rid of but for that you don't waste your energy, for heavens sake! Because if I say that then you shouldn't try wasting your energy in getting rid of the habits that were there; on the contrary if you put your attention to your spirit to what you have achieved, to where you are gradually you'll find your habits will drop off like that. We have known that.

We have had alcoholics with us here; terrible alcoholics who could not give up alcohol. And they have given up. We have had people who have taken drugs; they have given up without any difficulties, cigarettes they have given up. There are some also higher vices and bigger vices also people have given up. And some vices we can not mention, people have given up. So this happens when your attention goes to your spirit and this is a very big detachment that comes to you through your ascent, into that realm where you feel the all pervading. It means automatically your detachment works. It means your attention has changed definitely that oneness with reality, otherwise why are you getting detached?
And spontaneously it happens suddenly you mature so much. Sahaja Yogi's mature so fast, I mean jet lag maturity, I think. Because when they rise nobody understands whenever they say something people say what are you talking about? Because they are at such a different level that others just don't understand what they are talking about. And they find it very difficult to understand. Easy whenever they talk, others say "what are you saying about, we don't follow?" So the attention went to this and to that, your habits drop but for that it is essential that your attention should be on your spirit.
Now what is the beauty of spirit is for a Sahaja Yogi. What does he get out of spirit? What is the manifestation of spirit is that when his attention is absolutely one with the Atman, with the spirit then there is a manifestation of vibrations. You start getting cool breeze in your hands. Now these vibrations are there from the very beginning of the matter, up to the vibrations, where you come up to a human level. Say you can call them, these are electromagnetic vibrations. But when they go on improving, you see in the beginning, they just look like electromagnetic, then they look like more. There is emotions in it, you see then you go a little ahead then you find that these vibrations also act, these vibrations also think, they also report, so you see gradually you will find that with the growth of human being as a human being from matter these vibrations have also manifested into different categories. So begin with, these vibrations are only electromagnetic, you can say in the matter. Say you have Sulphur Dioxide as a molecule you’ll find Sulphur and Dioxide both are vibrating all the time like that, but when it goes on manifesting more and more that’s the basics then gradually the manifestation of these higher things can be perceived through our understanding of Sahaja Yoga but for a normal person it is only electromagnetic.
Now supposing a matter which is say, just a matter, say a dead matter, it is. Now it is not aware that it has got vibrations to begin with, it has not aware. It doesn’t even think about it. I mean it has no awareness at all of any kind, it’s just, so but there are vibrations there are electromagnetic vibrations which it is not aware. Now supposing such a dead matter if you tell that dead matter that you have vibrations it will say, “what are you talking about?” I never felt it, but somebody else can feel it that there are electromagnetic vibrations in the same way every human being has got these vibrations within him in the spirit but they are only manifested when he gets realization
So the second category of the same thing, the same vibrations start expressing higher and higher qualities about it; like from one seed a tree moves and flowers come out and different fragrance like that, you see the growth is more and more. But the basic is electromagnetic vibrations that you can feel it everywhere in the matter with your naked eyes, a human being can see. Now see your own growth. Have you recognized it that animals don’t know that there are electromagnetic vibrations but human beings.
But a Sahaja Yogi knows that there are not only electromagnetic but there are all kinds of manifestation of these vibrations. So electromagnetic are important at a point and then other vibrations are even much more important. So all these vibrations are combined together absolutely completely in human beings which they manifest gradually and they act according to the need of the time. So much so that in these vibrations there is a somebody who thinks, vibrations who think, the vibrations who cooperate, who cure, who relate things, who report things all that you think in the human awareness that you are doing like telecommunications you have got big telecommunications sitting down here. You say can show something that is happening in India or something like that. In the same way these vibrations can be blown things to (unclear, near meaning). the complete telecommunications is built in these vibrations then you can cure people sitting down, you can raise their kundalinis sitting down, you can work out on people sitting down here all these far fetched things are possible. Those who have been Sahaja Yogis have realized it and seen it and worked it out. And it’s more surprising now we have a lady here sitting down; say her husband used to drink a lot, everybody knows her story very well and we just send some vibrations and he stopped drinking. He stopped his drinking and just to rinse that through vibrations it was done. I used something which is very simple it’s a lime. It’s a living lime and we put all the vibrations into that and we put them near the head of the patient and they suck the negativity of the person and the person gives up drinking.
We have seen one boy who used to come here, a little boy who would run all over the places and would not sit down for even for a minute. He was possessed, he was horrid and now he is a sensible boy. He started going to school. He never used to attend even a word and now he started speaking. So all these things happened with the lime. So, what how is it, Mother a lime is such a thing now, for a very up to date person it is funny to see limes being used for vibrations. They are actually ultramodern things you know, ultramodern. I am not talking of only modern but ultramodern things are limes; are very ultramodern things because you vibrate the ultramodern limes by your vibrations, and you put them under the pillow. Now these limes have a specialty these have been found out by many people long time back that they have a specialty to suck in the vibrations and contain the vibrations or to not only electromagnetic but quite a lot of vibrations can be in it, because they are living and they have a co-efficience. They have a kind of coefficience by which they suck in these vibrations in them and then they relay, they throw these vibrations whenever it is necessary. It is not the limes who do it but the vibrations who are containing in them that they do it. How they are, I’ll tell you.
You can think of a battery that you are creating. You create a battery. Now the battery can not do anything but if you take the battery near some points then it starts working because it is inside. In the same way we really make it into a battery. When they are near the heads of the people, these limes, you see they are doing nothing; but these vibrations come out and they start working it out. It’s a perfect field. They do it. They know they are perfect. You don’t have to tell them. They understand much more than you do. They are controlled much better and they know how to find the ways to extract the negativity, It sounds very funny to other people. You see that's why I tell only Sahaja Yogis don't give out all the secrets just now, let them come in slowly, let them settle down, let them get vibrations and then we'll talk because I've seen a few times if you not only talk but if they see some limes some people will run away, thinking its all hocus pocus. You see they don't want to hear it. Really it's a fact because people believe in some sort of a funny thing. Supposing I have big circles and all those things that the people do, I don't know what all they do, but some sort of a funny thing. You see they like it. For example, if I make you all jump on your heads and shout loudly and make some nuisance out of it there would be thousands coming to this group. I can assure you; but you see, if you are really knowing about reality and if you are handling these vibrations, well then, you people won't come and that's why many people go to that. Why? Because the same, the complication, the complication is still at work you see. So to please them you have to use their complications. And those who do not want people to know reality or those who I would say do not know reality, those people who just want to make use of all this, they use this complication. So they try on human beings and that's how they trap the disciples and that's how they manage thousands of people bringing money and giving them honor and all those things which are useless for a person who has known reality. For him money makes no difference. I mean he understands the joke of the money and he understands the joke of everything else but those who have want to use this complication. So this one is described, I will use the name that was used by Shankaracharya. Because you see everybody is not a realized soul and of a great authority but we have to have some people as authority so Shankaracharya has called Brahmagranthi he calls it Brahmagranthi. Brahmagranthi because the Brahma is the vibrating force, Brahma OHM that is the vibrating force because it's the vibrations as they called it of the Brahmagranthi.

Now the second one is the one by which we think that we can do something. Now this one is the superego one, the first one I told you about creates the superego, this Granthi, the knot. How do you have a knot? I'll give you an example of a balloon. Say for example, a balloon. Now a balloon has lots of air in it but it will all pass out, it won't be there if there is no knot there. You see but if there is a knot which can hold the balloon, alright and this is the balloon we have in our head which we call a superego which we can see here clearly, can you show that? The black one, you know the black you know what is this one is the superego by which you see you get possessed, you get all mad and you do all kinds of things. This is the Brahmagranthi. This knot is there. And this knot, you see it first starts at the Mooladhara. It starts from there. The knot starts from there, can you imagine? It starts from there! Because this one is made of Prithvitatwa it's made of the earth element so from the very beginning from the earth element itself, the knot starts. But as there's a knot you see when you make a knot always there is an unwinding, always. You come by a staircase you always can go down. Is there a staircase by which you can not go down but only come up? In the same way, if you have made a knot there must be a way of going out of the knot you see. So the going out of the knot is worked out through Sahaja Yoga; that also is done through vibrations

That the first, this knot has to be released. Once this knot is released then only the Kundalini starts. This is the first knot, is much more important. So this first knot is very strong among Indians and is not so strong with you. Though in a way you have done not great harm, but his one is not so strong at least those who are seekers you're not so materialistic, in the sense at least in your rationality, I think you are. But I would say that you are not so much worried about your food and things like that as the Indians are. I mean they can't help themselves. They have to worry about their food and all these things. Of course [unclear] you are not so much worried about these things, but there is also another problem that comes with all this affluence, that in a very subtle way, very subtle way you are materialistic. Because if you see, if there is one bean increased the whole thing topples down. It's what happens in India. Even if there are three beans increased nobody would bother because they know we will have another because they are so much used to a kind of calamity, all the time falling on them. Alright if you can't get bread we'll make something else. Alright they are not so much disturbed as you people are. You become overly sensitive even to your materialism you are very sensitive and your materialism starts becoming so funny that it amounts to fuss. It's fussy, it's a fussy materialism which is such a headache, I tell you. That I mean even what people are wearing and how they are dressed.

Now supposing you are wearing a suit. Then they say he is a very suity fellow and if he is not wearing a suit then he is very casual, you see. So that everything has a name something like that and everything can be regarded as a banner I mean who has got time to think about who is wearing what, who's a suity or a booty whatever it is. But these things make you sort of brand a person. That a person is his house is like this so he must be like this. It is not so. You see here the knot is so subtle in a sense that rationality you see gives you this sense, that by judging it, by that you judge a person, judge a person by his appearance. Say supposing I were a form and I tried to do some tricks. You see some juggling. I showed you some money taking out some sort of a ring or something like that. It really, really makes you feel that there must be something about it or even higher than that if I say that alright, you can have your sex habits as you like. You can have ten women around you. It doesn't matter and if you see someone like that you can call him a sadhu, it is such a big myth that it is such a falsehood, it is absolutely nothing but I would say complete darkness, it is. People will accept it, because it will sound fantastic to them, because it will support that materialism that a person like that. You see in India, say there is a sage and you say that by sex you will go to God. Immediately people will jump on it because you see we are so much endowed with sex energy. All these things happen in a society which is supposed to be absolutely non-materialistic so this materialism works out and this Granthi, what I call the Brahmagranthi, is the involvement or you can say the falsehood , the falsehood of matter ; the falsehood of matter works through this and one goes on believing it and believing it.

So the second thing starts with it that people say let us give up this falsehood. And they start all kinds of another artificial method. After all materialism gives you artificiality in the sense that when you are, your attention is involved into things which are not real which is not reality, the natural interest in artificial stuff. Everything becomes artificial. And when the artificiality becomes too much. Then what happens, artificially you try to give it up, this is the second side. The second side of it, artificially you think we should give it up. For example, alright today I am going to wear a dress like an ascetic. We had some people who said that we can not give up these dresses of primitive people. I said "but why?" Because we want to become primitive. Now you can not become primitive. It's a fact! You must accept it. Yes, alright dress up as you like, there's nothing important. You dress up like anything but you don't think by dressing up anything; you're going to become anything. It's not! It is not important at all. Whatever way you may dress up, whatever thing you may dress up, whatever you may do has no bearing on your inner yoga. Inner yoga works out by itself, it works out through chakras, it goes inside, it's a subtle thing which is a detached thing from how you dress, how you walk, how you talk. It's not the point once this yoga works out then of course, the things change outside; because your face glow, you become magnetic, you talk in a way which is authoritative, you start curing people you start doing many things which shows that you are a different person. That's a very different thing all together. But normally by doing it outside, artificially doing something, you see this is another kind of a Granthi, they call a knot; and this knot starts by identifying yourself by thinking that if you do something then you are going to achieve by sort of doing some sort of an effort or by doing some sort of a penance or sort of standing on your heads or so called Hatha Yoga.

You do all these things that people do in the name of God also. Also all these things you think you are going to achieve is another falsehood because with this falsehood that knot becomes stronger and stronger doing anything what you call is the Rajoguna is the right side action, the left side action is now described to you it starts at the Mooladhara, and the right side action which is the Rajoguna which is within you which is the activity within us by which you do something we want to do something which is done through our Ahamkara, is through your ego which is there and all this falsehood doesn't lead you anywhere. Because whatever you do, you do not do any living work, you do all dead things. Supposing you have made this chair what have you done? You have just changed a tree into a dead stuff and then made a chair that's all. Dead into dead, you have not created any living thing just all dead; any human beings have done nothing.

And if evolution is a living process you are going on living you have to do something living, on the contrary if you are doing something dead and believing that you are doing something living then it's even a greater falsehood but if you realize that we are doing nothing, that is living. For that something has to happen that we should be endowed with that power by which we do living things. If this is accepted then the things work out, otherwise not. If people say no I am the prime minister say I am the king, I am the xyz you may be anything state or you are a dead person. it matters nothing. You might be an engineer, alright you are, you arrange machinery alright you are say for example you arrange in machinery or something to work out they're going to the dead and coming back dead. What have you achieved? Put them on your heads? What living thing have you done out if it? Just think of it.

What efforts! What mind! They commit to religion, also behave in the same manner, meaning if we go to church, for example, some people believe in it. Some of you are sensible enough to understand that by going to church and listening to a priest you are not going to achieve that, in a sensible thing that way. Even by going to temples, you are not going to achieve, take it from me. Going to any lectures, you are not going to achieve. They are just going to talk, talk, talk, which is a dead thing, which becomes dead in your mind. Nothing but conditionings. By reading books, you're not going to achieve it either. Books are dead. You read the books; you accumulate more dead on your left hand side. By the right side, you do the thing by accumulating the left side. But you use also the left side for your right side because you say you read a book so yes, yes, yes, you see now Mataji is not that person. You see because this was written and how Mataji explains that. All the time you are playing with these two knots within you Rajoguna and Tamoguna. These two knots are within you and that's why your attention is not on the spirit.

Thirdly, Sattwaguna we can call it is the one by which we try to know God is the one by which we try to see things that, no, this is not alright. We give up this and give up that and we should take to Rajoguna. But we should give up Rajoguna; we should take to subtler one. Is the central path, where we try to say we must do God. But what can we do to do God?

You people think by meditating. You see some people have told me "Oh, I have been meditating Mother for the last twenty five years. I say, "What have you been meditating?" I mean there have been people I know who have been meditating. But where, but how? It's funny you know how people can do it. We had neighbors there and somebody had given them a mantra and he was a man, a very big man. I should say he was a governor of Bank of India and they would get a photograph six o'clock they were meditating and saying some sort of a mantra absolutely rumble tumble and they were doing it and doing it and doing it till it was about twenty years. And they absolutely became dilapidated. Their hands become like this, feet become like this and swollen bodies and all that, then they died. Till then they were going on and on until the end, and even when they could lay down in bed they could not watch even for one minute they had become completely dead. You wouldn't believe how they had become. I wish I had shown you their photographs. Absolutely bedridden and their bodies were swollen up and they could not even move their legs and food was given to them and somebody used to take them out and do everything. I mean they couldn't move any part of their body. They were all deadened and finished like that. And they still were saying the mantras. I said now where are you going after these mantras? They said, you see our mother; they have a mother; and their mother had promised when you will die you will [unclear] They died, nothing happened, the body was so [unclear] nobody could [unclear] It was a big problem so they were deadening themselves all the time they were deadening and deadening instead of going towards life, they were deadening themselves. Now you see I could not tell them anything because they were not well. They would not listen to me. They had become so much addicted to that habit of saying mantra that even doctor could not do anything about it. Nobody could do anything, they would not take medicine they would just do mantra and their mouth was saying mantra and the whole body was stiff like that.

And people said what great people have died, you know we must take [unclear] you know. You start looking at them and say "why?" Oh, you know the people they came and they said great people have died and they took the name of God. And then you blame God; why is that they took the name of God and why did they die? I mean you must see where you are hitting your head. Supposing that is the door and you go on hitting your head here then you say Mother we hit our head twenty years why didn't you tell me the way I mean this is not the way. The way is there. That's the way we have to get it. If this is not the way, why are you hitting there? This is because of the Rajoguna problem, the Rajoguna problems that we can do something about it; people just cannot believe that you just can not do anything about it because in a very very subtle way Mr. E-G-O is present. You say anything to them immediately it comes up like a snake, I've seen it. Oh, Mataji said that "no, I can't bear it". Why did she say that? Why did I say that, is that I see things, that's what I'm saying. You will also come on this side one day and you will start seeing what and see what I say is absolute truth or not. [Unclear] why should I say it is the main point. I do not want to disturb you. I've brought you; I've called you here to give you something special. Alright if that is so, let's have a compact some sort of a compact deal about it that I give you something and then you receive it and the compact the whole thing should work in you and then you decide about it. Instead of that if one body says immediately, a mistake comes, "oh, she said this to us, that's wrong". Now what should I say you're alright. You may not see you're perfect. Is that the way should I pamper your ego; no, it should not be so. Neither do I condemn people. I do not say, "it is because you are like this you're condemned", no, but you must see the reality; that you are not there as yet, the reality has not come to you. The reality as a whole.

For example, I am a Mother and you are hitting your head here. Now if I tell you, "My child for heavens sake don't hit your head, you'll break your head. Go there there's the door." And then you say I am on my own who are you to tell me? Now this is too much for a Mother to bear. Now she says please see this is the door you get out of this door. That's why you need a mother. You don't need anybody else because anybody else would just say, "Oh, alright go ahead and break your head and finished with it, good ridden to bad rubbish". But a mother is not like that. She thinks about it, she thinks, "oh, My children are there, they are seeking, they are seekers." I have to go on telling them. Telling them, at least but they go on hitting their heads, whatever you may talk, you see unless and until this wisdom comes into the head. It's such a vicious circle, I tell you. And this wisdom can not come until this lowest Granthi breaks, the lowest knot breaks, where a person starts understanding one simple point that human beings cannot do it. God has to do it. So the surrendering starts. God has to do it. We can not do it. The only thing we have to say Lord please, that's all. You have to just knock at the door. You don't have to argue out whether Christ was correct or not or Buddha was correct or not, don't discuss any dogmas. All these people, all those who are supposed to be in charge of religions have created nothing but useless dogmas to quarrel and fight. I am amazed to see these people when they have their meetings and we have to discuss, who is going to be elected for this and what is going to be the agenda for the budget of this thing, and then lastly what will be the menu for next year? That's all they do. I mean if that is God's job, I am quite surprised and you should be. I mean is this the way these people are going to bring reality within you by bringing you all kinds of unreal and useless things? And they are doing it and we are in it all the time, we are in it, we are identified with it because see we think.

[Missing the beginning of the sentence] ...this yellow stuff is absolutely. it gives you also, to Me, nauseous a feeling of...most of these people, egoistical, have bad liver and also they have what they get as known as migraine and also they get all liver problems and this yellow color specially is expressing their liver. Then they think on top of that, what's wrong in doing it? Already we are on one side and what's wrong, then we start drinking. Because we must deny all that is good. Now let me tell you one thing whatever things people do which are egoistical, you think that they do that destroys them. You see it's not a thing that they want to destroy themselves perhaps in a subtle way the ego wants to destroy itself. It is such a thing that they work it out such a sub human way. For example, for a person like I cannot understand a man who goes to a pub and sees another person coming in and falling down all over, you see such a man coming out then how do you get entertained it's like a lunatic asylum. I mean if you go to lunatic asylum and you see a lunatic coming out then you would not like to go inside. But this is I can't understand how human beings can conceive. Now you know it very well that nobody so far has been even honored because he is a drunkard. Has there been any one in the whole world? The whole world might preach but is there anybody honored?

In the history I would like to, anybody honored? Any man who has deceived his wife and his married ten women has been honored for that? Is there anybody honored? I mean they say that's many geniuses, I call them geni'asses' are like that he maybe. They are just like radiograms you see from there some music is coming but it doesn't do anything inside. And there if they become your models you might be become geniuses without even any genius in you. So all fine models we set up but do we ever erect their, their statue? Do we garland them? Do we worship them? Why? Whatever you may say against Christ I don't say that to you. Anybody can stop you I mean because you are on your own. You see, on your own trip is one of the worst trips that I could think of. What have you found so far to be on your own? Nothing! You haven't found your own properties. You haven't found out your own making. You have not found out the beauty that you are. What are you? Will you go out anywhere without taking any money with you? You don't even have a ticket. So just it's a joke about that you are on your own; you are not! You're not because your own is missing, is missing. It's not there. You have to find out that own. Our attention should be on that own and why? Why do we always indulge into these three complications all the time like even in the center? Even not so subtle? Because we feel and people do that's also a very modern, modern blessing, I would say that everyone feels the need to seek.

But when you see how Joan of Arc was punished and how kings happened in past, how people were mad and dogmatic and egoistic in the name of religion. You don't know what to do. You see the funny people, then you get all these horrible gurus coming here and taking money from you and doing all kinds of things. You think what's all going on, then you see people, these are some giving sermons and lectures and all their private life. Nothing in them bubbling, nothing so special, nothing so sweet about that. Then you feel what is this going on? And that is the central path where you are really seeking and then you say no let me do it myself. I can assure you, you cannot. It's not meant to be, why? I mean if somebody says alright you come to my house. Just come down and you'll get it. Why do you want to do it still? What is the reason? There are many people who have been here who don't like when I tell them please give up this mantra of yours. It's not going to do any good to you. They say, "why Mataji?" They become the mantra and the mantra itself is rumble tumble, you know. Nobody knows a word about Sanskrit; nobody knows a word about what it is means, where to take which mantra, there is no living process behind it, nothing. I'm shocked at it sometimes. Sometimes I feel, "what are you taking upon yourself?" But when you tell about the reality and you tell them this is how it works out. And it has to work out within you, it is an internal working, it is an internal yoga which has to work out, which you have to feel it yourself. You have to see yourself and you have to see it in others and you have to work it out. This is also because of the third, beside integration you have of your satwa. Because artificiality starts from the very beginning the artificiality goes on and on till even you come to Sattwaguna which is the seeking. In seeking there's also artificiality.

Now if I may tell you that I can see you through and through, it's a fact. I can. Now you put up a show before me whatever show you want but I can see it. But I do not show, I don't want to show it. It's alright sometimes I'm very unhappy when I see some people; I know there's a big problem about them. Because you haven't got that experience but supposing when you become a Sahaja Yogi you experience it. Those who have got it can feel it. You feel so concerned about things and sometimes you feel very elated to see some people are in a very good shape and some are in a very elated shape. I can see you through and through, I can see everything but still My love is such subtle. It doesn't allow me to see, those things that will recede my attention. I can see My love. It tries to build [inaudible]. Then My attention is a very special stuff you see it goes to a great extent. Now the love and the attention [inaudible]. In my case you see My love is in My heart. This is my left side and this is my right side. It plays hand in hand with the attention. Now attention is in the center and my Sahaja Yoga is on the right hand side. So the attention is also very stubborn. It plays to a point, it goes up to a point then it recedes back, again, it goes down. It's alright, you forget it. You just can't do it. Because you see love can also spoil so they balance like in a driving role I'm an accelerator and you can put an accelerator to a point but if it goes beyond a point then it might spoil the whole joy [unclear]. It has to keep in relation with the whole program, with all the people around. Now say there's a person who comes here. He's a very troublesome fellow, he has very bad vibrations. He drinks and he troubles. And he just comes here to disturb, he argues. One day I tolerate him. Second time I tolerate, the third time he doesn't turn up, just doesn't turn up people don't know how he didn't come. Oh! He was transferred. I didn't do that but it happens. Attention just to see. No one knows what happens to such a person it's just because what is in a [unclear] Thousands and millions can be cured just like this. Why should God worry about people who are not interested in their own well being? He's not going to fall into [unclear]. He can create the whole universe; I mean He can create all other types of human beings. So this is also there for attention. You see it's very proud stuff. It has its own protocol and these protocols are divided into these seven centers. And any one of these Deities specially Christ, the Lord as you call Him, He is really the Lord you know [unclear] if He gets angry, it's impossible.

He loves you; no doubt, but to a point. He loves me much more than He loves you. If He finds that there is a problem for Me. He will have nothing to do with it. As long as you are receiving it and behaving yourselves alright. Same about Mahavira, same about Buddha. We are on one side, so they all support, they all help and all of them are absolutely in unison and has complete understanding. Nobody fights them. It's complete integration. Only I'm the person in between you see trying to say, "Alright, let's have it this way and that way. Let's do it." Like the chairman sitting on the chair telling alright, this is alright, please forgive! Please forgive him! But somehow it happens then for a Sahaja Yogi it is essential to know there are certain rules and regulations of Sahaja Yoga. Immediately your vibrations are less. I don't do anything. People say, "Mother you have taken away my vibrations?" I say, "why should I, why should I?" I'm fed up with this. I would love to give everything, all this to you but there's something wrong with you, what am I to do?

Now supposing you put a lid on top of a pitcher and put it in the Ganges and say, "No! Ganges is not flowing and what am I to do?" Remove the lid! And it is very subtle, very subtle. You don't realize how subtle. It's only in vibrations. "Oh God! I've lost my vibrations". That's all. So vibrations are the most important things for Sahaja Yogis. Most important thing is to achieve a complete state of vibrations when your realization is completely integrated, your physical being, your emotional being, your spiritual being is complete [unclear]. It's a complete balance within you then only the vibrations flow and that's why Antaryoga is important. It is not only lecturing will help you but of course there are vibrations, they work out. I try to through My vibrations of My words to [unclear] but that is to a point. You have to yourself take up and work it out the Antaryoga, the inner yoga. By working it out in a way that you sit down meditate and do various things that Sahaja Yoga has suggested.

Now I have you know that my grandchildren are realized souls and they're very high quality realized souls and they understand a lot about Kundalini from early childhood. Yesterday one of the girls was feeling the left nabhi very much, all over you see. She said now I will know how to do it and she brought pieces of paper and she tied them round her neck then she took vibrations so she said they are all passing into my this paper. Actually while doing she was giving bandhan to it she was moving her own vibrations around it, she was winding it and then she put them and she said alright put them in the fire and they burned them and her attention was reduced and everybody felt better. [Unclear]And now this girl is seven but I have a granddaughter she's had it too. She just comes on to the point. This is the problem and I have a grandson who just climbs on somebody and he clears them out. His vibrations are clear, people have seen and there are many children like that, who are born in this country. How are you going to understand it? Only by attending to some sort of a meditation course or something like that, paying for it? No, you have to be [unclear].

Sahaja Yogis should realize one thing that they are the foundation of the new era. This is a very big responsibility and the foundations have to be very solid. They are made out of stones, no doubt but they have to be really solid; absolutely solid because they are in the foundation. They are chiseled out much more, they are to be cleared out much more but if the foundation is not good we cannot do it. A complete edifice cannot do anything about it. First, the foundation is important and that's why it's nice we have a few people but its taking bit too much time, I think the foundation itself. Every stone has to look after themselves and has to work it out in a much deeper way and work out the vibrations and must evolve with methods, all the methods by which your depth is done. Nothing is important like this, that every one of you should be real quality. In the end, I will just tell you that the subtle part of these chakras is how to understand that. The first side, the first entanglement with the Jad-Prakruthi as you call it, the matter is through the auspiciousness, auspiciousness. What is auspicious? What is not auspicious? If you understand the auspiciousness then you will understand that you can overcome the binding of the matter.

Now even auspiciousness can become quite maddening to people. I've seen it. I've seen people washing their hands sixty five times, pulling their hair hundred times. That's not the way but you must understand what is auspiciousness. For example, we can say how we sit in a program is not important so much, you may be little bit sometimes pushing back, pushing forward may be sitting anyway. That's not important but the auspiciousness of sitting is that have you reverence in your mind when you are sitting there should be reverence in you. When you are sitting for your meditation, are you taking upon yourself that "oh, I am going to achieve it today" or out of reverence you are sitting in a surrendering mood, in a surrendering position? The reverence part is very important. Once you start understanding reverence I've seen people putting both their legs close you see sitting down like that. I've seen people with very arrogant ways of sitting. For example, sitting like this you see before anybody who is supposed to be revered should not sit like this. If you sit like this then there is no reverence. This is you, sit when you are in authority of yourself with your both legs like this and sit in reverence. Now this pose is not important. You can be absolutely burning within you and could be sitting like so I'm again telling you auspiciousness is what is within you, what you think about it, what is happening to you? Are you feeling revered, reverence within you? Are you feeling the reverence by yourself? This is your own judgment. This is your decision. This is nothing to do with how you should sit, whether you sit on your one leg or two legs. This is not the most important but do you feel that by this you are relaxed and you are in a reverence position? This is the thing if you feel you are in a reverence position, that's all. That is what you have to do is to understand auspiciousness.

For an example, of auspiciousness. For example, now you are a wife in a family, you are a husband in a family; now how you treat your wife. Do you treat her like a goddess of the family, do you? Do you treat your husband as a man who brings God into family? You see this auspiciousness is the way, how you feel about, is the auspiciousness. How you feel about a chair. You sit on the chair; say for example now how do you feel about the chair? Do you feel it's a chair because it's very expensive; because it is your own or because somebody has given you? The reverence is there, about the chair, that no, it is the chair which was occupied by my mother, which is to be revered by my father, which is to be revered, or it is just a chair which is handled just for utility or you have just got it for a some sort of a [unclear] thing. Wherever you sit, now say for meditation you are sitting in a place. I've seen people sitting all kinds of funny things, in the name of meditation. For example, they'd be smoking first, you see, now what are you going to do the smoke, what you call the ashtray would be just there and then they would put their feet like this. Now let us do the meditation. This aspect is very much missing here because people have lost all that. I think they had it there very much there, but it is lost and auspiciousness is a very subtle thing which gradually when you train yourself you will understand. And by auspiciousness you will understand the value of matter. You will not value the matter but the auspiciousness. To you the important thing will be say a hair from the head of Mohammed Prophet. It's much more auspicious then all the world put together.

See I went to Kashmir as I told you and just crossing through I asked the driver, I said, "What's this place?" He said "Why?" I said. He's telling me, "What's this place? It's so beautiful?" My husband looked around; he said "What's beautiful about it? I don't understand there is nothing here, around?" I said "No, there is nothing, but there's a place just there you can see that by where the hair of Mohammed Prophet" So that's it. No joy, beauty I could ever get it from anywhere from any place, could be very beautiful, you may feel that this is the heaven here, for Me it may not be, it's really that place where one hair of Mohammed Prophet is there, its auspicious.

Auspiciousness is judged through vibrations. So you can not say how are you to judge the auspiciousness? So through your vibrations you can so use your vibratory awareness for auspiciousness. That's how you can look after your left side which I have told you in a very short way. For that you don't have to read books and you don't have to say, "How many times, Mother, I should wash my hands? How many times I should give you these bandhan and all that?" It's only when you get your vibrations that's the most auspicious time. Keep it at that point, because again and through the rituals you'll go, hold it with your left hand and hold it with your right hand and all going wrong and then some, "oh, Mother I did the wrong way, what is it?" That's all. The thing is the essence of it. If you get your vibrations alright, that's what is the auspiciousness. Maybe when you are sitting down you are not getting your vibrations, think that maybe something might go wrong with you. Is it I'm not revered properly? Let me have the vibrations. Why what's the matter, why is it that I am not feeling the vibrations? Well, that's how it should be. You can judge it through your vibrations. Now auspiciousness is very important for Sahaja Yogis because all that they do should be auspicious. Whatever is inauspicious you should not do.

Now you'll be surprised sometimes you might think that say going to a particular place but maybe you will find that you lost your purse or you cannot go there or may be that somehow or the other that the road is blocked, you might have to go back. Accept it. may be that is auspiciousness may be that you have to go that way, may be there is somebody who is waiting for you there; you have to give your vibrations to that place. There is some need there because you are an instrument of auspiciousness. You have to spread the auspiciousness. And what is auspiciousness? It is nothing but the blessings of God. You feel the blessings of God. He blesses you all the time. His hand is all the time on you. He looks after you. When you seek auspiciousness you seek His hand. You are always under His hand. He is your shepherd. You're all the time under His guidance. That is what auspiciousness is, in the real sense. To feel it, all the angels around you. Everybody, that everybody is trying to bring you to reality that is the auspiciousness of it. Once you start doing it gradually you will aspire the joy of giving the joy of God's blessing to you. When you will feel His hands. It is not important that you become very successful person. I've seen such successful people in life, so called 'successful' so unhappy, so miserable, so terrible, so boring and so troublesome. They are good for nothing. People say, "Oh! He has died, it's a good thing." They've been no good to anybody, nobody bothers about them. When they are in position people look after them once they are gone nobody even bothers about them. Auspiciousness give you right idea of divine importance means where divinity flows behind you, goes around you and takes you around and gives you the complete joy, the movement of the wave. It's a beautiful thing to be auspicious. It takes you away from inauspiciousness when you ask for auspiciousness. But do not make a ritual out of it, which I want to tell you hundred and hundred and one times that do not make a ritual of anything because you deaden it like all other people have done it. I hope after my death you people do not do that. Because then it becomes a superstition.

Auspiciousness should never be confused with superstition. Because people were not that alert and not so subtle they could not make out what is ugliness, that is superstition and what is beauty that is auspiciousness, they made all mistakes and they committed all this craps. But you people be careful, because you are subtle people. Do not make it a superstitious thing but an auspicious thing. When you speak it should be auspicious. I've seen many people who have a habit of speaking very inauspicious things, especially with the left vishuddhi. Very inauspicious. Like we invite somebody to your house for a dinner party. And he says, "Oh! I saw such a crowd coming in I felt that there was a fire on." What a thing to say! He thinks he is smart, a smart man to say such a thing or he'll utter a very dirty joke at the time when there is a wedding going on. There are many people. You see the inauspiciousness can form such a satanic force; most of the tantrism has come out of it inauspicious. Do you know this that tantrism is nothing but inauspicious mastery. Before the Deity, before the Gods, if you do something extremely inauspicious, you may loose the attention of the Gods and all its' protection to get out of it. Then you'll do all satanic things. This is the basis of all the sub-tantric.

What is hell? Is nothing but inauspicious living? Because the attention of this God is not on you, the blessings are not there. Then you will understand, that vibrations teach you auspiciousness. You think of somebody and you get stingy. Oh God! What a man he is? You may think he is a very big man. Immediately know and he is inauspicious. Sahaja Yogis should not aspire for the worldly success and worldly things but for auspicious things, so that they get the blessings of God. Because those who have got also all kinds of worldly things are the most wretched souls ever living and are cursed with this Mother earth. She is fed up with them. They are sinful. I do not want to tell you if people behave in this manner where they will go and what will happen because that's too much for me to say at this time. But that is what it is about your I would say your great poet say Blake has talked about it and told about it. The Hell, he described about it. So many of them have described I do not want to elaborate.

The other side is the right side how to get out of the second side of it. What is the subtle point of the right side? Is discipline. You see, first you have to say, England was a very disciplined country; over disciplined, artificially disciplined, militarily, regimentally. I do not mean that discipline at all. The discipline is within you, it comes automatically. Not regimentation, again the confusion should not be there because I'm going to make it extremely clear. It is very easy to confuse things because of these knots. So when I say that you must have discipline, is an inner discipline, absolute inner. You don't have to do anything about it. Because it is built in because you start enjoying that discipline within you. Discipline in Sanskrit language we can call it as "sadacharya", is good behavior actually if you translate it. But it is much more than that. Sadacharya is much more. It is a discipline. What we get up in the morning? How do we meet in the morning? The sun has risen. What's wrong in getting up at 10'o clock? Nothing wrong, but you are losing the beauty of the morning. Morning time is the time when the sun is coming, the rays are coming. That is the special time when the sun throws its' real rays of divinity. Actually the right side is the sun side. It starts with you rising in the morning, very much. But not the hatha yogi style where you become 'bony' people. Where you fast for three hundred days and then three hundred days you go on shouting at people and three hundred days you start cursing them. I do not mean that. By discipline I mean that a certain amount of respect for yourself. It is a respect as there is auspiciousness. This is a respect of your own being because it is ego. How much you respect your ego, Let Me see? Assert your ego is different from respect ego, your ahambhava, your dignity. Your position in life, how would you respect? Do you sell it for money? Do you sell it for a chair? Do you sell it for any positions in life? Kind of a discipline within yourself. Not to jabber too much, not to talk less. But that doesn't mean that you are trying sort of balancing it. It's something innately built in which can work out through Sahaja Yoga if you see your vibrations again. You have to be respected. In the first one, you have to respect and in the second one, you have to be respected. Respect yourself. People think that supposing if they don't bathe their body. Or must do it. What's wrong? Nothing wrong. If you do not going to respect yourself, nature is not going to respect you. You physically you should respect, mentally, emotionally. If say you, if you'd like to see pornographic photos. You have no respect for yourself. If you want to eat filth, you have no respect for yourself. You do not think much of yourself. You want to waste your eyes; you want to waste your attention. You should not like that is absurd, useless, frivolous. You shouldn't charge your chakras with something nonsensical and filthy. When you start respecting yourself you will really know how to respect others. Those who cannot respect themselves cannot respect others. And respect that is good in others. And do not worry about their faults but respect them for their good so that you also have good in you and you respect yourself.

That is not asserting, this respect is never asserting. All it's very comforting, extremely comforting. A person who respects himself is the most congenial person to live with. He doesn't come forward too much neither he recedes back too much. He's just there. He provides you know he's there. You can always adore such a person. He doesn't do anything outwardly. He doesn't try to show off. He doesn't try to create sort of all rob-out here you know. He's not boasting about himself. Ego can be easily handled if you respect yourself. Then you will not feel hurt. Because who can be insulting but yourself to yourself. Supposing there are some dogs barking at an elephant. He just, he goes on like that. Have you seen an elephant? Very interesting. He walks like this and he finds some dog barking, very nicely he puts them like that you see. Like a little child [unclear] his majesty. So huge that the dog is alright. He is not bothered as to how they treat him. They bark at him and he just walks. That's why we say that an elephant is a very dignified animal. It walks with dignity. A person like that doesn't take to cheap fashions and cheap things. He is in his own dignity. A person like that doesn't take to cheap fashions or things like that. He's in his own dignity. He does not try; he does not try to adjust himself to the norms of things that they have created. You cannot play into the hands of these bogus people, who say that your weight should be, I don't know how much? And your this thing should be so much. All the women trying to do that. Tomorrow they may come and say your hair should be so long. So you become like this so all the women trying to do that. You must wear wigs, so everybody is trying to wear wigs. You don't play into their hands anymore once you start respecting yourself.

Like in India, they started a fashion of sleeves you see. They started first from here, so much sleeves. They said so much sleeves, so much sleeves, then some said so much sleeves. And some said so much sleeves, you see it goes on. So somebody asked me what about you? I said I'm alright. From the very beginning, I'm going to happen that way only because it's too much to run this race. I cannot. Because I'm a tailor I have no time to waste for all this nonsense, why? What is the need? Whatever has been found out traditionally is accepted. And you will find all these fashions drop out just like that.

In our saris industry we have fashions coming. There were fashions of sari where they wanted to have a mini sari. You see whatever fashion [unclear]. You don't know what it is. It's very interesting. They used to have mini saris. The mini saris used to be only up to this point. They started going up to this point, you know. Some people tried to do it on all of them then they gave me. This is nothing this doesn't look nice. And it was started by a company because they wanted to sell more young, you see. By mini saris they could sell more young and charge the same for a sari because half sari and you sell it for a mini. Its only mini and money is double. [unclear] So the sari remains the same. Then they started printing on front part of the sari. It's the new fashion then another. I said nothing doing you better buy one traditional sari it lasts you all your life. It was sorted out. All these things fall off you see. Like you in Victorian times they must have worked out many things it falls off then something falls off. Something traditional that is there may not be useful to you but something eternally traditional will be there for you. And that is really traditional. Whichever falls off goes off people find new replace and that they are no good they throw it away.

Now when you think that you are doing, for example nowadays people are putting those hair. What they are putting pins inside the cheeks. They are putting them I've seen, putting them in nose, putting a pin here, putting a pin here. This is all will go you see after sometime you'll see putting something in their hair. Let them do it. They are foolish people but this is nothing. They can do something in a very subtle manner. You see like you already have. Because Elizabeth Queen had some problem with liver in the back so they started [unclear] so everybody started. At the time of Victoria she shared some sort of a problem at the back here. So she started wearing it so everybody started wearing it. For what? You have your attire, dress, sitting position. You are thinking itself is not fashion baggers. It is only fashion through your vibratory awareness.

Immediately if you read a book it comes on to the point and you see oh! It is not good but is this what truth is? Immediately you start studying the books you know which is the truth and which is not the truth because you don't read nonsense. Because you know its all falsehood all story telling you do not want to read something nonsensical. So you just understand the sense and the nonsense of it. So it works out. And that's how when you start respecting yourself. Respecting your thoughts, respecting your inspirations, your dreams, your aspirations, your visions. Write them down. Whatever thought you get write it down. Whatever inspiration you get, write it down. Whatever visions you think you should have for yourself, write it down, all that you think that should be the future, write it down. And pray for it. The greatest quality on this one is when you respect yourself when you respect yourself, you are respected, by whom? By the Gods, by the divine force, by all the angels. And whatever you want to do will be done, then it comes. Thy will be done! But that will has to come out of respect for yourself. If it is coming out of some other considerations.

For example now in Bombay, they want to have an ashram. People have all funny ideas about ashram. They want to have an ashram, why having this ashram. Some people are very clever I know all of them. Because they can make some money out of it. Foolish things as they are. Then some of them think that by staying there we can pass our old age very nicely. You see it will be a cheap thing, because Mataji is not going to charge anything for stuff, so it will be a nice cheap thing. Let's buy one. Some of them are thinking its very good place where in young age we can go there and it will be a good idea, we can runaway from work. We stay in the ashram and after all Sahaja Yoga won't be that hard work you see. So it will be nice living there. All these considerations when they are in the minds of the people you'll never get your ashram. Take it from me. We'll sleep till ten o'clock, who is going to wake us up? We'll do whatever we like in the ashram. We'll use it for our own purpose. We will not do any meditation. We will not do anything, whatsoever. We'll do no work at all. We will not help anything in the organizing of Sahaja Yoga or organizing people. We will not bring them. After all what will happen? You'll lose your vibrations.

If you respect yourself, expression of yourself must be respected. Tell your body to behave itself. Tell your mind to behave itself, and tell your emotions to behave itself. I've seen people hankering after a girlfriend or a boyfriend and asking for this and asking for that. And then coming to Me and telling, "Mother, what can I do about this girlfriend or a boyfriend... or some sort of a thing like that?" All these things are not going to help you. You have to respect yourself. You are an entity by yourself. You are not going to bow down to anyone. You are not going to accept anything. You are not going to accept anything that is not respectable for you. And this is how you are going to manage your rights.

Now the center part is very important in your seeking. In your seeking you have to know that you are seeking your spirit. You are seeking that your attention should now go to your spirit. You are not seeking the spirit but you are going to become one with the spirit. That is your seeking is. For that, it is very important to know about your all chakras. You must know how they are caught up and face up to it. You must face the truth. you have to be absolutely honest and truthful about it. That's the point in the center. If you are honest, the center point will work out. For example, I tell you, I cured a gentleman who was suffering from say, cancer. I cured him, alright. He's gone away and he didn't even write a letter of thanks. And if anybody asks him he says "Oh no, I'm still waiting." Four years passed, three years have passed. I'm still waiting for it. He wants to write in three months time. He has been dishonest to God. He should have told people "No, Mother has cured me." Then he gets back his cancer. And then he blames God for that. So truth must be accepted. You have to be truthful and honest for the central path, absolute on the truth. This is the truth we have found out, we have felt the vibrations. You are not feeling the vibrations or there is some mixture. Yes I'm catching on this. There are many people who say, "No Mother, I'm not catching". I know what is happening to them. They tell lies. Who are you telling lies?
