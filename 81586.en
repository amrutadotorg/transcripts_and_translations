 (England)
In Southall, it was the weekend of some weddings in London. This is a well-documented story of mine. We were living in the hotel in Bramham Gardens in Earl's Court. In those days, we had a housing collective in London, which I know Fergie is trying to resurrect. There was this guy who got hold of all these old properties that were up for redevelopment. He'd already gotten hold of one in Warwick Road, and there were a load of yogis living there. It was the first time I was going to live collectively with yogis.

The night before I moved in, he said, "I'm moving into this hotel." We were rattling around in this hotel for a couple of weeks, just the two of us with 20 bedrooms. Then Shri Mataji had to move out of her old house, and the new house in Brompton Square wasn't ready. She said, "I'm moving into the hotel." Of course, immediately, the hotel filled up.

Before Shri Mataji arrived, she had this weekend of weddings. We put up all the yogis who came from abroad in this hotel, and it was the first time I experienced having to cater for a large group of people. Anyway, they all turned up on the Friday night. We had a manic evening trying to produce food for 40 people and sorting everyone out, that sort of thing. The next morning, we got the message from Mother that all the brides were to go and stay at Chelsham Road that evening. All the grooms were to go off to Southall to buy curtains and pyjamas for the wedding.

Suddenly, the hotel was empty again. We were left there on our own, and I was twiddling my thumbs, wondering what I should do next—probably drifting off into the left a bit. Suddenly, the call went out: "Mother's here!" I thought, "Oh my God." We all rushed down into the foyer. Sure enough, it was Mother. Not only was it Mother, but there seemed to be a load of other yogis who'd suddenly come out of the woodwork. I don't know where from. Anyway, we were standing there. Mother had come to look over where she was going to stay when she moved in.

She said, "Oh, we couldn't find my car keys anywhere. We had to come over here by taxi. I need to go and do some shopping in Southall. Has anyone got a car?"

I was right at the back of this group of people. I heard this voice at the front saying, "Yes, Mother, Bernard's got a car."

I don't know whether you could actually call it a car. It was a rusty old Mini. You don't see them in this state these days. It had rust in the floor; you could see the road. It had plants growing along in the windows. It had no suspension—the suspension was completely shot. It was just a complete wreck.

I was hustled to the front. She said, "Oh, that'll do." I said, "What? You're sure you want to go in this car?" She said, "Yes." I said, "No problem. No problem."

We went out. I thought, "Oh my goodness, it was an absolute wreck, this car." Anyway, I opened the door, and Mother got in. We drove off. There was a big, so-harsh farewell as we drove off down the street. Then, when we got to Southall, what's the first thing we see? A big group of Sahaja Yogis walking along the street.

She said, "Oh, pull over, pull over!" I pulled over. Suddenly, the yogis all heard the car horn. These yogis looked up and said, "Oh, who's that? It's Shri Mataji!" They all crowded 'round the car. Of course, it being Southall, if there's a crowd, a crowd gathers. Suddenly, there was this huge, great crowd of people all gathered 'round the car. They're all sort of peering in, trying to see who or what was in the car.

Anyway, Shri Mataji gave some instructions to the yogis about where the best place was to go and buy some kurtas and stuff. She said, "Right, we've got to go off." We drove literally 40 yards up the road, parked the car, and got out. It was just me and Shri Mataji. We went into this sari shop. No crowd, just Shri Mataji and another Indian lady walking into this sari shop. There couldn't have been more of a contrast.

Afterwards, I remember we went to another sari shop. Mother said, "Oh, pull over." It was on a yellow line. I leapt out, opening the door for Mother. This bus stopped, and the driver started swearing his head off at me. I thought, "He can't do this. I'm with the Adi Shakti!" Anyway, Mother said, "Oh, you'd better go and park the car." I went off and parked the car.

Then on the way back, I apologised for the suspension of the car because it was very bumpy. Mother said, "Oh, I don't feel anything. It's just like being on a cloud." Well, I certainly felt I was on a cloud.

Yes, I was going to ask, how did it feel driving Mother?
