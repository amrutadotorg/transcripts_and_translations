Conversation with Sahaja Yogis. Kegelgasse, (Edith's house), Vienna (Austria), 3 September 1983.

Shri Mataji: A great Sahaja Yogi has come. He's a great Sahaja Yogi.

Gregoire: Would you like a cup of tea, Mother?

Shri Mataji: No, water. Actually, you said you'll introduce them to Me.

Gregoire: Should I do it now, Mother?

Shri Mataji: Yes, please.

Gregoire: So, this is Edith.

Shri Mataji: I know, I know.

Gregoire: We are in her house. Then we have among the Sahaja Yogis, who have been quite active. When I say your name please get up, so that is the easiest thing. We have Herbert, we have Guenter, we have Zorana, Inge, Engelbart.

Shri Mataji: I don't know this one. (Laughter)

Gregoire: Jacqueline, Thomas; he is the brother of Guenter.

Shri Mataji: Oh, I see.

Gregoire: Camillo.

Shri Mataji: He is also from Spain or something.

Gregoire: No, he is from Austria.

Shri Mataji: Austria? (Laughter) More Spanish sound.

Gregoire: Then you have Hamid that You have met.

Shri Mataji: Yes, of course, he is around us.

Gregoire: And Wolfgang, Dorothea, Elisabeth, another Elisabeth, Sissi. What is the first name of your friend? Werner. I forget him, Werner. I certainly forgot. Oh, Monica, I forgot Monica.

Shri Mataji: And the lady there sitting, the elder lady?

Gregoire: The elder lady is the mother of Zorana. She is the mother of Zorana, she comes from Ljubljana. She just came for the children.

Shri Mataji: Zorana. Oh, I see.

Gregoire: She is a pediatrist.

Shri Mataji: I see.

Gregoire: And from Yugoslavia also. Islia.

Shri Mataji: In the corner?

Gregoire: Where is she, Islia? And the lady in the corner is also an Edith, but she came three days ago. So, she is quite welcome. And who did I forget? Edwin, I said ah. Edwin, Edwin, Edwin, sorry.

Shri Mataji: Of course. You were the first whom I met.

Gregoire: And Gilde, Gilde. I said - whom did I forget - he said.

Shri Mataji: Gilde.

Gregoire: Herminegilde is her name. Mother, you won't recognize her, but one year ago she said, "Dont be a crying baby."

Shri Mataji: She said to Me?

Gregoire: No, (laughter) You said to her. And Mother, also I forgot of course Djamel Beruqua, from Algeria.

Shri Mataji: I remember. May God bless you, may God bless you! Yeah. We are getting Algerians everywhere, you see. [Unsure]

And yes, the last was in Mulhouse, a gentleman called George. He is the journalist, and he brought a gentleman who is a director of broadcasting with him for the radio program and he interviewed Me, and I felt that he could be something else but French. But he kept quiet. Then he said that he is Algerian. I said, "All right, let's start and throw vibrations". And he readily accepted it. And he got his Realization too.

Gregoire: Then this economist, Mother, who had problems with the eyes, Bea Shenu or something like that. He also came with his wife in Paris.

Shri Mataji: Yeah, he came. Then there was one Haji who came, then of course we have these [journalists ?] there so many, but Algeria is the first I think which is doing well in Sahaja Yoga among all the Muslim countries, but Tunisia is second. Tunisia is a free country. Not that they are not free, but these are more sort of a little controlled, isnt it? The government is very controlling there. That's why I can't go. Otherwise, I would have gone to Algeria.

Gregoire: Do you have the songs? Did you take the songs with you? The German ones.

Shri Mataji: Take out your shoes, tell him.

Gregoire: I am sorry.

Shri Mataji: No, no let him, let him do it.

Gregoire: Take out your shoes Matt, take out your shoes.

Shri Mataji: Good. Pretty warm also for him. So - better like that. Itis nice that it is these days it is quite warm in those countries so people are really getting relief from the over clogging of clothes this that. Open the windows. All right.

Gregoire: That's the wrong one. Hamid, how many do you have in your car? About 25.

Shri Mataji: You came with the?

Yogini: [Patrick and Gerti]

Shri Mataji: Oh you came by car? Oh I see.

Gregoire: Yes, this year I took a car.

Shri Mataji: Ah that's good. I thought you came with [Dhumal ?]. [Hindi]

Gregoire: So Mother, we have one rehearsal. With Your permission we would like to sing something, because we have the Italian singing, and we all are very jealous because they sing so beautifully. (Laughter) So we are not singing beautifully, but well try this one because its in German, and it is high time we sing something in German. So please Inge. The meanings are: Come, oh come you comforter, come in my heart, oh Spirit from above, open my wisdom so that I can understand the counsel of God. Its to the Holy Spirit.

Shri Mataji: Oh, I see. Take out your shoe. Another poor fellow, better.

Gregoire: Poor fellow, has been struggling with his shoes.

Shri Mataji: It's all right. You come and sit here, come and sit here, come along

Gregoire: First, Inge will sing, then all the girls, then all of us.

Gregoire: Bolo Shri Jaganmata Shri Adi Shakti Bhagawati Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi Ki Jay!

Shri Mataji: Beautiful. Written so well, who has written it?

Gregoire: Oh, that was done by seekers before us Mother. (Laughter) 1674. Tomorrow we will have an old one. Tomorrow we will have one that we have done ourselves.

Shri Mataji: Ah good, but this one he says 'Councillor'.

Gregoire: Yes, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Does he?

Gregoire: This is from 1647.

Shri Mataji: So, he says that, Councillor?

Gregoire: Should I tell You the [poem]? Oh come, oh come my Comforter, come in my heart, oh Spirit from above, blow your wisdom so that we seek God alone. Come, oh come my Councillor. We pray for understanding and light so that we can understand the word of God.

Shri Mataji: See.

Gregoire: Come, oh come my Comforter, assist us with Thy counsel, so that we go on the right path. Come, oh come, oh my Comforter in our heart, so that you make us strong in difficulties and anoint us with steadiness.

Shri Mataji: See. (Laughter) You see this is the first time I am hearing something sensible like that. (Laughter) Because they never talked of the Councillor or of Comforter or asking for it, nothing. Its so clearly said - sustenance.

Gregoire: Come oh come, oh my Comforter in my heart, oh Spirit from above, give us the holy science from the source of strength of faith.

Shri Mataji: Just see.

Gregoire: Come, oh come my Comforter, come in my heart, oh Spirit from above, enlighten our love, so that we can become absolutely Divine.

Shri Mataji: It's great. I think you should sing it in the beginning of the program.

Gregoire: Tomorrow - of the Puja?

Shri Mataji: Program - no, no, in the program. Yes, good idea, you see. Its a very good idea. I think this should be the national anthem for the Sahaja Yogis of Austria. It's so wonderful, I mean, it's so suggestive, I mean nowhere I have seen this, so clearly.

Sahaja Yogi: Fear of the Divine.

Gregoire: Meeting in us the awe of the Divine.

Shri Mataji: Oh. So what should we do? What work should the Councillor do? (Laughter)

Gregoire: I think, have a cup of tea, Mother.

Shri Mataji: No, you can have many forces, anti-God forces, that - isnt it?

Sahaja Yogini: The meaning is so many people think they are stronger than Heaven. May we be humble enough and have fear enough of God because nobody is stronger than Heaven. Only many people think they are stronger than Heaven.

Shri Mataji: Such a great thing it is.

Gregoire: We sing a short one.

Shri Mataji: Because there are so many here already, in Austria.

Song in German:
"Nun danket all und bringet Ehr,
Ihr Menschen in der Welt,
Dem dessen Lob der Engel Heer
Im Himmel stets vermeldt!

Ermuntert euch und singt mit Schall
Gott, unserm hoechsten Gut,
Der seine Wunder ueberall
Und grosse Dinge tut,

Er gebe uns ein froehlich Herz,
Erfrische Geist und Sinn
Und werf all Angst, Furcht, Sorg und Schmerz
Ins Meeres Tiefe hin."

Sahaja Yogis: Om twamewa sakshat Shri Ganesha sakshat Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi namoh namaha.

Shri Mataji: Beautiful! Germans are known for their music - Mozart, this, that, I mean. The first opera I heard was in Germany. East Berlin. In West Berlin, I heard musical concert, but opera was in East Berlin first one was, while Mozart only, this magic flute or something.

Gregoire: Yes, Mother, would you like to....

Shri Mataji: Hear Mozart?

Gregoire: May be this time, Engelbert, can you see something from Mozart is going? But we have public programs every evening and its in the evening, usually.

Shri Mataji: No, no, anytime. If you find it, otherwise, forget it. I will take a record or something. (Laughter) When we were coming youll be surprised when we got into the plane they played a Mozart at the background and in front some sort of a dhau dhau dhau going on. But if you dont listen to the modern stuff the Mozart was playing at the back.

Come in all, theres a lot of room, you come forward, they can also come in the same room.

Gregoire: Camillo, Hamid, come in the front. Mother, I have to go to the airport, I am sorry.

Shri Mataji: It's all right, go. But she can translate or somebody - German.

Gregoire: Zorana, can you translate? Ok.

Shri Mataji: Come here.

Gregoire: Come, come here, sit here.

Shri Mataji: Are you taking this gentleman to the airport?

Gregoire: I dont think I can take him with me, Mother.

Shri Mataji: All right, you stay. Daddy going to office? That they understand. I think he'll sleep off now.

Shri Mataji: Im very happy to come back to Austria, to Vienna. Also, I'm really so much surprised that in Vienna we have such good Sahaja Yogis and so many of them in such a short time. The whole thing shows that where we expect nothing as such - Austria I was thinking would be very much war torn and unhappy place, and people will be now go on the materialistic trip. But there I find the seekers so many of them, so its surprising. And the greatest thing is that Austria is a center of so many things here, you had cultural thing, known for its music, apart from that sort of points, the other part of Europe - the rest of it in such a way - actually it is very close to Russian border side you can say. So, the whole of that continent is like a bridge in between - Austria is. And bridge is always a weaker thing than the streets - the roads are, but I find the bridge is stronger than roads. (Shri Mataji laughing)

So, it is also another surprise for Me, because I had met in the UN with My husband many Austrians, and I found them extremely shallow people. And I thought that they are more interested in all this kind of jokes of international organizations. (Laughter) I never expected they would be really so deep as to look at the whole world from a deeper angle that it requires the enlightenment. And on these grounds to find such a surprise of beautiful seekers is really a very great present to the Divine, I think.

Now we have to understand that Sahaja Yoga is a very different style of spiritual fulfilment. Only this time after Guru Puja I have started telling all the Sahaja Yogis how this fulfilment is so enriching, nourishing, and completing the whole understanding. The thing is, so far human beings have evolved either by physical process or by emotional process or by mental process. Now these are the work of the elements which are like the physical process when takes place uses the oxygen, or air element. And the emotional process also you use more of water element for that. And for your mental process you use the ether. So the human beings have grown on these three, four elements. And the light also, we have used quite a lot to see through our eyes and all that. Light we have used - like from the sun. All these elements we have used and we - actually even when we have not used they have manifested their blessings on us.

Now the last and the most important is the Mother Earth. She has to manifest Her own way to give a new dimension to our consciousness. So the consciousness of a human being has been of a certain level so far with the boons of these other elements but the Mother Earth. I mean to say whatever you have to take from the Mother Earth you have to put in an effort and extract it from Her. It is not that She spontaneously has put into you something in your consciousness. Means whatever we have tried to get from the Mother Earth has been a gross taking in of Her qualities, or taking in Her manifestations, but actually She Herself has not manifested upon us. She has not added to our consciousness. Now say for example, if we eat a fruit from the Mother Earth we dont develop any consciousness out of it. But supposing, you see, we have to understand it in this way that whatever Mother Earth has given us actually we have snatched it from Her, we have dug it out ourselves, we have absorbed it by our efforts, not spontaneously. But we breathe spontaneously, we breathe spontaneously. When we are emotionally disturbed we breathe spontaneously. So one must understand that so far we have not been able to manifest the Mother Earth within us. So in this new consciousness the Mother Earth is going to manifest. Like a tree has grown outside with all these elements supporting it, but it has not gone to its source on which it is living.

Now, the subtle side of Mother Earth is the Kundalini. She is expressed within us as Kundalini. And when she manifests, she is the one who nourishes us - like the womb of the mother. She nourishes us and she makes us grow. She guides us, but her subtle side has not yet been manifested in our being. Only when the Kundalini awakens, her subtle side starts manifesting.

This is the Age of Aquarius. And this is the time - is the time that represents the Kundalini. Aquarius is represented as Kundalini. They call it in Sanskrit language 'Kumbha'. So this power is the power of Aquarius which nourishes, which gives you satisfaction. But the job of the other four elements is to make you more outward, extrovert, manly. Thats how when people saw the sea they wanted to cross it, overcome it, and go and attack other people. So the height of human evolution if it is, we can say Christ was, He was a complete man with the subtle qualities of a woman - that is compassion and love. The Christ, you see is the height of manliness with compassion which are the qualities of women. Like for Him, He said, "I will use the instrument of forgiveness," which is an instrument of women - Mother. So the fathers job is to develop a person outside, if he say - then the mothers job is to nourish. So this is a different role altogether which one must first understand. And without each other they cannot perform a complete duty. They cannot perform a complete duty.

It's all right. Now, these days we find that there is a feminist nonsense coming out. (Laughter) Now feminism is very misdirected consciousness of a woman. Because a woman tries to become a man - is not the way. We already have men, so we dont want more men. (Laughter) And it would be like a pendulum - a woman was here and she becomes man, man becomes a woman, woman becomes a man, and its like a pendulum movement. But the consciousness has to rise in a spiral way at a higher level. Not in a pendulous way that you move from this end to that end. So it has to go higher than what it was before in a spiral. So then one has to understand that if anything has to happen to our consciousness which is important, we have to be at a higher point than where we are. So to trigger that point Kundalini is there, and She pushes you at a higher consciousness by nourishing you to the consciousness of the Spirit.

Now we must understand that before this Kundalini Yoga that started, all the concept of God was created mentally on the ethereal level by all the great prophets to do the job of preparing an image, first of all. And now the Kundalini itself by its manifestation introduces you to the reality of them. She actualizes them, all of them, all these principles of God and the Spirit. So actually now you are introduced. First like you will tell your friends, "Now Mataji is going to come, She is such and such, She is like this that," still it is a mental conception. Now, but when I come here its a different thing altogether. Now its an actual thing I am before you. So the Kundalini introduces you to actuality, to reality. All those mental pictures that we had get completely actualized by Kundalini awakening. So all these projections were created for us to be prepared for this last bit of jump by which we would be able to tell you. Like if they had not told you, "Mataji is such and such," you would not recognize Me and My work. And moreover you would not have been prepared for Me. For example, Gregoires wife must have telephoned to you that I was coming here, so you went downstairs to receive Me. (Shri Mataji laughing)

So thats the reason why these people all of them created a proper mental picture for you. All the prophets and all the people incarnations they created a proper picture for you to understand that you have to become this, you will become this, this is God, this is Spirit, this is the Son. And they said, "The Holy Ghost, the Mother has to be kept a mystery for the time being." Because when you have a surprise, as I had a surprise in Vienna, the joy would be greater. (Laughter)

So this is how it was beautifully arranged. But human beings in their own understanding thought that whatever mental projection is given, if they just start writing about it and talking about it they have achieved it. Like as many times I have told you that if a car is given to you they give you the key also with it and say that, "Let the car start then everything will start moving." But supposing, you see, if you have the car and not the key, then you start moving the wheel, moving everything, but the car doesnt move. But you have to be satisfied with yourself so you say, "Yes it moved, you see." (Laughter) Its a mental faith.

So now what to do with this kind of an attitude that people have developed? That without getting the reality they wanted to believe in something that has not yet started. So the whole thing looks like a myth then. They should have waited for the key to come in and the car to be started, actually. But in their myth they built all the big, big places, big, big organizations, so many dead dogmas to fight each other that when you come on this earth you just dont understand what has happened. (Laughter)

So you get a surprise which is shocking, not of joy. And this is what it is, at this juncture when you see around with Me so many others have come here who have been doing this kind of stuff all their lives, you see those who are in charge of doing all this mythical stuff. They are here with Me standing with Me only.

( Part 2: )

False gurus standing here with Me now at this time. But in a plastic flower - you put even one real flower, you see you can make it out. But if somebody is not very sensitive he might think all the flowers are real, inclusive of the also real one and the unreal ones. And another might say that all of them are unreal. Only those who are gifted with discretion will immediately say, "No, this one flower is real, the rest are plastic." So first few years of any establishment of Sahaja Yoga you have to get those few who have got the discretion. It is not how many people you get for the program important. It is how many you get for Sahaja Yoga is important. Like a fisherman, you see, puts his thing in the water and gets a heavy load of fishes, and all are dead fishes and smelling ones except for one living. So he doesnt know what to say, he is quite upset and he throws all of them back. So we should all pray that we should get living fishes, alert fishes, who have got discretion for our program as many as possible. And that is how it will work out.

Now, for the Sahaja Yogis who are here, who are already Sahaja Yogis, they have to know that the more they give Realization the better they will improve inside. First there will be all the problems of the past life. Like a little chick is born out of the egg, it carries a little smell of the egg on the body. But the mother then cleanses them and clears them out and your Kundalini looks after you, then youll become pure personalities and you can spread your wings to fly. So in the beginning we come from a competitive world so all the problems of competitive world little bit crawl with you. We can say like people try to pull each other - it can be jealousies or there could be heart burnings and there could be little bit setbacks, doesnt matter. But as you develop your responsibility and as you understand that now youve got free wings to fly out, then you understand that many birds have to put together to lift this world from this dangerous ignorance. So we have to listen what others have to say, we have to develop a rapport between each other, and a very loving care should be there between Sahaja Yogis. Because all of you put together have to do this job. If I could alone do it, I would not have requested you to be Sahaja Yogis. You are My hands and you are My eyes. And its only through your help Sahaja Yoga can be manifested and we can save the whole world. Of course I am here to give you all the counsel, all the comfort, all the redemption, all that you want I am here to give you. All My help, all My counsel, My redemption, My comfort I am here to give you.

So. Now, for you it is necessary to allow it to grow. The attention will have better light if you take out your attention from other small things. And watch your own growth, face yourself. And youll be amazed then you can do wonders with your own growth. Of course these three days Im going to start on this topic and this country is very manly, because of the German influence also and Germans are all very manly. They dont even call there country motherland but a fatherland. (Laughter) But if you understand the complimentary nature of these two principles then you will not feel anyway hurt, because one is the one that manifests outside, the another one that nourishes it. Manifests outside and the one that nourishes it. You said it. So one has not to have any conflict or inferiority or a superiority complex, these are all artificial things. And it is something to be accepted, because thats the reality is, and its so beautiful. And at this point of our evolution even otherwise we want to have a human being not so aggressive, not so docile, but gifted with the capacity of compassion. At this time of evolution now we have to understand that as the world is today we do not worship people or we do not call them heroes who are aggressive, but the person, the man who has got the great capacity of compassion. But of course it should not be confused with docile men, or passive men, it does not mean that. But crowned by the completion of their character as the compassionate man. So this is how the new understanding of consciousness must move that new consciousness is a consciousness which has actualized the compassion.

For example, in Sahaja Yoga, I don't do anything but the compassion works, you see. You also dont do anything, you just raise the hand like this and that what flows works, manifests, actualizes. So this is what it is, like we can say the candle has been prepared, made ready by the manliness side, and now enlightened by the Kundalini - so both are complimentary. If you do not have the candle what will you light? So first the candle had to be made.

Because always people say that, "Then why not first God gave Realization to everyone who was born from the very beginning?" (Laughter) Also that was tried. It was tried for Adam and Eve, but they made all the mistake. Thats the original sin. But that was the original sin human beings committed that they wanted to have their own way. So they developed into the candle without the light. They were developed into the candle without the light. And now the light has to go there. Does the candle feel inferior or is the candle inferior, because the light is on the crown? Should the man feel inferior that the compassion is in the crown? On the contrary it has no purpose - then it is purposeless to have a candle if you cannot have a light. And if you do not have the candle whats the use having light? What will you do with the light?

It is so complimentary, it is so important, it is only thing that the purpose of the whole thing is that this mental attitude of men and women is all absurd. Its so complimentary that this mental projection of men and women is absolutely absurd. So it has gone up to such absurdity that they talked of the Father, of the Son and not of the Mother. You cant get a father and a son without a mother, can you? (Shri Mataji laughing) Have you ever seen any man producing a son? (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter) So this is what it is more in the West. So we have to fight this deviation, that's all. Basically its just the same everywhere that they know this was the truth, this is the truth, this will be the truth. And once we understand that the truth is now you are not bothered.

In the book of Essenes, if you read the Bible was described in the olden days, was the earliest Bible they write all these things. They write about Mother as the Holy Ghost. But now you see, now we have become so mentally absorbed that for us mental projection is everything. But Im sure Sahaja Yogis will understand this subtle point and theyll be able to use it to convince others.

Especially, it is very important for Sahaja Yoginis to understand their role - not as a man but as the Kundalini, the one that nourishes, that bears, like the Mother Earth. Because she is so powerful! She bears all this because she is so powerful! And the whole thing will look so beautiful, the whole picture, that people will see a complete human being as a woman, as a man. For the woman has to realize that she has to nourish the whole world, she has to bear their nonsense, she is the one who is the support, she is the one who gives them gravity - the dignity, the gravity. And the men have to realize that they have to be compassionate, and affectionate, and kind. And then you will find it's a beautiful Sahaja Yoga unit or you can say a universe.

All right, so on these lines, I am going to speak this time. I hope the Germans will swallow it. (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter) Thank you, thank you everyone!

You should have the lunch and then I can rest for a while, because there is another interview.

Yogi: Mother, is the interview here or is it?

Shri Mataji: In there, so thats why Im saying.

Yogi: At Gregoires. So You will rest here or at Gregoires?

Shri Mataji: No, I rest there and it will be better. So if you can serve the lunch then immediately as soon as Gregoire comes here I may go. Or is there a place where I can rest here, where I could?

Yogis: Yes, there is.

Shri Mataji: Good. I will rest here. Will be better.

All right?

Yogi: Mother, also the left Vishuddhi becomes better, when this relationship between.

Shri Mataji: Of course very much, yes very much. And it is such a funny thing this left Vishuddhi, I must tell you. (Laughter) There was a lady who came to Me with her husband who might become very unhappy when she had come to Sahaja Yoga. Because her husband was carrying on with another woman, doing with another woman and saying - he had told her that he was very guilty about it, but he cannot help it, and like that. So she came to Me. Come here, can you translate it?

Yes, there was a gentleman and a lady who came to Me and the lady was very unhappy because she told Me that he was carrying on with another woman and he always said that, yes he is feeling very guilty about it and this and that, you see. So she was very unhappy and she came to Sahaja Yoga and she got her Realization. So he didnt come first time, he came recently but she improved in Sahaja Yoga, she felt very much better and she started facing life better. And he used to again come back to her and again go back to another woman and he was like this throughout. He was like this moving from one woman to another woman, you see and. No, no, no - he. She came to Sahaja Yoga and improved, but he was still just the same. (Laughter) What did he translate? (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter)

Hes good, hes good, he knows it, all right. So you see he gets confused because he is a bachelor. He gets confused. (Shri Mataji laughing & laugher)

All right so you see, he told Me when he came to see Me - just see the stupidity of the left Vishuddhi. He said, "I feel very guilty, I am like this, oh I cant help it, I feel very guilty about it, I love her, I dont want to hurt her." No, no, no, you have to translate in German, you are talking in English. (Laughter)

No, no, no, no, German, you say in German. Is it, is it German he says? (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter)

Goes on like that you see that, "I know I should not do like this, I know I am doing wrong but I am in love with my wife and if I have hurt her, I am sorry." Just imagine - what a drama. So I said, "If you are guilty then you must be punished." (Laughter) He was shocked. (Shri Mataji laughing) He thought that if he declared he was guilty that was sufficient. He thought if he just said, "I am guilty," that was sufficient.

Aside: No, no, its all right, you are doing it well, you see. You say in German that He said, you see these things to Me and he thought that if you say you are guilty then you can get away with any guilt, get away with any sin.

Aside: Margret should do it.

You see. Now, so I told him that you must go for a punishment otherwise how will you justify your guilt? So he said, "What sort of punishment?" I said, "You do not eat your food for eight days. (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter) And go to your office walking - not in your car, and dont wear your suits, and dont try to look a smart man. Dont sign any checks, give all your checkbooks to your wife." The lady left him and ran away. Thats how the guilt can be taken out by punishment. So those who think they are guilty should punish themselves. This is a new advancement in Sahaja Yoga. (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter) Like Ill tell you another thing, (Shri Mataji laughing) little, little punishments like that can help a person. (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter)

Ha, I will tell you about cigarettes, when they smoke cigarettes they feel guilty and then they again smoke cigarettes, okay? So what My father did to one of his friends he said, "You can break the circle." He said, "How?" He said, "Before starting to smoke you just burn your hand." For some time hell get the pain, "And then when again you feel like smoking again burn your hand."

Like in Switzerland its very common, its very fashionable to say that, "I feel very guilty because the people in Cambodia are very poor." Cambodia, in some place farfetched place. I mean I said, "You have no solution for it. Why are you feeling guilty? I mean, you are not doing it. So why are you guilty? All right, you can send all your money to Cambodia and you will be rid of your guilt." Thats it. So then - you see this is we are cheating ourselves. Intelligence has a capacity to cheat itself.

Aside: Loudly.

This is what intelligence is - it cheats itself. And you feel quite satisfied with it - with that cheating. So one must understand that this intelligence is not your self - this is the cheater. He is keeping you out of the source of joy. But pure intelligence will take you down there, yes, pure intelligence. Thats what it is. Because it comes from the Spirit, from the innocence, from the innocence. And the other comes from cunningness.

Thank you very much now! So no more guilt also, finished. (Laughter) Otherwise youll be punished. (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter) Who arent like that?

My father did that once and the fellow gave up smoking. You see, its very simple, you better punish.

Yogi: Its a great idea.

Shri Mataji: But it could be also with some people, you know they like to torture themselves also. So for them the punishment should be the other way round, you see. Like a child who wants to scratch his nose all the time they tie up his hands, you see with something like that. See, its a funny world and funny human beings. They want to destroy themselves. (Laughter) Cant understand.

Yogi: I remember, Mother, I said I never feel guilty, I never feel guilty. I was with you in Hong Kong and I kept saying to everybody I dont know what this guilt business is. I never feel guilty, ever. And Shri Mataji said nothing to me, but She let me take vibrations from Her left Vishuddhi one night. And for three days I was in the hospital with acute tonsillitis. (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter)

Shri Mataji: Thats the punishment. (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter) You see, Indians never feel guilty. I tell you - never. You tell them do not do like this, you shouldnt do like this. They will never feel that they have done anything wrong, again they will do it. They never feel guilty - so this is even worse, I think not to listen to anyone. Is arrogance, is arrogance and what should we say. [Adamance] is there and boasting as you said. Its boasting and they say, "Oh its all right," anything they will do. Tell them, "All right, whatever done is done." Indians are typically like that. Its very bad, I dont understand. But here they reconcile with themselves by saying, "I am guilty - finished." That certificate they have, say, "I am guilty - finished." Both ways its just the same. Indians, you know, one of them robbed Me when I was in Puna, a very funny man. He came to Me and I told him that, "This is too much money you have robbed Me now." So he said, "I know Ive done it, what to do? You see, this happened, that happened and after all Im a poor man. I felt like making money - so what?" "Its a wonderful person," I said, "but why out of Me?" He said, "I had only this chance to make money out of You, so I made it, so what?" I said, "All right." Next time he had another punishment, (Shri Mataji laughing) so thats how it is. [Hindi]

Its impossible to hear such a man. Hell always say an explanation. Indian will have always an explanation, "Oh this." Or hell divert, you see, if you are talking to him that, "You should not have done this," he is very cunning, Indians are very clever people. So they will start another topic so that your attention is diverted. (Laughter) But theyll never see that they have done something wrong and they should correct it, never. Thats typical.

So we have two types of people also. I think the people who are developing - still so called developing people do not feel the guilt. Those who are developed feel the guilt. I mean they use the guilt and these people use the - what you call the kind of a barrier, "Oh whats wrong, you see, Ive done nothing wrong," thats it. Western people are more sensitive that way to develop a guilt about things but then becomes a lump in here, the Kundalini does not rise. Whether it is here or here, for the Kundalini rising both should dissolve.

You follow English all of you, I think? Who does not follow English among all of you? You better translate this. At all. Absolute.

I cant learn so many languages, (Laughter) but German I may be able to learn. I think its quite closer. But this French (Laughter) is something I just dont understand. You have to say every word away. I mean simple thing was daisy. So they said daisy is 'marguerite'. So all right, now daisy is marguerite now. What is John - is Jean. [What is George - is Jean] Why not say George?

Yogi: Mother, please say something in German.

Shri Mataji: What did he say?

Yogi: They want you to say something in German.

Shri Mataji: German, My one - first German experience I must tell you. (Laughter)

Is the lunch ready? Its getting ready. Lunch is getting ready? Still time.

Its a very funny experience I had first when I came to Germany to Hamburg, and then we went to a place called Bremen. And there was a German fellow. Please translate this much.

And in Bremen this fellow came to see Me, and he saw Me and he said you see that his mother was Indian or grandmother - somebody was Indian, so now he called Me Mother. I said, "Very good idea." And he knew English very well and on the shipping people know English. I mean, its more - maritime is more a English sort of a thing so everyone knows English, no problem. And you better translate that, he is good. (Laughter)

Now this gentleman you see, we went to a place called Bremen where there is a very nice cathedral. So you translate it is better, because its very sweet thing and you should not miss the point. (Laughter)

And in that cathedral in the basement you see they said that, "There are lots of mummies - natural mummies." They said that, "When this cathedral was built one child fell down and died. And they found that the child was still living in the sense that there was no smell coming out of the body, you see, sort of decaying was not there." So must be the vibrations there. So the people paid money and put their bodies in that vault after death. They paid money after death to be put their bodies in the vault. And there were lots of mummies.

So, this son of Mine, who took Me down, I had My two daughters and My nephew with Me, we all went in that place to see the church, the cathedral. And then they told us that, "The mummies are there. Would you like to go and see?" So My both the daughters said, "Nothing doing, we are going to sit down here, we dont want to see any mummies." (Laughter) Honorably they retreated. (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter) Now, this gentleman said, "What is there to be afraid of see, look at me, you see I am not afraid, we are Germans, we are not afraid." (Laughter) So we said, "All right, come along, lets go." This nephew of Mine was little frightened, you know so he was running away. (Shri Mataji laughing) He was holding on to My sari. He tugged him around and said, "You Indians are such cowards, come along." (Shri Mataji laughing) And when we went in, you see the fellow was the guide was telling us something in German, "Ischt, nischt, bischt, krischt." (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter) And My nephew was just, you see tugging on to Me, because he could not bear to see those dead bodies. It was horrible looking - absolutely. (Shri Mataji laughing) Because it was just bones and - its horrible bones and skin, Ive never seen such a sight. But I was just trying to feel the vibrations there, thats all. I was not disturbed at all. But this great German you see, when he saw this you know his face changed, (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter) and he was walking very fast with Me enter, but then he started walking, you know with pressing both the legs together. I said, "What is the matter?" I did not know what was happening. So he went and told the gentleman who was guiding with the big stick, you see, something in his ears. (Shri Mataji laughing) And that person threw that indicator, you see and got hold of him and took him back, took him away and both of them talking in German, "Stock, stock, stock." And I said, "What has happened?" And he rushed...

( Part 3: )

Yogi translator: [Two daughters were sitting outside on the benches.]

Shri Mataji: They saw him rushing past there. (Laughter) They said, "Where are you going?" In a very awkward running pose, you see. In a very awkward running pose, running condition, awkward. So they asked, "Where are you going?" He said, "I am going to the toilet." (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter) But you see, first he said it in only German. And they couldnt understand. He forgot English also. So this is the first introduction to German. (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter & applause)

I had seen pictures of, you see Germany and German people, and I said, "Now what sort of Germans these are; now poor things, you know, he was such a sweet man he was though." Because inside of every human being there is a sense, you see that after death this is whats going to happen to me, you see. And it really makes you frightened. One may be brave or anything but when you see that actually the whole thing fizzles out. But the other reality is of your Spirit, is so beautifying. That you feel so sure of yourself and so secure. That you do not aggress on anyone or you do not take aggression, you are not frightened, nor you frighten others. This is what it is, whether you aggress or take aggression is the same. Result of the same insecurity. If you are secure then you dont aggress or you dont take any aggression.

So if any of you have any chance sometimes to go to Bremen, please have a look at there. (Laughter) Do you ever go to West Germany?

Yogi: To make programs?

Shri Mataji: To make - Bremen is the best place for making program, very sensitive people.

Yogi: Where?

Shri Mataji: Bremen.

Yogi: Thats where Barbara comes from Mother. Barbaras home is Bremen.

Shri Mataji: Really. You have to go there. You see, to understand about vibrations, I mean the Divinity part of it is also remarkable, isnt it? And that place has vibrations. Thats a good idea. I didnt know. Then let her go to Bremen.

Yogi: That was one of the places you put your feet to Mother - Bremen, Munich, and Freiburg.

Shri Mataji: Freiburg? But what about Im going to Hamburg, to Bremen?

Yogi: And Hamburg, I beg your pardon.

Shri Mataji: Hamburg is -

Yogi: Its a very sinful city.

Shri Mataji: Hamburg yeah. Hamburg is like London, same style, Hamburg is like London already. Now, the same style, means a very materialistic, very business like, all the dirt and filth of everything there. Hamburg, but Bremen is very sweet. Beautiful place, Bremen. What is it? I can go there or you [want]? But the worst thing that I have heard about Germany now that Rajneesh is going down there. Freiburg and all these places, you see. Because Rajneesh has now been ousted also from America, because he cant speak. Just translate it.

And Americans say the law is that if you have some special capacity or special talent then they give you - what you call a citizenship. But this fellow, the one who has gone there cannot speak at all much, and cannot give speeches. Some say he is paralyzed, some say, but some say, I mean more say that he is a person who is an impostor. And the real Rajneesh is already killed in India. So now, this fellow, the new fellow is not the real Rajneesh. But the American authorities say that, "If he cannot teach then we cant have him here." So he will be very soon ousted from there and may come down to Germany. He was about to go to Australia, but I think Australia is now neutralized. So we have to work out in Germany about it. There is a private film about Rajneesh, The God who ran away.

Yogi: Gregoire has arrived, Mother.

Shri Mataji: He has come. [Hindi] Hello, may God bless you! If you could, come along, come along.

If you could see the film and publish it, because you see this film was later on purchased by Rajneesh and cannot be shown in public. But if some of the journalists can see it, they can write. Can they? Then it can be worked out.

Yogi: Its copyright Mother, so it cannot be shown in public.

Shri Mataji: No, no, no, privately.

Yogi: But it may be shown quite easily - privately.

Shri Mataji: You see, and let the people, who see - then write, "That we saw it privately."

Yogini: What is this movie all about?

Shri Mataji: About Rajneesh. All right. And then you should write like that about Rajneesh, to the judge it could be shown this privately, if there is any case. You can consult some lawyers about it. Well get you the film. All taken secretly, horrible! We can ask somebody to get you that one. Gregoire, did you follow My account?

Gregoire: Yes Mother, I did.

Shri Mataji: (aside) Made especially for Me? There was no need. I can eat whatever they have cooked for Me.

Was a trick. No, no, it is all right. What is the thing like that and what is the trick [about the trick.]

Gregoire: The trick is that we should try to sell the film to them and get money out of it. (Laughter)

Shri Mataji: Of course, everyone of them. But can tell what happened about Rajneesh in Australia, Warren can tell.

Yogi: We have two journalists, who are Sahaja Yogis in Australia. And they wrote particularly about Rajneesh and the other gurus.

Shri Mataji: Great, this is a German solution I think, isnt it? I have said many a times if the Germans take to Sahaja Yoga solutions will come, no doubt. Theyll solve the problems, I am sure, with all their dynamism. They will solve the problem, I have no doubts about it. So tell them.

Now you better translate him too. (Laughter)

Gregoire: I can do that, Mother. I said each people, each folk has a specific quality and here we dont speak about Austria or Germany, but generally those of the German world - if they can enter into Sahaja Yoga then their qualities will -

Shri Mataji: Adopt.

Gregoire: Be of great benefit to the whole.

Shri Mataji: Very much. And of that I am sure.

Gregoire: Thank you, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Of that I am sure. I am really sure. But he cant tell you what happened about Rajneesh, I tell you.

Yogi: Gregoire you know, the story, that Shri Mataji mentioned.

Shri Mataji: You better tell.

Yogi: They wrote a lot about false gurus.

Gregoire: I already told the story Mother, just now, yes.

Shri Mataji: Then its all right. So we can have some people, being shown this. Will be a good idea - on private. This film can be shown on private. Theyll come out of curiosity, all the journalists to see the secret.

Yogi: We have already done it Mother, and it does work. Its very good. They are very fascinated to see it.

Shri Mataji: Australia.

Yogi: There is one journalist who wrote an article about Sahaja Yoga in Austria and he is working with the justice. The one who wrote an article in Profil.

Shri Mataji: What is it? What is it, Gregoire?

Yogi: Now he said, one journalist who has written an article on Sahaja Yoga has also connection with the justice department.

Shri Mataji: You can talk to him. Better talk to him, is a good idea, Gregoire its a very good thing, you know if you have somebody in the justice. So you know what becomes illegal, what becomes legal. Very good idea. Well send you the - how can we send that, the copy of that?

Yogi: I can get it sent, Mother, I can get one of our copies, copied.

Shri Mataji: From where?

Yogi: We have two in Australia.

Shri Mataji: What is it? This is the first course now?

Gregoire: Yes Mother certainly,

Shri Mataji: So this is going to be too much, then I will have a little more.

Yogi: (noise from outside) I think they are shooting a few at the moment, Mother. (Laughter)

Yogi: Mother, do You know this picture of Yours already?

Shri Mataji: Oh, where was this?

Gregoire: [Kovalam ?]

Shri Mataji: [Hindi] Who took it - you? Gregoire is a great photographer, his brother - very great. It really attracts you like that, good one. Very good. Absolutely perfect. The sari folds and the folds of the sea, all go hand in hand. Who took, one you took Rajesh, sitting in the window, Gregoire took one.

Gregoire: Mother may we make one announcement? Those who come to the interview because its 3 oclock, and at 4 oclock is the interview so if you could please serve the food first to those who come with me to the interview. That means Herbert will come with his car and he can take Engelbert and you - okay. And Zorana, and Warren comes with me. And the visiting Sahaja Yogis if they have time and pleasure doing it so could perhaps.

Shri Mataji: Because they have to - how far is it the program from here, its closer from your home?

Gregoire: From here, it is much, the program, the interview is at my place.

Shri Mataji: No, thats all right.

Gregoire: The program is much closer from here.

Shri Mataji: Then its better they stay on. They stay all here.

Gregoire: There is no program today, Mother.

Shri Mataji: There is no program, so its all right.

Gregoire: No, we just have to be at home in one hour from my interview.

Shri Mataji: No, ours is all right, but what I am saying those who are not coming to the program can go out to visit the places, whatever.

Gregoire: Thats what I was thinking, yes.

Shri Mataji: What time they should arrive? Thats the point is - at your place?

Gregoire: This evening Mother we dont meet.

Shri Mataji: No, but some have to come to your place also, no?

Gregoire: They should come.

Shri Mataji: Like, I think Rajesh is staying with you, who else is staying with you? Your sister is staying with you, so they should be there for the interview? They need not.

Gregoire: Need not be, I think a couple of Austrians and perhaps Warren and thats enough. So I would suggest perhaps Guenter and the other Sahaja Yogis could maybe take a round, a little bit show the Prater, do the visit - little bit sightseeing. And tomorrow - so this evening nothing happen at my place. Tomorrow as [Sridumal] and Warren stay at the ashram, I would like our first car with Engelbert, Sridumal and Warren to be at my place by 9 oclock. With all the Puja things from the ashram, and you can come.

Shri Mataji: I would like to hear Mozart if it is anywhere tonight. Mozart, if its anywhere playing, tonight.

Gregoire: Okay, lets see if there is a day concert.

Shri Mataji: I mean tonight we are doing nothing.

Gregoire: Tonight, yes. Can you, can you tell?

Shri Mataji: Tonight, I am saying, Gregoire.

Gregoire: Yes, yes, I understand.

Shri Mataji: [Hindi] They are the best.

Yogi: Shri Mother, when You arrived they played Mozart at the radio, because I was going to the railway station to pick up Dhumal and the others.

Gregoire: When You arrived in Vienna yesterday evening they were playing Mozart in the radio.

Shri Mataji: Not only that but when we got into the plane, in the plane they were playing Mozart. (Laughter) But with that little superimposition of the modern dhum dhum was there. But inside the flow was of Mozart and My ears [Hindi ?]. So she told Me, "Its Mozart." Just see, how the attention is there, I hope it will work out. [Hindi] He has not seen that palace and everything.

Gregoire: Schoenbrunn, but either today, and Warren also, Schoenbrunn you have to go, he is a Sahaja Yogi, either today or tomorrow.

Shri Mataji: [Hindi] All right?

Gregoire: At what time should everybody at my place tomorrow 9:30 - 10 oclock?

Shri Mataji: 10 oclock.

Gregoire: Okay, so all those who are not with the first car, should be at 10 oclock at my place and all those present here are invited to the Puja. Come also please at 9 oclock.

Shri Mataji: [Hindi] And wheres the little one gone? Ah, he is there.

How are you [inaudible name ?] All right. Come for the weekend.

Yogini: Im very happy to be able to come.

Shri Mataji: And the children are with the?

Yogini: With the father.

Shri Mataji: Hell look after them. Did Arneaux talk to you?

Yogini: No, Shri Mataji.

Shri Mataji: Not yet?

Yogini: Arneaux, no.

Shri Mataji: I told him again. All right, Ill tell you what I told him. It was nice youve come, Im very happy. I think that can do for Me. Its quite a lot already. [Jennifer ?] what do you have for Me, very little?

[Hindi]

Yogini: It is not at all perfect, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Very nice, beautiful, what is that?

Yogini: Lasagne.

Shri Mataji: Lasagne.

Yogini: It is something Italian.

Shri Mataji: Yes, I know, its nice. All over the world, I think, people love lasagne.

So how are you [been ?], are you all right?

Yogini: Is there any time, I could have a word with you, while.

Shri Mataji: Who?

Yogini: Mother, is there any time I could talk to you for a few minutes?

Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, tomorrow can you come, tomorrow.

Yogini: Tomorrow I am here, yes.

Shri Mataji: This is a good photograph, very good. This also Gregoire has taken, is it? This one? Remember?

Yogi: I do not know, Mother.

Shri Mataji: This is also Gregoire has taken this photograph? Ask him.

Gregoire: Its possible Mother, yes, yes, yes. Why? Sorry.

Shri Mataji: I just want to explain [the place]. What about, she, what about - your sister has to come with us? Now the second group can go also.

[Hindi] Rani was a Realized Soul [Hindi] Mozart [Hindi]

How many children the queen had? How many children this queen had?

Yogi: Sixteen. Sixteen.

Shri Mataji: Must be a real mother. You see the problem was, one and two here and there. They could not assert themselves because only one person being Realized - you cant talk, you see, because people wouldnt like. They never understand.

Your friend came, Rajesh. What about you? [Hindi] Why dont you go? Rajesh is not going to come?

Gregoire: Yes Mother, I mean, whatever you want.

Shri Mataji: Just have it, Rajesh.

Gregoire: We dont need being so many for the interview, Mother.

Shri Mataji: No, no, but after all they will be going back home, isnt it? Because he is a guest in your house, he has to go to your house.

Gregoire: He will be driven by Guenter.

Shri Mataji: All right, so thats about it. But in any case go and get it now solved. Matthias also is there. Are you tired now? I told him that Matthias is like Mr. Hawk takes a vacation. Mr. Hawk, have you see the picture, takes a vacation. Poor Mr. Hawk took the vacation and he had to do all the carrying of the boxes. (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter)

Its wonderful, but really I am [inaudible] really, really very great and I have [inaudible] with it. Just leave it, no, no, little bit out of it, all right? And then you all eat.

Gregoire: So Mother, we could all go and listen to some Mozart this evening.

Shri Mataji: What?

Gregoire: We could all go and listen to some Mozart this evening.

Shri Mataji: Its possible? Im very happy. (Laughter)

Gregoire: It is possible. It will be possible. (Laughter)

Shri Mataji: I think in My presence you people enjoy more.

Yogi: Quite possible.

Shri Mataji: During all music programs. Even you see this great Amzad Ali came, and I went for his program. That must be told, nobody is here from London. Where you in London at that time? You were there. When Amzad Ali came, when Amzad Ali came. The sarod player - you were not there? Sarod player came, we went to that Commonwealth Institute, she was there. She was there. Gregoire you wouldnt believe. That you see what happened that day as usual these people just went away and left Me in the lurch and I didnt know how to reach. So I asked [Bernard ?] to drive Me down. So I was late about half an hour and he had played one raga. You should ask Rustom hell tell you. And he was absolutely boring and he bored himself and bored everyone else. And as soon as I went there you know, he touched such dimensions, Ive never heard him so good. Such dimensions he went into, he did not know what has happening to him, such dimensions [he reached]. [Hindi]

And he played a raga which My husband doesnt like at all, but it was so tremendous and so dynamic that everybody got lost in it. [Hindi] But next day I did not go, so he came to see Me two days later and he said, "I couldnt play as well as I could before and I missed Your company very much there."

Is it her office this place? Is it your office here?

Yogini: Yes.

Shri Mataji: My husband - My brother and another brother - two brothers had a company for income tax. They were [practicians ?]. But they were chartered accountants to begin with and then they did also this. But now hes a steel minister, My brother. I dont meet them at all, because I have no income, so I dont pay any taxes. I have solved My problem. (Laughter)

Gregoire: Mother, the friend of Elisabeth - Werner, is he here? Mother, Werner after his Realization started curing people. And I told him yesterday that it may be quite dangerous because I remembered what had happened to [Devlin ?].

Shri Mataji: Now.

Gregoire: Would you like to speak.

Shri Mataji: Yes, but what sort of diseases?

Gregoire: Pains in the head or in the back, in the joints.

Shri Mataji: Arthritis. No, arthritis is all right. But you use My photograph. But arthritis you shouldnt, because arthritis is due to too much of vibrations. So if he just touch the thing, the place of arthritis and put your hand outside you can take it out. Its just taking out of the vibrations. But give yourself a Bandhan, keep a photograph other way round in the pocket. But be careful.

Gregoire: He said, "I have done all this."

Shri Mataji: But be careful, because you see, one may develop a little Ekadasha Rudra, might develop, be careful. Because these vibrations are there because of some sort of an obstruction and that obstruction may get you also, is possible, one has to be careful. But another thing is the vibrated kerosene oil, if you can get, the paraffin oil, which you can. And also sugar, salt, everything. But you must learn first of all, you know. I dont want you to be in trouble doing that. Because I am more worried about My children than about other people.

Gregoire: He says, "I am doing this above all in connection with giving Self Realization, I dont do it just on its own."

Shri Mataji: So what I am saying that what you do is to ask them to put their hands towards the photograph and put it [in the thing ?] with the photograph, is always better. But for arthritis they can do one thing is to put one hand outside and one hand towards the photograph, they can clear out that. But more, it will more, theyll develop more respect and Shraddha for Sahaja Yoga. But be careful, tell him to be careful. Because people have suffered so I am worried. And also he should clear out himself every night. No problem and he has little back Agnya, I think, because of eye sight. So what he can do is to keep the light before him and watch My photo through the light, and also he can put the sun on his back Agnya with the photograph in front. Take the sun, its rays on the thing and have the thing on the photograph in the hand. Nowadays you can do, we have a nice sun. Also the flame. You can put flame - ask somebody to give a Bandhan, and the flame in front. For you also its good, you see. Yes, yes.

Yogi: And also to sit on the Mother Earth is good - that it sucks.

Shri Mataji: Is very good. Good. But you see the problem is in this country the Mother Earth is very already wet, you see so She does not suck so much of the things like arthritis. Arthritis comes from more cold and humid air. Of course the Mother Earth is very good, but in India, not here that way. Because its a hot country so the Mother Earth sucks much more. But this paraffin oil is all right because it comes also from Mother Earth. So is all right, you can use it. Also get some oil for your hair also, Saturdays if you rub your hair with that oil. Get all these oils vibrated by Me is the best thing. Saturday night.

Lets go, Rajesh.

Rajesh: Sorry Mother?

Shri Mataji: Lets go. But he can be driven by somebody else. Lets go back why I am saying because I would like to rest for a while.

Thank you very much! Its wonderful! Wonderful the Italian food. (Laughter) Because you see, Germans make everything all right, so even Italian food is made better than Italian. Yes very well, efficiency personified - Germans are. If they become efficient in Sahaja Yoga no one can beat them.

Yogi: This is our all desire, Mother.

Shri Mataji: Just you can do it, I know that. As you have developed such a nice mechanism outside, the inside mechanism also you can manage. Isnt it? After all, you have the deftness, you can do it.

Very nice lunch, very nice meeting you all! May God bless you! Then hope to see you tomorrow to Puja. Before coming to the Puja dont talk to anyone, just take your bath, stay quiet, [coming off from office activities]. Thank you very much!

My purse should be there. You come tomorrow there. Thank you!
