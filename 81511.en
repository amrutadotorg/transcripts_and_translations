 (England)
I have a friend, or have a friend, called Sarah. Sarah and I have children of the same age, and our children went to the same nursery school. We were both expecting our third child, with very large tummies. Because we only used to meet at school, I said to her one day, "We have to stop meeting like this. Come around to my house and we'll have coffee or tea or something."

Both our children were born, so the whole thing was delayed a little. She came around to see me when the children were a couple of months old. I had decided that I would go to a yoga class because I wanted to get fit, and I had gone off to one the night before. I was telling Sarah about this because I didn't really know her very well.

I said, "You know what I did last night? I went to this class and I lay down on the floor on this mat, and this woman is telling me to put my right toe in my left ear and I'll get ultimate enlightenment." I was thinking, "This is ridiculous." I'm just not that kind of person, so I got up and walked out because I really didn't want to be there.

She said, "Oh, were you interested in yoga then?"

I said, "Oh, yes."

So she said, "Well, I know a lady."

I went to my first meeting with Sarah. I had always been a good Church of England girl, brought up to do all the right things, but it kind of wasn't enough. It wasn't right; I wasn't quite there. Mother wasn't actually at that first meeting, and I'm not even quite sure where it was. I sat there and didn't really feel an awful lot, but I thought, "Well, I'll give it another go."

I went along the following week to Hampstead, and Mother was there. She sat up at the front, and I sat in the front row with various other new people. This time, she didn't come down from her chair; she worked on everybody individually. So I'm sitting there at the end as she starts working her way down the line, thinking, "This is going to be my big moment. I'm going to get it. It's going to be me." Very ego-like.

She gets to me, looks at me, and says, "Oh, you're all right," and moves on.

Now, if she said that to me today, I'd be so thrilled. It was a very good lesson for me. But I just knew that, like Mark said, I'd come home. This was where I wanted to be, and I didn't want to be anywhere else.
