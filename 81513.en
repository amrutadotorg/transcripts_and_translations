When I was at university, I thought there's more to life than meets the eye. My first venture into finding out about that was I went along to TM. That introduced me to something, but of course, I suddenly realized that there were no answers there. They talked about realisation as something that was at the end of a long path that you may eventually get to.

I came across an old Time Out magazine where it said that Shri Mataji gave realisation. So I thought, "Well, this is something I've got to go to because I don't have to wait." But there was no telephone number or anything like that, so I had to wait until I went to the Mind, Body and Spirit Festival. I went around the whole thing, past all the pyramid power and those sort of weird and wonderful things, and came out with a big headache. I was lucky I picked up a leaflet outside, and that was for Shri Mataji's program.

So I went from there to the program. Shri Mataji was giving a program in the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, and Mia was there. I got my realisation there, and that answered all my questions, really.
