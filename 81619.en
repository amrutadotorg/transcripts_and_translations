Interviewer: How did you hear about Shri Mataji? How did you get to know about Her?

Speaker: We were flying to Bombay. My brother had told me that I needed to go to Korea. My mother used to go to India, and I went to India to study. I showed my mother's address at the shrine in her temple. From within, the Mother told me, "I have this form." She blessed me and said, "Go."

Interviewer: So the idol of the Mother blessed you?

Speaker: The Mother showed me Her face. She was wearing a white sari with a red border. She opened her mouth and said, "I am the one. You go there." She showed me the address. "This is the address. If this is correct, then go. Otherwise, send me back home." She showed me Her whole face and said, "I am the one. You go there."

Then I went to Mumbai.

Interviewer: When you went to Mumbai and arrived at the PNC Road building, Shri Mataji opened the door. Please tell us about that.

Speaker: When I went there, I met a man downstairs. I asked him, "Who is this Shri Mataji?" He told me that he knew Her. I climbed one, two, three stairs, but he asked me to stay down. As I was getting down, Shri Mataji opened the door and said, "You are looking for me."

I went in, and She held me and took me inside. She was sitting on a cot. When I came out, he asked me, "How did you come?" I told him, "My granddaughter came."

She told me, "Come tomorrow and bring her too." But if I wanted to do this, it was not the beginning of the month. My daughter was pregnant, and her delivery would be in a month. "After that," She said, "when it starts, I will tell you. I will call you. I will give you the address."

So I said, "I haven't started Sahaj Yog yet. I will talk to you after one and a half months, and I will leave the address." And every day I would take my granddaughter there, and the Mother would give her vibrations. Then I gave the address, and after one and a half months, I got a postcard that there was a shibir in Bordi, and I should come. It was the first shibir in Bordi.

Interviewer: Tell us about that.

Speaker: At that time, there was a railway manager named Lal Saheb. He came to Gopi Puri and gave us the details. My mother was at the station. Saheb and my mother were going to come with us to Bordi. I got up and said "Namaskar" to him. He came with me to the train. While talking to us, we reached Bordi. My mother got off at Bordi, and we had a room. There were about 30-40 people.

Interviewer: 30-40 people?

Speaker: There were 30-40 people in the railway group, but the compartment was bigger. There must have been 100 people in Bordi in total. There were people from all over India. Shri Mataji used to go to a company where a Mr. Modi worked. His sons used to go there and say, "Let's go, some yoga is starting."

Interviewer: So what happened in the Bordi seminar?

Speaker: Mataji told some people to come up. She didn't call my father. People would put their hands under Her feet, and Mataji would place Her feet on them. And then She would lift the Kundalini like this. There was no one else; Mataji Herself used to lift the Kundalini. Now people lift the Kundalini, but then, Mataji used to do it.

Interviewer: Did Mataji do this to you?

Speaker: No. Two or three people went, then I went and sat down. She used to hold my ears like this and say, "You are very good." She asked, "Who do you believe in?" I said, "Amba Ji." She said, "You are a devotee of the Devi, so I am inside you. If you want to know me, then you must know. You are a devotee. People know me as Mrs. Srivastava, but they know you as the Devi. They say you are Amba Ji. You are a devotee of Amba Ji, and that's why you recognized who I am."

The protocol that the Devi has, she has been in that protocol with Mataji since then. Just like Mataji goes ahead, Baba always goes back. She knew how to go in front of a Devi. That's why Mataji understood that she knows everything.

Then we got up and talked. We had to go back in three days. Mataji and all of us climbed up and sat down. I sat down too. She used to say to everyone, "You will go home tomorrow. Today you will pass. So sleep and when you wake up, see what is in front of you." I used to go home with my daughter, but I stayed in a separate room. I would sleep. As Mataji said, in the morning, I would wake up and see Mataji sitting there in front of us.

Then in the afternoon, I said, "Let's meet." She asked, "What are you looking at?" I said, "You are sitting there." She laughed loudly. She said, "Whatever you see, come and tell me in the afternoon." So when Baba meditated, Mataji was sitting in a separate room. Then everyone went. She asked everyone what they saw. They said, "Nothing, this and that." Baba said, "You were sitting in front of me." So Mataji laughed loudly. She said, "Yes, you know me. You saw me." In a separate room. From that day, it was time for Dulliya to go to Mataji.

Interviewer: Did you go a second time? What was your experience? Mataji kept you in one room?

Speaker: Yes, in one room. We both lived in the same room.

Interviewer: What did you see, Baba? The whole Sahaja Yoga program happened, and it was quite late, going into the morning. Baba and Mataji were going back. Mataji was going ahead, and you were going back. What did you see?

Speaker: Mataji was doing all this... and I was going. It was so good. Mataji was looking back, as if to say, "I am doing all this to tell you."

Interviewer: So what did you see in the sky? What came from the sky?

Speaker: Everything. From the sky, like this...

Interviewer: Stars?

Speaker: Stars, yes. The whole sky. That was the second time. At night, when there was another shibir, there were bhajans, and we were sitting. Everyone had a call, and in one room, Mataji had kept me for a prayer. When it was night, the program was going on, and we were going to the room for bhajans. We were walking on the road, and the stars in the skyâ€”they were all next to Mataji. We reached the room.

Mataji's bed was there, and so was I. But Mataji had this habit. When She would go to sleep, I had to sit on the bed and keep my head on it. So while Mataji was sleeping, I saw that the stars were all on Her bed. They turned.

Interviewer: Why did your mother stay with you?

Speaker: The vibration was low.

Interviewer: Why did your mother have to take vibrations from you?

Speaker: It was my wish. The other wish was that if the Sakshat Devi comes to me, I will fulfill Her desire. That's why my mother used to say, "You sit, you can't sleep before me." It was my habit to massage my mother's feet with a silver bowl. She used to work the whole day.

Interviewer: Then it turns black, doesn't it?

Speaker: No, no, She used to take ghee from a silver bowl and rub it on Her feet. It would turn black. So She would take the bowl and rub it on Her feet, and it would become like kajal. My mother used to say, "If you rub it like kajal, it will stay sharp in your eyes."

Interviewer: Yes, tell us about the outing. Because the Devi came to your house, how did She do the outing?

Speaker: She used to live in a room. Our bathroom was nearby. My mother was special. Before taking a bath, She used to massage Herself with ghee. The Mother would go to the bathroom to take a bath, and her elder son used to go to the back of the bathroom and take vibrations.

Interviewer: And the granddaughter for whom you met Her the first time, she was cured?

Speaker: She was cured by the time of the Bordi shibir.

Interviewer: Tell us more. At that time, there was no telephone, so Shri Mataji must have written letters.

Speaker: Yes, She used to write letters with Her own hands. We can't even imagine such a thing.

Interviewer: Have you read any of Shri Mataji's letters in any of the books? Yes, please show us. And tell us more about what She wrote.

Speaker: It's in Marathi, you can read it.

Interviewer: What is your name?

Speaker: My name is Kishore Kumar. The next day I went to his house, and he said, "Come, Rajkumar." I didn't say that my name is not Rajkumar. Since then, I have been Rajkumar.

Interviewer: So where did the name Rahul Ba come from?

Speaker: Rahul Ba is our surname. Surname Rahul.

Interviewer: So what did She write in the first letter that came from Shri Mataji?

Speaker: She wrote, "I have been here for so many days. You have to come to meet me. I have to go to Delhi later, so you have to come now to meet me."

Interviewer: Wow. Thank you.
