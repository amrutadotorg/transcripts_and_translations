I've gone through the drug scene, experimenting with drugs and everything, and unfortunately, you tend to get stuck in a rut with that. But the seeking was there through the drugs. I started to get involved with hatha yoga, macrobiotics, and experimenting with many different things. I read in a book about self-realization, becoming one with the whole, and things like that. When I saw the word "self-realization," I thought, "Well, that's what I want."

But I thought, "Well, I'm never going to get it." Then something happened. I suddenly knew that there was God. I think it must have been that Shri Mataji's attention was on the area where I was living, because about two weeks later, Shri Mataji went there to the girls' grammar school, and that's where I went for the program. I just knew there was God, whereas before I just wasn't sure. The desire was there, but I thought I'd never get it.

And then in the local paper, there was a photograph of Shri Mataji with the words, "Self-realization for seekers of truth." I thought, "Wow, that's what I want."

It came to the big night of the program. It was a Thursday night, July 26th, 1979. I was into all this health food and everything, so much so that it got more and more extreme, where I used to have sacks of muesli. And I thought, "I'll just have a few nuts from the muesli." Then I thought, "I'll just have a few more." The next thing I knew, I was just ramming it in. I think the negativity knew it was going to go, and I was just ramming all this dry muesli—just loads of it. I found myself with my head in the sack and suddenly thought, "What am I doing? This is out of control." I realized it was time to go and literally just walked down the hill.

"Seek and you shall find." So I just had to walk down the hill to the school where Shri Mataji was. As I was walking, the muesli was expanding in my stomach. I think there were about 60 people there. I just felt intense heat and masses of sweat, and I thought, "What's all this about a cool breeze?" And then, lots and lots of pain.

Shri Mataji got up. She used to work on everybody; she'd go right into the audience and talk and communicate. But she passed me and went on to the next person. I didn't think too much of it, but I was in a lot of pain. After everybody had gone, I was the only person left. I had a group of Sahaja Yogis working on me as I was sitting there, and this pain in my back was just getting so bad.

Someone whacked my back right where the pain was, and then I knew that the person could feel it. It was my first taste of collective consciousness. I thought, "They know that it's there." Then the pain moved to another spot, and they whacked that. That really impressed me. I was suddenly aware that everybody had gone except for me, and they said, "Come back to Tony Paniotto's place."

Shri Mataji was going there, and I was saying, "No, no, no." In the end, they talked me into going. It was just a small terraced house with loads and loads of people. Someone was rubbing Shri Mataji's feet, and I thought, "Well, what's all this about?" Immediately, Shri Mataji had them stop. The person at her feet got up and moved away, and they were gesturing to me. And I was hesitating, and they were gesturing, and I was hesitating. In the end, I went over.

She was as big as a mountain. That's how I remember her in the beginning; she was just massive. She said, "Hello, how are you?" And I said, "I'm all right." And anything I said, people laughed. They didn't really have a lot of discrimination; they laughed at every single thing I said. At that time, my mum had gone crazy, and my dad was going crazy because she was going crazy.

Everything had turned around. The son was sorting the parents out, sort of thing. Everyone said, "I just recognized her instantly." But I didn't have a clue what was going on. Yet, my heart just knew. I knew that she was the one I could tell anything to. I said, "I've got this terrible pain in my back." She got me to turn around, and she was putting her hand all over my back.

Then someone came in with a huge plate of meat and chips and everything. And I was horrified. I thought, "Oh my God, she eats meat and chips!" Chips! Because I'd gone through all this macrobiotic stuff. Then she said, "I've got to stop now." I was really upset. I felt like a child wrenched away from his mother. That was my first meeting—a sort of condensed version, really.

But I remember how big, how huge she was. She just looked like a mountain to me at the time.
