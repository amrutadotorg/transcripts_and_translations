Talk to Sahaja Yogis
Mumbai (India)
Talk Language: Marathi | Translation (Hindi to English) - VERIFIED, Translation (Marathi to English) - VERIFIED

Yesterday, at the Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan, I spoke to you about the 3 powers of the God Almighty. Many people who were present said that a lot of things that were told went over their heads. [They couldn’t understand a lot of what Mother was saying.] 

So, it is best that I tell you only the things that go through the heart. It is true that the brain cannot comprehend such things. The people who claim to be scientists, educated, learned are not able to absorb (the knowledge) about Sahaja yoga. I have seen many such cases. And then there are everyday average people – the ones who are not educated, who sometimes don’t even have means to eat, wear clothes – those people easily imbibe Sahaja yoga.

You cannot realise God through education. Although if I say this, all the big shots in the education industry would come after me! You may be able to understand how the material world works through education. But to grasp the workings of the Divine (God) you need different ways, different qualities. Out of them, the most important one is the quality of ‘Bholepana’ – which translates to ‘innocence’ in English. Small children have innocence in them. 

Although you will find a few grown-ups who are also very innocent. They get cheated, people take advantage of their innocence and trouble them a lot. They get tortured a lot too. This is why all the saints have suffered at the hands of people in this world, and they still do. That makes me feel sad at times. All of you who have got the Realization are saints. Not only saints but you have become the members of the divine kingdom. You are now in the same place as the gods. The same godly people. These are the same gods whose description we have read about in the Puranas [ancient Indian scriptures].

These Gods have now been awakened inside of you all. The divinity aspect is enlightened within you.

So, in such a state (of yours) it is obvious that the bhoots [evils] will wander around you and trouble you. Let them. They can only trouble you to a certain extent; until they reach their limits. Their powers are restricted only in the three dimensions of this world. Means only limited to worldly matters. At the most they may harm you physically. Let them. The human body is mortal. You may be harmed emotionally. Let it be. But I have offered you and shown you a fort (Balekilla* – She refers to a fort of Shivaji where he used to take refuge to be safe from the enemy). I have shown you this inside yourselves. That is the fort of Nirvichar state, thoughtless awareness. Always remember that no one will dare to step in if you establish yourself inside that fort. 

But you must form a habit of making yourself sit inside it. Shri Krishna is called as Ranchhod-das [the one who runs away from the battlefield]. Ranchhod-das meaning nothing else but the one escaping all the bombardments of negativities and taking refuge in his own fort. That is why he is called Ranchhod-das. And the negativities stay stunned and helpless outside! We are aware that there exists a lot of black magic. We know that ill minded people are practicing all sorts of dark arts. I am also aware that they are troubling you. They torture you. But how far can they trouble you? You should be able to challenge all those negativities to come and try attacking you in that fort of yours (of thoughtless awareness). So, you should never forget about this fort of yours. This circle of protection had never been granted to humans before. It has now been made available to you with great difficulties; the door has been opened, so go and take a place inside. Then let me see which negativity has the nerve to trouble you or give you any disease or health problems! 

You need to establish yourself inside that fort. Even if all your family members oppose you, you should be able to keep your state within saying ‘do what you want, I will stick to my state within’! Even if the whole society goes against you, you should be able to sustain yourself inside your fort. And at last, even if the entire world opposes you, and if you establish your foothold inside that fort, who can enter it?

And the day someone enters your fort, he also receives his self-realization. This miracle/magic is in our hands, so pull others inside your fort. Let them see! Then with whom they will fight, for they will understand that we are all one. All these stupid people who are wandering around, they are digging their own graves. And this time, if they fall in their grave, into that hell, (I) will not let them rise again. So be alert; there is no need to be scared. If you are all prepared, let us create that giant fortress together. In this Kali Yuga; no one has the daring to confront Me.

These are murderers who are attacking children from the back. So don’t pay attention there. Be assured that no harm can ever be done to you, and you will always remain safe – but you need to stay in your shelter (of your fort) and not to fall into their trap. Some such (negative) people are in Dadar [an area in Mumbai, India]. The black/dark art which these false gurus are spreading, have destroyed many homes so far and I know about it. I had warned you already before. Only two of them have left Dadar, but others are still out there. They are not for the welfare of people but to make money for themselves. They can surely earn money, everyone does that. But they are doing this in the name of God. Earning money in the name of God is objectionable.

But it is unpardonable when they are spreading bhoots [preaching negativity] in the name of God. God will never forgive such people. In the early days, the bhoots were real bhoots. But now these are people selling bhoots in the name of God! They put these bands and strings (supposed to help) around the wrists of people and send the bhoots through those in their houses. These kinds of businesses are going on rampantly. I was amazed to see these sorts of businesses going on in London on such a scale and I was wondering  whether this is London or Bhoot-nagari: the city of bhoots!

As soon as you touch the grounds of London, the bhoots are swarming everywhere! Wherever you see, it is just devil worship. They are everywhere where Christ had warned against following the path of such bhoots. Warned against doing such work for devils – those same Christians, are now scavenging the graveyards for blood and ashes and are practicing these dark arts. They are doing planchettes! Means they are doing exactly what was forbidden. Christ had spoken about it and so had Nanak Saheb. No one else had spoken about it so avowedly about this devil worship. And now all these Christians – who used to rule over India as British – have now been possessed by these people. The streets and alleys of London are rampant with factories producing these bhoots. And now what has happened to their wisdom! When I speak out against them, the people don’t accept it. The only difference is the people out here in India sell it under the name of God while people out there sell it as it is: they call it the art of Satan, or they call it witchcraft, etc. 

There is no falsehood there like we have in India. But those arts have been ‘exported’ there from India. Many are exported there! All those big false gurus who went there from India have now become so rich, that each one has 35 odd Rolls Royces [luxury cars]. One Rolls Royce costs around 10,000,000 Rs (in 1975). This is what the situation is in England. And it is no better in India. You need to first decide if you want Dharma or adharma? If you want Dharma, then you need to stand on truth. For those who are looking for untruth, I don’t have it. I don’t have chamatkars [magic tricks], I won’t pull out a ring to give you if you want those sorts of things. 

I have meditation. I want to teach you the art of unlocking this great treasure, this great potential power placed inside of you by the Divine. I want to ask all these false gurus who are doing such gimmicks like giving out rings, “They should solve all the problems of India! They should be made Prime minister. They will give the rings to everyone!  Why do they entertain only the rich? Distribute to the needy, there are lots of poor people. They do not pay attention to the poor at all. All their attention is on the pockets of the rich and the rich are stupid enough to go to such people. Such is the state of affairs.

You are not aware of the fact that these bhoots are the cause of such a miserable state of this country. So never help such people for even a slight gain or never stand at their doorstep to seek any help. If anyone speaks about bhoots, please do not go to them. Everything is in Dharma.  All the things in this world including wealth and even much beyond, all of them are encompassed by the Dharma. Everything is Dharma. All of it is created by Dharma alone. There is nothing that exists beyond Dharma. And that what exists beyond cannot be described to you.

If you want to suffer for 7 generations in hell or if you want to get out of the cycle of human birth and step into the birth cycle of insects, only then you may walk on the path of this bhoot vidya. You must speak openly about it. That all these games of magic should be brought to a stop.  All these false magical gimmicks should be stopped. And you shouldn’t be scared to do that. The real magic within should manifest, the light within should shine. And the flowers blooming in that joy should spread their perfume everywhere so that this mud of dirt gets transformed into a lake of lotuses. That time has come.

The entire universe is ready for that time. The five elements are awaiting to help you out. All the great incarnations are showering blessings upon you to carry out this great task. Everyone is fully prepared to help you out in every possible way. It is now up to the humans to make a decision. They must choose whether we are following Dharma or Adharma. Are we supporting Dharma or Adharma?” It is not possible to buy the Dharma. Those who have made a business out of God, those who have made a mockery of Dharma by fooling and cheating the innocent, all those who have created this tragic irony of Dharma, all of them will have to suffer for their sins. But the biggest sin of all is to torture the saints. There is no greater sin than distracting the seekers from their path to seek God. And the punishment for that sin is so horrific that it cannot be described.

So never ever should anyone take to such evil work. The way Dharma is beautiful, guiding, loving, encompassing as well as integrating everyone together, same way it is refulgent too. It is so radiant that it can also be destructive which can burn and annihilate everything . Dharma has got the same powers as  Agni [fire]. You better keep this in mind. This time, I am noticing even more such things in Dadar (area in Mumbai).What kind of diseases and  what kind of troubles , today we are giving to our own mothers , sisters and children ;It is only us troubling our own people; no one else. Dogs and cats do not trouble humans. The humans are harming their fellow human beings. They are the ones slitting each other’s throats, no one else. And the reason this is happening is because the rakshasas [demons] have entered into the humans. And at same time a bhakta (devotee) also resides in the human.

The demons only wish to slit the devotee’s throat. If they don’t do it, they wouldn’t be rakshasas! But the situation is worse as the rakshasas have entered into each of the  saints as well.Now What can I do? The one who I have made my son – the rakshasa also entered inside.Now what can I do ?  I can’t beat this child, neither can I embrace him. What a helpless situation for a Mother! The Mother has come to visit the child, but the child is hosting a bhoot in his head. Now what can I do? Throw away all those rakshasas who are sitting on your heads! Why are you carrying them with all that pride? What good have they ever done to you? There is scarcity of food, scarcity of water.... the mother earth is helpless in front of you, the sun is also frustrated and the sea has thrown his hands in the air because of this stupidity of humans.

The people troubling the saints should keep this in their minds – if you trouble a saint for a few pennies, you will be answerable for it, not only in this lifetime, but many births after this. I know that there are few people who have settled in this society (In general) who are making money in the wrong way. Know that they are here to trouble.keep this in mind ! Know that I am the mother of those rakshasas as well, as I am yours. But to protect you, I have killed them many times and will be killing them. So do not worry. Even if they are my children, I will still kill them. Let them see. Hopefully some of them will ascend and become humans, then we will see. 

But don’t you fall for their games and illusions. We cannot fill our stomachs with lies . As it is, the nation is in ruins – but don’t ruin the future of coming generations. Great souls are taking births in these times. Do not create hell for them but make some special arrangements for them, create something beautiful to welcome them on this earth. What have you done here for your children? I am standing here. Ask for anything and I will give you. But from where can I bring wisdom? From where can we borrow the wisdom for you? You have to get your wisdom. It is the only thing I am asking you to get, I am ready to do the rest of the hard work. That seed (of wisdom) lies within you. It is absolutely true that the seed lies inside you.

‘Vaalya’ transformed into ‘Vaalmiki’. The (power) thing by which he got transformed, is also within you. He didn’t necessarily want to become Vaalmiki, nor did he have that much wisdom. The day he realized that he is killing his soul through his acts for little money, he decided that day only. He thought, “for whom I was doing it? I have done so much; what have I done for myself?” Think this way once and see what you have done for yourself. I yearn for you and   my soul yearns for you every moment..( I am concerned ). I want to light the lamp inside you all – the light which will spread all over the world. You will be surprised but it is going to be this country itself – India – that is going to become the light of the world. Don’t be scared. It is only a matter of time. Let this time pass. It is you all from this country, who are going to sit on top of the vibrations one day,bear this in mind . And there is only one reason for that. We agree everything is messed up in this country – but we still haven’t learnt to disrespect our mothers, we still haven’t lost that morality. And until this situation changes, the position of this country [in the Kingdom of God] is not going to ever change.

The other one Bhog Bhumi – land of materialism ; this Yoga Bhumi – land of spiritual experience. You are not to decide on this. It has already been decided by the Gods. And why do the people born in this country consider themselves inferior only because of scarcity of food? Only you people can live like this, not the people in London. They start crying even for something as small as the collar of the shirt being long or short. You are the true Sanyasis as you can sleep anywhere, can eat whatever and are still happy in everything. You have the blessings of your Mother.

So, if you want to disrespect your Mother, go ahead and do it and then be ready for the consequences! This is true that one can be angry or upset with Mother, but it is also a fact that the highest relationship in humans is the one with Mother and that one can see(get darshan) God almighty in Her only. And only the mothers of this country have the capacity to bear so much. Other places, they ask the children to leave the house at a very young age of 10 years. And if the children do not help in the chores, they are asked to pay for their food, such are the mothers outside (India). The child can die, but the old mother (as old as 90 years) doesn’t want to spend any money as she needs that for her lipstick. And see how you honor your Mother. Only here such mothers take birth; nowhere in the world you would find a mother like in India. You can go round and see that- But you have tortured her so much. Dharma will be lost in this case. Do not disrespect dharma. Stop all or any plans of humiliating your Mother. Return the money. I know everything. Don’t think that I don’t know you!

[Shri Mataji turns soft again.] Anyways, whatever it is, right now – in this lifetime, now..you need to get your realization. Let’s eat the laadoos [sweets] first and then we will sort out the rest. What else can make the Mother happy? Mother has prepared such nice food for you all and then she has to scold you! But I have to do it sometimes. So now relax and sit down to eat. Eat your food in a relaxed mood. And take the amrut [nectar], acquire the amrut. Let this amrut in the form of love, flow through you into the entire world. Here we are set on changing the course of this world – and you are still involved with these petty nuisances. All these things are going to be recorded in the history of this world – keep that in mind, all the people who have committed such stupidities. Each name will be remembered, and people will spit upon them. Not only their children but generations will be blamed for those wrongdoings. So, these were the dirty people who did these dirty deeds!!! Do the work which will be considered bright! Enlighten yourself.  That is what the Mother wants to give to her children. Go into meditation – close your eyes.

[Shri Mataji is speaking in Hindi]

The talk I had to give today, it had to be in Marathi. You see,without Marathi you cannot get the same fun , this kind of heroic language I can’t manage to do in Hindi. I can manage only in Marathi! So, forgive me if I didn’t speak in Hindi. Forgive me again as I had to tell some things to some specific people – it was not meant for you.

[Shri Mataji again speaking in Marathi] [Someone in the audience asks a question referring to some guru.] Don’t say names (Shri Mataji is referring to chanting of names given by false gurus). At least, for the time being, do not take names. Many people are lost. People have gone to many different (so called) gurus. What is a guru, who is a Guru, who is not; who is Guru, who is animal – how to recognize it – one feels it inside. You can recognize it through vibrations. The vibrations flowing from your hand can tell you who the real guru is and who is not. So first learn how to get that awareness and then decide who a real gufru is. Why are you making anyone a guru before like mad men?

Get the eyes to see the real guru. Until then keep all the gurus aside. Keep them away. For now, you are your own guru, and I am your Mother.
