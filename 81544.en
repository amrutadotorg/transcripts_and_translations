 (England)
I was in Sheffield. My brother got his realisation in Brighton—he got his self-realisation first—and my mother told me about it on the telephone. She said, "If he's found this woman and he says she's God, I believe him."

So I thought, "Hmm, interesting, but no thanks." I was a little bit hesitant. Then he gave me my realisation in Sheffield, and I had the most incredible experience. It was amazing, but something in me, I think, made me realise that I would have to change quite a lot of what I was doing. I was a professional singer working in nightclubs, so I was drinking and smoking a little bit, and I wasn't that bothered about giving it up.

I met Mother eventually, I think it was several months later, in Brighton. She came to a house where I was staying at the time, and I remember just sitting in this room thinking, "Who are you?" She kept looking at me and saying, "Don't have any doubts. You mustn't doubt." I wasn't aware that I was doubting, but I think I probably was.

It was quite an amazing experience. I didn't immediately start changing, but I think over a period of years I did change. Despite myself.
