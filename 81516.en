I was seeking, and there was someone that I knew—we were all a bunch of old hippies, really. He lived a few doors away, and he suddenly disappeared. I was quite worried about him because he had started taking a lot of drugs, quite heavy drugs, and I didn't see him for six months.

Then one day, I bumped into him on the seafront, and he looked completely different. He was just transformed, so different. I said, "What's happened to you?"

He said, "Well, I've started doing this meditation. I'll come around tonight and tell you about it."

So he came around that evening, and that was it. He came in and said, "Right, sit down. I'm going to work on you."

I said, "What?" And that was it, really.

He brought a photo of Mother with him. That night I had a dream that she was up on a hill somewhere in India, I think it was in a tea plantation, and she was talking to lots and lots of people that were there. I woke up the next morning, and I just knew that that was it.
