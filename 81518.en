I'm slightly different because I got my realisation in Sheffield in January 1981, and Shri Mataji was in India at the time; she was on an India tour. So I got my realisation from the photograph. It felt incredibly powerful. I'd just met a friend on the street, and I remember I was in a very low state at the time. I felt really depressed, and I'd been looking and looking for something and had gotten more and more unhappy.

I was living this lifestyle, much the same as everybody else—full of hippies. I was living in a house where people were dealing drugs. I was in a really bad, low position, and I met this friend on the street in Sheffield, and we went for a drink. I said, "I feel so unhappy and so low." She said, "I know exactly what you need." She had been down to Brighton and gotten her realisation and was back visiting her parents. We sat in their front room, and I got my realisation.

I remember being absolutely blown away. I didn't really know what had happened to me or understand it, but I just knew it was fantastic. I was like, "Wow, this is quite amazing." The only word I can think of is "blown away." I had to keep going back to see her and say, "Oh, can we do that thing again? Whatever it was that you were doing."

I was drinking, smoking, doing everything—all drugs. And like Anne, I just stopped. Literally, within about two days, I'd stopped everything and really started to do this. It just grew from there.

But I didn't actually meet Shri Mataji until the Sahasrara Day Puja, which would have been in May. So it was about four or five months before I actually met Mother. I do remember it very strongly. It was in Chelsham Road. I remember sitting there, and I was so excited because four or five months seemed like forever to meet Mother. I remember turning around as she came through the door into the meditation room.

I was just struck. It was almost like she was radiant, like this radiant lady. But I was also really struck by how physically small she was, her frame. In my mind, she was this very large, wonderful lady, and then you see Mother, and her stature is so small. But it was just amazing.

I remember she walked in and took her seat in Chelsham Road. It was beautiful. They had lots of irises and little narcissi on either side of Mother—do you remember the arch in the meditation room at Chelsham Road? And then I remember I just cried. I think I cried for the whole puja because I'd met Mother, and she kept passing me handkerchiefs. So that was my first experience of meeting Mother.
