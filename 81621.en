It's very difficult to share a story of one miracle because there are many, many. And partly because I have diabetes, there are lots of things associated with that that have happened to help me that really are miracles. But this is a different story.

It was, I think, in the early 1990s, and we heard we could go and meet Shri Mataji at Heathrow Airport. Sometimes we were allowed to go, sometimes we weren't. We only heard at 10 o'clock in the morning, and the plane was due to land at about 11 o'clock. This meant Shri Mataji would usually come out of the special exit around half past 11.

Brian Virgo was living with us, and his car wasn't working very well. Bill Hanslow at Bromsgrove said we could borrow his, but Bromsgrove was in a different direction from Heathrow. So anyway, we set off to Bromsgrove, and Bill kindly lent us his car.

By about half past 11, we were near Oxford, and the vibrations were quite warm. We thought we weren't going to make it on time, as we couldn't see any of the other Sahaja Yogis to share experiences with. And then, as we were driving into Heathrow, the vibrations became very cool.

Suddenly, we saw Shri Mataji and Sir C.P. Srivastava just standing on their own on one of the parallel pavements. Jennifer stopped the car in the middle of the road, and we got out. We could bow to Mother and offer her the flowers, and She smiled at us. That was just incredible and amazing.

Can I tell you a personal health miracle?
