 (England)
You see, what happened? I met her in England. It was, again, quite a story, I must say. I heard about her in Berkeley from a student called Rajesh Shah who was there. When I went to Berkeley, I went to Rajesh's flat, and there were a couple of people there. They were stoned, and Rajesh was sort of watching it. I remember one who exited the flat crawling on his own.

Anyway, he started speaking to me about Shri Mataji and wanted to give me my realization. I said, "No way, who do you think you are?" I was not going to get my realization from this guy. Then he told me about Shri Mataji, and he told me—point-blank—that she was Sita, she was Radha, she was the Virgin Mary. That blew me away. I thought, well, because the guy was not stupid, then I need to change.

Then I flew to London. I had a friend in London who was a "lifeguard queen." It turned out that two years earlier, I had visited him in Cambridge. He picked me up at the airport—he's a really sweet boy. I remember I was in the car, and he tells me, "Grégoire, I'm having an affair. I hope you don't mind." I said, "Of course I don't mind. Why should I mind?" I thought he meant he had a girlfriend. And then I was in the back of the car and he said, "Well, I'm sure you'll like Richard." And I was like, "Oh, shit." I wasn't really prepared for that. So, we were moving into another cultural sort of interest.

When I came back to London to see Shri Mataji, I stopped at his flat. And this boy, who had been cute and really sweet, now looked like the portrait of Dorian Gray. You could see he was... so it's from that flat that I called Shri Mataji. I said, "My friend Rajesh..." and I still remember her voice. Her voice was like it was coming from the clouds. I was in that flat, and there were a couple of guys around, and it was really weird. And then I had that voice that came from somewhere else. She said, "Yes, sure, come and meet me. I'm waiting for you."

So I went. I remember I went to this house, and I rang the bell, and then she was on the right side, all dressed in white. And I was all scruffy, of course. I tried to look like I had some education, so I actually kissed her hand, and she said, "May God bless you." That's the way it started.

At some point, she told me, "I will have to test you." I burst into laughter and said, "Oh, you can test me," because I didn't know what it meant. In those days, we thought we could not do anything wrong. I was beginning to suspect that I'd done a few things wrong. I think the second time when I visited, I had come back from Switzerland. I was in the little salon, you remember the salon? I have a memory of this salon. There was this wooden statue of Ganesha we had at the ashram. At some point, she asked me to ask forgiveness from Shri Ganesha, because I felt that I was finished because of the Mooladhara Chakra. I was lying on my tummy, just flat, before the statue of Shri Ganesha. She asked me, "Ask forgiveness to Shri Ganesha." So I was lying like this before the statue, and I was saying, "Please, Shri Ganesha, forgive me." And then I felt a cool vibration coming from the statue. I tell you, this was something.

In that same room, I was about to leave, and I felt I was not going to be able to maintain this state. Because as he described in his book, when you are with her, you feel so comfortable—the comfort of the Spirit. You feel so within the territory of love. All right? But when you leave, it's another matter. So I felt, "I'm not going to manage that." I had to take my things and go. She was sitting almost as close as you and me. And she said... she was like this, and then she said, "You shouldn't be sad." I was feeling sad, but I wasn't telling her. She just said to me, "You shouldn't feel sad."

She did something like that with her hand, and then... it was a complete, total... you know, when we feel vibrations, it's in a gaseous state, according to the sixth chapter of the Jnaneshwari. But then, when that raises to a higher power... it's like a cloud. The cloud becomes condensed into water, right? So it was a liquid. It was not gaseous; it was a liquid coming into each and every cell of the body. You know, human beings imagine that the highest intensity of sensation they can experience is sex. I mean, for all of us, right? But that was more than that, and in the entire body. It was sacred because it was spiritual; it was sacred, but it was also physical. So it was both sacred and physical.

I felt this thing, and that's when I knew. A saint cannot do that. A prophet cannot do that. So that's when I said, "Gee, this is something else." It went away after some time, and I never had such a powerful experience afterwards. Never, ever. And yet, afterwards, I hope I was better than what I was then. But this was her compassion. She gave us those experiences because she probably thought that we needed to comfort our own confidence. Otherwise, we would just be washed away. It was a lot of compassion that she gave us these things.
