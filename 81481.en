Amazing. Well, the pujas... Shri Mataji got involved in everything. For the early pujas, we didn't know anything. If Sattva wasn't there—if you listen to some of the early tapes—there are hours of rustling noises and little commands from Shri Mataji saying, "Just get that thing there," "Get this thing," "Now do this," and "Now do that." We just had no idea.

On one occasion at the Finchley Road ashram, there was no one who could read Sanskrit at all. For something we were doing, we were outside—do you remember?—in that beautiful back garden. We looked through everyone that was there, and in the end, Shri Mataji said, "Well, there's nothing for it. I'll just have to worship myself." And so she read the names.

By the way, going back to Nepal, do you remember the result of your flying around Everest? Oh, poor Pat. I got into one of my big sulks there. We wanted to go and see the Himalayas, so we got on a little local plane to look at the Himalayas and Mount Everest—a tourist trip. It flew down one side, miles away from the mountains, and I was on that side. Then it turned around and came back really close on the other side. So all the people on the right-hand side had an amazing view, and I didn't. I was so upset.

I went and asked the pilot if I could come up to the front to see it, but I was so angry, I refused. Then, when we got back, Shri Mataji signed my certificate to cheer me up, because she hadn't come with us. We each got a certificate to say we'd flown around Everest or something silly, and then she signed mine.

"Have you got the certificate still?"

"Yeah, it's something they gave to everyone who went on that flight. It's a picture of the Himalayas, a long, wide range."

But then we had the picnic. Oh, the picnic. Before that, there's something else I'd like to add. The next day, when we went into the garden, we saw these rather strange ripples in the sky. It was like when somebody throws a stone in a pond and you get ripples flowing out. Well, the sky was rippled like that; the clouds were like ripples. And Mother said to us, "Oh, yes, that's because you went to pay your respects to the Himalayas. It's the waves of joy coming from the mountains." I was too busy sulking.

In the garden also, she was combing the nits out of her hair that she'd caught from me, that I'd caught from the train. We had to kill them and take the name of a bhoot each time.

But that picnic, yes, we went to the foothills. We went up to the foothills outside to have a picnic and we wandered up. We were going to see some sadhu or something. No, we found a spot, and then somebody told us that there was a hermitage nearby where a sadhu lived. So we all thought we'd go there, and Shri Mataji must have gone along with it. We went there, but he wasn't in. There was a hermitage, like a lot of stuff in Nepal—carved wood and everything. He wasn't there, but we could feel some vibrations. He was realized.

So we all got very excited. We had our picnic and were all jumping up and down, hoping that this great yogi would appear and this huge cosmic event would take place. And then he actually turned up. As Fergie would say, looking just like in the comics, with his hair taken up and everything. A long conversation took place between him, Shri Mataji, and Gregoire's servant—Tej, was it? Yeah, something like that.

Anyway, I thought, "This is going on rather long. This discussion doesn't look terribly cosmic." Then the Nepalese servant looked at us, and I thought, "Uh-oh." The next thing we knew, the sadhu was sitting on the ground, and Shri Mataji had her foot on his back and was trying to clear him out. She said he was a realized soul, but he'd gone mad in the Kali Yuga on his own.

That went on for a while. When we went to leave, all these kids gradually appeared from all around. As we were leaving, it was discovered that Shri Mataji's purse had been stolen by somebody.

"A handbag, yeah?"

"No, the purse. Mother always called it a purse."

"Oh, well, whatever."

Someone had stolen the purse, and some of the locals immediately set off to try and find it. So we went and sat in the car, and we could see it all being played out on the mountainside. There was this posse of people, and they'd go up the mountain and into a house for a few seconds. Then they'd come out, and the line of people had gotten a bit longer. At each house, more people would join. It went all over the place until eventually, they found it. Gregoire was horrified that it had happened on his watch.

Well, it wasn't just that. When she got the purse back, she gave a reward to the people that brought it. She had all the kids stand in a line, and as each one came up to her, she gave the child realisation and one rupee. A certain person among our number said, "Shri Mataji, you cannot pay people to get realisation."

And Shri Mataji said, "I'm the Adi Shakti. I can do anything I like."

Well, that was very, very interesting. We move on now...
