Jai Shri Mataji, Prem Kumar. Very nice of you to meet us and have Shri Mataji's Cabella castle in the backdrop and live from there. Thank you so much. We begin with asking about how did your journey begin? Where did you hear about Shri Mataji first and how did you get your realization?

I got my self-realization in 1988. I saw Shri Mataji's poster in front of my university, Warsaw Technical University, Faculty of Architecture. The photo of Shri Mataji was just on the door to the entrance to the Faculty of Architecture. It was May, and it was like an exam session, so I was very tense about exams. I was always getting peace looking at Shri Mataji's photo on the doors. After some time, I started spontaneously rising energy in front of her, and I felt so cool. My brain was so clean from all those problems around, and I could manage to pass my exams pretty well. It was surprising, and I was thanking Shri Mataji for that.

Her smile and her energy were felt. I really felt it. I felt that she's not from this earth. She's a really divine person. Sometimes I would just bow to her, pray for good exams, and then go inside the building.

Lovely. So you were at that point a student of architecture?

Yes. In Warsaw. It was my third year of architecture.

And this is May 1988. This whole amazing experience you had was just from the photo of Shri Mataji. What was it like when you saw her first, when you met her?

Oh, I met her after some time because I used to travel a lot. I used to go to Italy, to many places all over the world, doing my art. I was more into art than architecture. Actually, I was into both art and architecture. So I think I met her in 1989 or 1990 for the first time.

When I came to her, I bowed to her and just put my hands towards her. I looked at her eyes and I really felt the same thing: she's a divine person. It's such an amazing feeling. I was completely lost. Then she called me and she said, "Come, come." She grabbed my hand, closed her eyes, and said, "Oh, you are an artist." I said, "Yes." Then she said, "You are also an architect." I said, "Yes." I was really having proof that she knows everything.

Then she said a very interesting sentence: "You will stay with me. You will stay with me and you will work for me." I just could not believe it. I was just bowing. I was not thinking it was going to happen, but from afar, I could see she was holding out her hand to me. And she said, "Yes, yes. You will stay with me. You will stay with me." Then I just bowed and I left, and I could never imagine that I would be really near her again.

Where was this incident?

It was in Warsaw. Shri Mataji used to come on August 12th, almost every year. It was my birthday also, and it was amazing. I felt it was a gift of God to have Shri Mataji's blessing on my birthday. I believe it was August 12th, 1989 or 1990. I don't remember now because many years have passed, but I remember this conversation with her very well.

Wow. I mean, what a gift to have Shri Mataji telling you that you will be with her and work for her. Tell us what your first project with Shri Mataji was, or how did you work for Shri Mataji? What did that mean?

So, let's start from the beginning. Next year, I think it was '92. I came for Adi Shakti Puja to Cabella. At that time, there was a tent near the river down below. I just came for Puja, and some yogis said, "Just come and stay for Puja, and we'll go back to Poland." So I said, okay, let's go for Puja.

After the Puja, the bus was ready to go. My luggage was in the bus. Then suddenly, someone from the castle—maybe it was an architect, I don't remember exactly—started shouting at the entrance to the hangar, to the tent: "Architect from Poland! Architect from Poland! Architect from Poland!" Everybody was looking, "Who is this architect?" I thought, maybe it's me. I don't know. But anyway, he said, "Yeah, it's you."

I went up and we came to the castle. That was my first meeting with Shri Mataji there, and it was an amazing, very intensive experience. I entered the kitchen and saw for the first time Indian ladies cooking for Shri Mataji, and the smell of delicious food. Then I went into the dining area, where there was a fragrance of flowers. It was an unearthly feeling. I had absolutely never experienced this kind of divine atmosphere.

Then they asked me to enter the big room just behind me. I saw the frescoes, the art, and a lot of flowers, but I still could not see Shri Mataji. Anyway, I already felt I was in heaven.

Is that the photograph?

Yes, it is, just from that time. I was a young student and a young, little bit lost person. Yes, that was exactly the time.

And when I reached Shri Mataji's bedroom, I saw her sitting and smiling. She said, "Come, come to me." Then she started holding my hands and working on me. She started speaking to me about Poland, how Poland suffered during the war. She talked a lot about the resurrection of Poland after the war. Then she focused on me, on my left side, how much I suffered in previous lives. And she said, "Now you don't need to suffer anymore. You are in the kingdom of God. You will be here. You will stay with me here."

I could not believe it. I was still a young student, and I was thinking, where is my luggage? It's in the bus, and I was supposed to go back to Poland.

After some time, Shri Mataji was still holding my hand, and then leaders came from all over the world and she started talking to them. So I thought maybe I was not needed in that place, and I started slowly moving my hand. But she suddenly clutched and grabbed it again. I thought, okay, I have to surrender.

Then I went down to the hangar, to the tent, and there was no more bus. My luggage was on the street. And that's how the journey began.

Amazing. Now, in that photo is the backdrop of the castle. And where you are is actually the castle as it is now. So would you like to talk about your experiences with Shri Mataji in transforming this dilapidated building into what it is now?

Yeah, it was the tremendous work of Shri Mataji, the Golden Builders, and all those who were involved in that project. It was a great resurrection from ruins into the most beautiful and most vibrated place on earth. She was there all the time, coordinating with architects—not yet with me. She asked me to do art and some help, but at that time, there were other builders and architects who were coordinating everything with Shri Mataji.

Myself, I was mostly doing art and some decoration. Later on, I started doing wood carving in Shri Mataji's castle. So my job was more the artistic, decorative part. I did the decoration of the staircase and wood carving on the staircase with Ukrainian yogis. That was a more artistic approach at that time.

Very nice. I'm going to share this photo that you've emailed us before.

Oh yeah, we are sleeping on the floor. Yes.

Where is this then?

It was amazing. We were Polish, Ukrainian... there were French yogis also there. All nations were willing to help and work for Shri Mataji and get her blessing and cleansing. We were young, so there was no big deal to sleep on the floor. No, it's quite nice and quite relaxing, actually, to be in contact with Mother Earth. This is on the ground floor. It's when you enter now; behind the doors, there is a library, and in front, there is a meditation room. So it's the main hall entrance from below.

And here is Shri Mataji again. It seems she's going somewhere.

Oh yes. Every time she was going for tours to America, to Eastern Europe, Western Europe, South America, she used to go to that bridge, and we were allowed to get the darshan of Shri Mataji, offer her flowers, and sometimes get direct conversation with her in certain times and certain cases.

Do you have any memories from those times? Any interesting conversations or chats you'd like to share with us?

Yes. She used to always ask, "How do you feel? Better? You feel better?" She was always concerned about health and vibrations, the state of the chakras. She was always giving some attention, especially when we were giving flowers.

Amazing. That love and compassion of Shri Mataji is beyond words. Absolutely. And in this photo here, there are lots of Golden Builders, yogis.

Yes, there are Golden Builders. The tall guy to the right, that's me. And the rest of the guys are there with us. I can recognize Fergie there.

Who are the others, please?

One boy from Argentina, one boy from Germany, another boy from Germany, and one boy from Poland. They are all there.

And which year is this then?

It was 1992.

And here again?

We have yogis from the Czech Republic, Poland, Belarus, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and again, Poland. That's me. And behind, the divine power of Adi Shakti. Always with us.

What a blessing from Shri Mataji, really. Would you like to talk about this, please? There's Shri Mataji's sketch and there are your drawings.

Oh, that's an interesting story. This is from one of the next projects. We have jumped from 1992 to 1997. Until 1997, I was in Cabella, and in India for the wintertime and for the summertime in Cabella.

So, this is one of the projects where Shri Mataji decided to build a house in Gurgaon, in India. And she drew the first sketch. I'm sorry it's blurred; sometimes for social media, I didn't want to put too-clear drawings. But you can see the octagonal shape of the staircase, the rooms, the kitchen, and the drawing rooms. And then she used to write for whom: for her family members, for everyone, for the guests. Everybody got an associated room, and there was a small library, a small drawing room, and a pantry. It's a very beautiful design.

Then she asked me, "Prem Kumar, please, can you make an elevation for this house?" She said, "I'm giving to you the full design of the elevation for the house." So I went to my room and I thought, "Oh my God, what do I have to do?" I knew Shri Mataji likes classical Indian architecture, and we had talked many times before about certain architectural elements. So I gathered all the information from previous conversations with Shri Mataji, and then I put myself into meditation. I said, "I don't do this drawing. It is you who is guiding me." And I drew that drawing, which is labeled "Prem Kumar drawings."

I went to her after a few days. I went to her room, she looked at this drawing of the elevation and also of the 3D view, and she said, "Yes, that's what I want." It was amazing. She was so happy. She grabbed my hands and said, "Yes, exactly what I want. And this is going to happen."

Again, I was always very shy. I said, "Okay, this is you, not me. It is you, Shri Mataji, not me. It is you, you are the creator. I'm just your instrument." Later on, the architects did the blueprints. And if you scroll down, the architects, builders, and the team, they built that house. Finally, on the right corner on the bottom, you can see the final building.

Yes, this is what it looks like.

Only they changed the staircase. Shri Mataji wanted the staircase of an octagonal shape on the right side, but because of the zone and codes in India, they put it on the left side. Otherwise, it's almost identical to the drawing which I had a chance to draw. But I knew it's not me; it is she who is doing it.

And when you were sketching and drawing these elevations, what were the conversations that Shri Mataji had previously with you that came to your attention, which you kept in mind about the shapes, the structures, the materials?

Yes. Previously, we did a few projects for Shri Mataji. We were working on the completion of the interiors of the Noida house. And we had a chance also to stay in Pratisthan. Though Pratisthan was built, Shri Mataji wanted to have additional buildings around it.

She gave me a lot of interesting information about the building materials as well as the shapes. She loved arches. She loved the architectural elements of very classical Indian architecture. Though not really a temple style, but mostly, I could say, it was a fusion of styles of, let's say, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Northern India, Taj Mahal, all together. It's not in one style; it's just all together, only one.

Okay, I'll stop sharing this. Thank you for the story of Pratisthan and the sketches that Shri Mataji herself drew. And based on that, you drew the elevations.

It's just based mostly on conversation with her. She drew many sketches. During conversations, sometimes she was visualizing, making quick sketches, and giving them to me to follow and evaluate them into proper artistic impressions.

The yogis, the Golden Builders, and other yogis who have worked on Shri Mataji's projects, houses, and others... they kept saying how Shri Mataji used to change things very quickly. How did you find that?

Actually, I didn't have that much experience. Usually, in my case, because I was also an artist, whatever she was explaining, I could catch it quick. It's not me; it was she. So whatever I drew, she really liked it. I know there were many changes, but she always had an intention to involve yogis in the process. In between, she was working on them. She was working on all of us. We came from very difficult backgrounds, and all of us had certain conditions from our countries, certain addictions, all kinds of things.

So sometimes, yes, she wanted to make it better, more beautiful, more interesting. It's true, it happened many times. For example, we did the garden project behind the castle, which has not been done yet. She changed her ideas many times, but finally, I think we came to a conclusion. It's a designing process. For me, it's a normal thing. I work full-time as a designer, so it's always a process of designing. Overnight, you sleep on it, and then the next day you change it, and then the next time again. For me, it's absolutely normal.

Fantastic. And I can see behind you the balcony, Shri Mataji's balcony of the castle. Are there any stories that you'd like to share from there?

From the balcony, there's an interesting story, but it's a little bit dramatic. I was just talking to one garden builder in the castle. He said, "You remember, Prem Kumar, in '97, you were working on the balcony? You got the ladder and you were supposed to paint Shri Mataji's frame and repair something on the windows and the shutters. And you didn't know that this ladder, when you unfold it, it's not properly settled and it may fall again." I was not aware of it. Some garden builders were aware of it, but in between, they were using better equipment somewhere else, so they gave me that ladder.

So when I put the ladder against Shri Mataji's window, just behind me on the balcony, I climbed it and started painting and cleaning the frames around the window. Suddenly, that ladder stretched back into its previous shape, and the window broke.

Actually, at the same time, Shri Mataji was there in the room. As usual in the afternoon, she was putting her Agnya against the sun. She was taking rest. She was just after the American tour and was very tired, very exhausted. And she was working on her back Agnya. Then I saw Shri Mataji, and I bowed to her. She went to her bedroom, and at that moment when she went to her bedroom, the ladder collapsed and broke the window. But she was safe; she was already in her bedroom.

So it was a pretty dramatic experience. But then very quickly, we cleaned all the glass, we fixed a new glass, and when Shri Mataji came again into the room, it was all fixed.

Which year is this?

'97. Before Ganesh Puja.

And Shri Mataji also talked about the project in the U.S. So simultaneously, she was focusing on India projects, on local projects here on the garden, the New Hangar, Daglio. And then in between, she said, "I just bought land in the U.S." And since I was also a U.S. green card holder, she said, "You will work there." It was an absolutely amazing experience to see how the divine was focusing on the entire world from that headquarters. It was an amazing experience to witness Shri Mataji working on the entire world.

Incredible. That's absolutely incredible. Now, let me share this photo here. Please share your memories about this.

Oh, yes. So that was in the Noida house. These are artistic impressions of houses. The first to the left is the Noida house. Shri Mataji was working there. When I arrived, we were working on the interiors there. The architect and builders, Indian builders and architects, were working on it, and Shri Mataji said, "You can stay there and work with them." It was a tremendous experience to work on the field with Indian architects and builders.

Shri Mataji, for example, designed the floors. She chose the colors of the walls and the stone on the walls, certain elements. There are many, many things done in that house. And then finally, when the house was ready, she did a very small havan inside. It was a tremendous experience to witness Shri Mataji doing a havan in the room.

The other house was done previously; it's in Qutub Enclave in Delhi. And down below, there is Pratisthan. So these are just illustrations. Once I was working and staying in those houses, I spent my spare time painting. So simultaneously, I was working for her in different ways: painting windows, doing wood carving, architecture, all kinds of works. And in my spare time, always painting, always painting.

What is Shri Mataji pointing at there in that photograph?

Oh, that's another story. There's a big dome on the top of the building in the Noida house, which is actually the first door to the left. You can see on the top, there is a kind of dome. And there was an opening inside the house; according to Indian regulations, there has to be some opening between the floors. She pointed at that space and said she wanted to put all the chakras, like a mural with carvings and beautiful artistic decoration between all those floors, up to the sky. Starting from Shri Ganesha, Saraswati, Lakshmi, Durga, Krishna, and all the deities. Through the whole house, she wanted all the chakras. She was pointing out, "If you can design and do this." So I did some drawings—we don't have them in this PowerPoint presentation, but I can show you next time. And then the architects and builders fixed it.

You can see behind Shri Mataji there are statues of all the deities. She always asked to put statues of deities as a decoration in her houses. She was always decorating houses with statues of Shri Ganesha, with deities, with beautiful carvings from South India, beautiful carvings from all over, from very special places near Madras. And she knew from where all these materials and carvings would come from, from all over India.

She pointed out that it should be as a decoration. She said, "Don't worship on the altar. I am everything." She said she is Adi Shakti, she is everything. She is Ganesha, she is all. "So why do you have to put a statue on my altar?" That's what she was saying at the time.

Beautiful. Were there any kind of wood, or marble, or stone that you think were used in all or most of these buildings?

Oh, that's a very interesting question. A very nice question, because even in the U.S. she used that same stone. She liked white marble and pink marble very much, sometimes a combination of pink and white marble. And she covered most of these houses with stones or some kind of ceramic, but everything was a part of the earth element. And it really had vibrations.

Sometimes she would ask, "Do you see the vibrations of that piece of marble, of that piece of terracotta, of those clay elements?" Some of them were from the Yamuna River, from the Ganga River. It was very important for her where all these building materials were coming from. And that's why they were so full of vibrations.

But I will tell you a very interesting story. She said once that all these materials from Mother Earth and from very special places like Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Yamuna, Ganga—all these places—she said that these special materials made out of Mother Earth were giving her a cooling bandhan. That, in addition to the Golden Builders, these special materials were giving a bandhan to her. So I said, "Wow, it's amazing." The divine also needs us as we need her. It felt like we are one body, protecting each other. It was an amazing statement from Adi Shakti. She said, "It's a bandhan for me."

Even the stone you can see behind her, she wanted to cover all the walls with a special shiny copper stone. It's a kind of slab, nicely cut. Some of them were gray, some of them were a copper color. In some rooms, it was a copper color, and in some rooms it was a grayish color, like silverish gray.

And what was it like then in Cabella? Because obviously it was too far to transport so many materials from there.

In Cabella, we had local materials because Cabella was a different construction. This was just remodeling. The castle was based mostly on Italian elements, which also had nice vibrations. But mostly we were working in India on very special, vibrated materials. She really loved India. She was very much concerned about India. She said to me, "You know, Prem, India is the best place. And I want you to stay and settle in India." She was so sweet. She invited me to all her houses and gave me so much love and her motherly, divine attention. It was beyond imagination, beyond even words.

Any particular incident that you could share from these visits in India, in Shri Mataji's various places in Pratisthan, in Gurgaon, in Noida?

Oh, there are many. But when I look at the picture and I see those big windows behind me, I'll tell you this story. Behind me is the bedroom of Shri Mataji. So mostly we had conversations about architecture in her bedroom. Usually, in the morning, she was taking tea. Sometimes she'd say, "Do you want to take tea?" I'd say, "No, thank you, Shri Mataji, I've had it." She was extremely gentle and kind.

We were working on some project, I think in Haryana or Gurgaon or whatever. I don't remember now. But suddenly, Shri Mataji became silent and she looked through the window. She looked at the sky and there was a sunset over the mountains. I looked at Shri Mataji, how happy she was looking through the window. And then she looked at me and she said, "Prem Kumar, do you see how big the windows are in my bedroom, in this house? In medieval times, in ancient times, there was never an idea in construction to have such big windows." And I said, "Shri Mataji, it was built for you. That's why there are big windows." And she said, "Yes, Prem Kumar, it was built for me."

Amazing. Yes, it was already built for Shri Mataji a long time ago. It reminds one of how the scriptures had predicted about Shri Mataji and Sahaja Yogis and the times with Shri Mataji. Also in England, William Blake and his paintings... yes, it's great to hear there was this castle as well, which was built before its time because they knew who it was for, that special person or supreme being who would live there, Shri Mataji herself.

Let me share the photos again... How about this story?

This painting is a nice story. It's a painting from Nargol. In 1995, there was a puja in Nargol. I went there; Shri Mataji was not there, but I really had a desire to go to Nargol. It was the first puja in 1995 in Nargol, and I painted this. It was just a wonderful experience to be in India for the Sahasrara Puja.

Then I went back to Cabella for Guru Puja in '95. When I arrived, I saw there was a big art exhibition in the hangar just to show Shri Mataji. Before the hangar, there were many beautiful paintings, but I arrived late. So I asked, "Where can I hang my paintings? I have paintings from India." They said, "We don't have any space for you. Oh, there is one space. There is the bathroom and the path where Shri Mataji usually doesn't pass. You can hang it near Shri Mataji's bathroom." There was like a gray corner. So I hung my paintings there. Anyway, I was happy that I could offer something to Shri Mataji.

When Shri Mataji arrived for Guru Puja, usually she takes a path that is very decorated with flowers. But somehow she turned to the side and she went to that path where my paintings were. She looked at them and she said, "I want to see Prem Kumar after the puja." I don't know why she knew it was my painting, but she did.

It was a wonderful puja, full of bliss, especially after India. At that time, India was a wonderful place. For a young person, it was an amazing experience to stay in India, for a 20-year-old boy. Then after the puja, I brought all my paintings and I put them in front of her. She looked at them and she corrected some of them. She said, "You have to improve your style." But then she noticed this painting, this particular painting. And she said, "Where did you paint this?" I said, "I painted it in Nargol, Shri Mataji."

And she looked at me. I felt it from the vibrations. "You know, I opened Sahasrara there," she said it very humbly, very softly. I looked at her. Oh my God. She's so divine. She's so beyond imagination. I just bowed to her. And she was happy about this painting. She said it was a good painting, and the vibrations were good. Though many other paintings she was criticizing with pretty good critiques.

I think I've moved to this painting of yours of Shri Ganesha at Cabella.

Oh, now we come back to '92.

Oh, this is 1992? Remind us when you painted the previous painting of Nargol, which year was that?

And this painting we're seeing now was painted in 1992. Yes, we were working on carvings, and after the carvings, we were painting windows, many things. But in between, we always had siesta time. So on siesta, I used to go to the river and create some art. I was thinking of offering Shri Mataji this Ganesha. I felt a lot of vibrations all over the area. It was amazing and very inspiring for creativity.

I had a vision that I would paint Shri Ganesha, the puja at Shri Mataji's feet, with the castle where she resides behind, and then the three channels and Sahasrara above. I just put that vision onto paper. I painted it with watercolors, using water directly from the river.

Then before leaving for Poland to finish my education, I offered it to Shri Mataji. I left it for her as a present. She looked at it and she was very happy. But the story doesn't end there. When I came next year for Sahasrara Puja in 1993, one of Shri Mataji's assistants came to me. "Prem Kumar, I have to tell you something." I said, "What happened?" He said, "I don't know what you are, but Shri Mataji asked for this painting to be put in front of her chair on another chair. She used to look at this painting for a long time. She kept it for many days. Sometimes she used to watch TV or do other errands, but she was watching your painting."

I said, "Oh, that's really a blessing." To be under such attention of God. I just could not even understand it. I could not comprehend it. They were saying Shri Mataji is working on Poland. She had compassion for a struggling artist. Everyone has a different opinion about me; I respect their opinion. But God's opinion is the most important.

What is the medium that you use? Is it watercolor? It's very rich. I mean, how did you get the colors so bright?

It's watercolor. Usually in universities or architectural institutes, they teach us to put a maximum of three thin layers. But I felt like I should put more color into it, more intensive pigment. Later on, Shri Mataji used to comment on my painting. She said, "You know, add black color even." I said, "Why?" They taught us in school that you cannot use black color in watercolor because it's not the way we paint. But she was breaking all the rules. She said, "Add more pigment, add black to colors, make it more intensive." So that's why my watercolors are not real watercolors. It's breaking all the rules and regulations.

So that's the finished product of Lakshmi and Vishnu. Beautiful.

It was '92. We have the work of Ukrainian yogis, the geometrical, floral patterns here. There are more. We can show more next time.

And this is how the castle looks now. This is a more recent painting of yours?

No, it's 1997. It is my last painting of the castle. And that's another story. Behind all these paintings, there's some story.

Okay, what's the story here?

Very interesting story. During the siesta, it was almost the end of the remodeling of the facade and painting it white. It's actually not paint; it's powdered marble applied on the elevation of the castle. The scaffolds were partially removed. So I went down during the siesta to paint it, as usual near the river.

I extended my time maybe till 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. It was almost sunset. I added my zoom lens to my camera and I zoomed in on the castle, and I saw Shri Mataji sitting on the top floor. I felt I had to go fast. I had a gut feeling that I had to really run. So I ran upstairs, and on the scaffolds, the Golden Builders were calling, "Prem Kumar, Shri Mataji is looking for you! You have to go up to that room."

In fact, Shri Mataji was in that room where I could see her from my zoom camera. She said, "Prem Kumar, where have you been? I'm looking for you." She was a little bit... I cannot say Mother was annoyed, but she was concerned. I said, "Shri Mataji, I was painting your house."

She said, "Prem Kumar, please, I have better plans for you than painting my house. Please don't do that. We have so many important projects in India. We have so many things. And if you want to paint, start painting abstract. Start painting things. Don't only do small things like painting my house. Do something more sophisticated."

So that was my last ever painting of the castle, in 1997, because Shri Mataji told me, "Just paint abstract, do your work, do architecture, do interior design." She said, "I want more for you than you can even imagine. Your future is not to paint my house." That's for sure.

Was there any time when Shri Mataji was upset with you?

Oh, yes. Many times. And I'm very glad that she has given me so many pakads, because without that, I would not grow. Only a loving mother can really shout one day and another day give you a present, another day give you a job, and another day give you her love and attention. At that time, it was pretty intensive, and I really felt completely devastated inside myself. I felt so useless. But after two or three days, she used to call and give me something, like a small present, a small watch or a small briefcase or something, just to... She was grooming and protecting me and all of us. It's not personal. We all experienced this kind of love from Shri Mataji here in the castle and also in India.

We heard from yogis how Shri Mataji, the amount of love, care, affection, compassion she showered her children with in her physical form in the early days is absolutely amazing.

Yes. You would be thinking it's the end of the world. I felt so useless. I did such silly mistakes and I shouldn't have done that. I felt so bad, so guilty. But then she didn't want us to be guilty. She wanted us to progress. So she knew how to care for her children. Many yogis have similar experiences.

Some yogis have shared how, when Shri Mataji told them off, she shouted so loud, but it felt so good because the negativity was done away with. Tell us from your experience with this close proximity to Shri Mataji, what are the things that please her? And what are the things that one should avoid?

She wanted us to give up all our conditions, our addictions, our previous lifestyles, our country's conditions, our mentality, our overthinking, our likes or dislikes. She just wanted to remove it fully. She wanted us to be excellent.

Sometimes I used to go down to the village to go to a bar or somewhere, and coming back, they told me, "Shri Mataji wants to see you." And then she asked me, "Where have you been? I'm working so hard on you." Sometimes Ukrainian and Polish yogis used to go shopping in Genoa or Milan and come back, and she was so concerned. She was shouting, "Why did you go to those places? I'm working on you so hard to remove all these problems from you, from your country, and then you just go shopping to buy a Walkman or some kind of gadget." She didn't like that.

She was very much concerned about our condition. She didn't want that. From my experience, whenever I was going back to my old previous conditions, addictions, or anything, she could see it in a second. In a second, she could see. "Oh, Prem Kumar, why didn't you check vibrations? Be in vibratory awareness, always. Why are you making such mistakes?"

She was so concerned. She could shout and then be like, "It's okay, it's fine." And the moment when she was shouting, yes, it was full bliss. From one side, your heart was crying inside, but on the other hand, your Sahasrara was completely open. It was bliss and sorrow at the same time.

Is there any other memory that you want to share from Cabella or India that comes to your attention?

A very interesting story. Early in '93 or '94... In '92, I told Shri Mataji I have a green card. So she called America and other places, and she said to the architects and artists, "Can we work together?" But they were busy with other projects, so there was not much opportunity at that time. Then she said, "You know, Prem Kumar, I have an idea." She called India, to an architect in India, and she asked him if I could work with him. He said, "Yes, obviously. Let him come."

So we came with Shri Mataji. She introduced me to the architects. We worked on this project in Noida and many other things. After six months, my visa in India was finished, and I had no ticket back. Also, my old ticket from December was not valid. It was a very interesting story. I used to go to Alitalia in Delhi to ask them for help to go back. They said, "Absolutely no way you can go with an invalid ticket back to Italy. You will not get the ticket."

So some yogi told me, "Just write a letter to the main headquarters of Alitalia with a request and an explanation." So I wrote everything. I applied and went through the whole bureaucratic system, but still they said, "No, we can't help you."

Every day I used to go and stay for many hours at Alitalia in Delhi. Once, an officer came and he said, "Okay, I will call Italy. If Italy says you are good to go, we will issue the ticket. But only the Italians can decide." So, here I am in India, talking to Italy, at the Alitalia headquarters in Connaught Place.

He called Italy, and someone in Italy answered. They didn't even want to talk. He said, "There is someone who wants to go back to Italy." And from the Italian side, they said, "Yeah, okay, let him go. No problem." They didn't even talk about it. They just said, "Yes, please issue it." That's it, finished.

So they told me, "Yeah, you got the ticket." I said, "Thank you so much." And they said, "No, don't thank anyone. Thank only God. It's God, because we didn't really want to help you. We didn't do anything. It's only God who helped you."

So I was very happy. I went to the airport and I saw many yogis there. And what happened was, actually, Shri Mataji was going on the same flight, the same airplane to Milan. When I came to passport control, Shri Mataji was in front of me. Yogi Mahajan looked at me and said, "What are you doing, Prem?" I said, "I'm going to Milan." He immediately came over, and I explained to him that I got this ticket for free, and it's a miracle. Right away, he went to Shri Mataji and said, "Prem Kumar is going with you! It's a miracle!" And then Shri Mataji came and she said, "It's not a miracle. Welcome to Sahaja Yoga. It's never a miracle. It's a normal thing in Sahaja Yoga."

And then we went there, and the journey with Shri Mataji was still going on.

That is so true. It's such a beautiful story you've shared. And I'd like to thank you on behalf of all of us for joining us for this interview today.

I also want to thank you. I want to thank all those yogis who were working together on the house. I want to thank all the yogis who were working on architectural projects in India: the architects, the Golden Builders. I want to thank them for even the hard lessons they were giving me to make me who I am now. And most, most, most thank you to Shri Mataji for all the blessings she has given to us in this most powerful time of her reincarnation on this earth.

Jai Shri Mataji again and again.

Jai Shri Mataji.
