So, here we are at Ashley Gardens, number 56. Mother's flat was on the very top, wasn't it? We went up in the lift. Do you remember, Dougie, all the work that was done here?

Oh, yeah, I can remember several times. One time in particular, I came here when Mother was away, and I came with a bunch of flowers. I said to Mr. Seedby, "Mother's coming back today, so will you take these to make sure there are flowers in the house?"

Another rather funny thing that happened with me, which I thought was strange at the time, was I bought some orchids, some slipper orchids, and I gave them to Mother because I thought they were really, really nice. I gave them to her, and she said, "Oh, yes, go and put them in the toilet." And I felt a little bit disappointed at that. But then two weeks later when I came there, they were still in the toilet. So obviously Mother knew something that I didn't. It was the right place for them to be. The right place for everything to be. Yeah, quite incredible. Amazing.

Did you do any work on it, Pat? No, I didn't.

One of the things I remember most, or two things, is I got two really nice, ornamental bits of brass work from Shri Mataji here. She found out it was my birthday, and she just plucked something off the mantelpiece and gave it to me. And another time, I was feeling a bit sorry for myself, I think, and she just picked something else up and gave it to me. And I've got both of them.

Was it here that she did the hoops? The bangles? Hang them on your ears? I can't remember. I'm not sure.

But we used to come here after meetings at Caxton Hall. Mother would invite us back from Caxton Hall and give us some food, didn't she?

Yeah, she often did. Even the new people? Even new people. People would come over from Caxton Hall, and we'd all go up there for a while. Yes, definitely. Many, many times.

And then you had your wedding. Well, even before that, we would stay here. At one point, when we were still at Finchley Road Ashram, to clear me out, Mother said I had to leave the ashram, and I was feeling particularly sorry for myself. I said to Mother, "So I have to go then?" And she said, "Yes, you have to go." She nipped over beside me and said, "We have to keep saying it like this, so that the negativity feels that you're gone." And then she nipped back in front of me and said, "So you'll be going then?" And I just said, "Yes, of course." Because I felt completely that Mother was with me. It wasn't that I was being sent away; it was that the negativity had to believe I was out, so that it would leave me alone.

And then when we went, we had our first year at Sands, do you remember? There was a wedding at Caxton Hall. Dollis Hill, wasn't it? Yes, it was a wedding party in Dollis Hill. We all got invited. No idea whose wedding it was. We were all at Dollis Hill, and it went on till midnight. That was one of the times at Dollis Hill, in NW10, just around the corner from the tube.

Like Pat said, for as long as I can remember, every Monday, Mother would be in Caxton Hall, which is just a walk, really. Sometimes she would go into a McDonald's and have a fillet of fish and a Diet Coke, or sometimes she'd send someone out, and they would come back festooned with McDonald's. We were sort of amazed that the Adi Shakti would eat McDonald's and drink Diet Coke from a straw.

One of my enduring memories is Mother saying she used to watch out of the window to the Cathedral School there and watch the delivery lorries delivering casks and casks of beer and cases of whiskey for all the priests. For the Cathedral. She was absolutely amazed that this was supposedly God's house, and it was just like a pub, really.

It was lovely, really comfortable. I remember as we used to walk into the hall, the big wooden Ganesha was there. He was always there, and that one came to Dollis Hill. We took it to Dollis Hill, and I remember scrubbing him down, putting him in the bath, and scrubbing all the kumkum off him to make him clean.

And we did spend our wedding night here. Before that, you have to remember after that wedding in Dollis Hill, Mother gave us a lift because all the buses had stopped. That's right. When we got out of the car here. That's right, and we had our first-year college exams the next day. Mother said, "Would you like to come in?" And Maureen said, "Oh, we have exams tomorrow." She said, "Oh, you'd better go then." So we went. She said, "So you came to the wedding even so." That's right. And she said, "Don't worry, you'll be all right. Don't worry, you'll be fine." And we were, eventually.

A little while after that, we were married and spent our wedding night here. There were two weddings going on, and the other family just whisked their couple away. Mother said, "So you two, what are you doing?" And we just didn't know. We just looked at each other. "We don't know." She said, "Come with me."

So we drove through London from Hampstead. We actually saw the dean of our faculty in the street, and we were all dressed as Indians. I had the massive turban on, which was made from Mother's sari, and one of Mother's brooches there. We were still tied together with the scarf, sitting in the back, and Mother was in the front. We just saw this guy, and it was so surreal, the fact that this intellectual fool just didn't know what was driving past him.

Then we came here, and Mother showed us into a room. We went there and we just sat there on the bed, still tied together. We sat on the bed for what must have been two or three hours, and we eventually sort of crept out. We could hear some sort of noise, and Mother was in the lounge watching the telly. It was a Bette Davis film. And Mother said, "You must watch this, she's really good." She's a very good actress, a very good part. And she said, "Oh, no need for this." So she untied us, because we were still tied together with the scarf.

The next morning, we had breakfast with Sir C.P., and she told him they'd been married. He was very pleased. He said, "Oh, thank you for staying. It's very auspicious to have you here." And then on that day, we went to pick the keys up for the ashram in Stockwell. Charlton Road, yes, because Mother said it was auspicious for a newly married couple. So we went there, and we were the first people in there when it was ours.

There's a central lift there that goes all the way up. And one day, I came to see Shri Mataji, and the lift came down, and the doors opened, and I realized I was looking at Mother below my eyesight. It was the first time in the several years I had known her, because she always seemed so immense. It was the only time in my life I ever realized that. It's extraordinary.

But you'd go up in the lift, and then turn, and the flat was that way, wasn't it? You came out on that side. Then you'd go into the entrance, and you spent ages painting that frame over the radiator, didn't you? She put grills over all the radiators to hide them, with a nice shelf and ornaments on everything. Douglas, I can remember you painting.

I did. I actually did spend quite a lot of time in there, doing bits and pieces. I remember, as you go in the hall, you go through the door, and on the right, there's a large double cupboard with two mirrors on it. The outside of the mirrors was decorated with hand-carved woodwork from India. She gave me all these pieces of woodwork to put on, and of course, I sort of fiddled around with them for a little bit. Then I realized that there was just enough to go around these cupboards. It was quite amazing. So I decorated the outside of these cupboards, and then I went out and bought some glass mirrors. We put two huge glass mirrors on it. It was a coat cupboard, so when people came out, they could see what they looked like.

Next to the cupboard, there was always a Ganesha, because I remember C.P. used to touch his feet when he'd go out. It was a big, dark wooden carved one. The one that was at... because that went to Dollis Hill. It was upstairs. Well, I remember washing him in the bath in Dollis Hill upstairs. Big, beautiful, not quite ebony, but very dark wood.

And Mother, actually in here, gave me a Ganesha which I've still got, a tiny little jade Ganesha. She said, "There, it's broken, you might fix him." Where his hand is like that, the hand was broken off. So I got some superglue. I've never had superglue work before, but it worked, and it's still there. Thirty years later. And he's still on the altar.

Inside, the house was always the same. It was very lush, wasn't it? It was comfortable. Beautiful embroidered carpets laid everywhere all over the floor. She'd always get nice chandeliers. Yes, always. Lots of ornaments. And there was always light. The furniture was quite ornate, and there were glass doors that could have opened out onto the staircase. There was the long dining room and the long living room, both on the front. They were quite beautiful.

Mother's bedroom was the first bedroom down the end of the passageway. And do you remember in the passageway, Mother made false ceilings? To put all the luggage and the sort of things she needed to put away. She did that quite often. She said it was a waste of space in some areas, so she'd make a false ceiling and create a space to store stuff.

And do you remember the kitchen? We went down to that place to see those people who were supposedly all spiritualists. Mother went in the kitchen and she made sandwiches for all of us to take with us, because we'd been invited by that guy who came to the meetings. We were all terrified, and Mother said, "Right, you've got to be really prepared for this. These spiritualists, they're working with spirits and all this." And we went down there, and they all turned out to be realized, and they were all amazing. We had a wonderful time.

I was just remembering how we would come here sometimes, and especially the girls were privileged, in that they would get to sleep in Shri Mataji's bedroom. I can remember one incident like that, where another yogini and myself were there, and Shri Mataji said, "Lie down on the bed, lie down. Let's sleep now, sleep now." This other yogini was laid on one side, and Shri Mataji apologized to me because she said she always sleeps on her right side. So she had her back to me. I said, "Really, that's fine." And I lay down.

After a while, she said, "Irene, are you there?" I said, "Yes." She said, "Where are you?" Because I didn't dare cuddle up to her. And I was just, "I'm here, Mother." She said, "Where are you?" I sort of inched a bit nearer, and just lay there and relaxed. But I just couldn't let go to the fact that it was okay to be in such a space. Later, in India, we heard how if anybody laid on Shri Mataji's bed who was unauthorized, they'd be thrown off the bed by the deities. So I must have been a bit aware that what I was doing was a little bit... there's a few fierce deities about there. It was as if I was growing up a tiny bit and stopped feeling like the little baby that could do whatever.

When Shri Mataji said we should do a big public program, we looked everywhere. I can't remember who found Caxton Hall as the right place, but we told Mother, and she said to go ahead. The great thing about Caxton Hall is it had many different rooms in it. Do you remember the names of them, Pat? The only one I can definitely remember is the Great Hall. About once a month, we'd get the Great Hall and do a big public program.

We actually advertised the very first one in Time Out. It was quite a fair-sized hall, the one on the right. We made such a mess of it that Bogdan said the only reason he came was he thought that anyone who made such a mess of an advert must be regular people and not publicity types.

Do you remember buying all those plates in Oxford Street? Mother bought a load of, I think it was Crown Derby china, in Oxford Street. I think it was a sale at Selfridges. My mother used to shop a lot in the Army & Navy as well, didn't she?

I remember going shopping in Oxford Street with Mother when I had something wrong with my eyes. She said I just had to follow her with one hand out and one hand down. I had to keep shutting my eyes because they were all gone pink. It was my liver working out. So we'd just be wandering around with her buying things. There was also that shop, the India tea shop, where she would always buy prestige tea. On Oxford Street. The prestige tea, yes. It always made tea completely different.

They started in October 1977, and they must have gone on for several years. When Mother went to India, she'd go for about three months, from January to March, so obviously they'd stop. We never did meetings without Mother. We weren't really at that point. We just survived for three months, except for the time, obviously, when we went with her.

We came every single Monday. It was just a fixed event. As I say, once a month we'd have the Great Hall and have a big meeting and do another big publicity drive. It would always be packed, absolutely packed. Mother would see everybody in the hall. She'd give a talk.

There was one day when Gregoire decided that he would announce who Shri Mataji was. He gave the big talk. And Mother, in her own way, paused and very slowly he pronounced her to be the Adi Shakti. Mother said that it went over some people's heads one way and other people's heads the other way. It was all too much for them. We were expecting them all to go, "This is it, we've found her!" But they were just sitting there as usual.

Even at one of the Caxton Hall meetings, some lady stood up and said that she was the Adi Shakti. Shri Mataji had been going around and seeing everybody in all the chairs, so it so happened she was standing in front of Mother when she said it. Shri Mataji just looked at her and said, "Really? I think you should go and do your own meetings." And she left. It's just extraordinary that people were so blind. They would come, they'd get their realization, they'd go. And then a new lot would come and get realization, and then a few would hang on.

This is Caxton Hall. This is sort of a fairly typical Victorian-built municipal building, which is in private hands now. This is where Mother used to have public meetings every Monday for years and years. And this is where I met Mother. Just after Easter of 1979, she came in, and it wasn't the Great Hall; it was one of the smaller halls. I was sitting at the front. Mother gave a talk, and she used to come and work on people individually. She came down and talked to everyone, asking, "Who's new?" and "Did you feel it?" and things like that.

I've met Maureen a while before, and she took me to meet Mother. Maureen was nervously standing behind me, saying, "This is him, Mother, this is him." And Mother said, "He's all right." And that was it. That was fine. That was as much approbation as I would ever need.

Caxton Hall is a magnificent building. It was quite well-known in the '60s especially because it was the registry office, so lots of celebrities—pop stars and film stars—were married then. You would always see them on the newsreels coming out of Caxton Hall.

This was my first real experience of public meetings here. This was where we did the first ever public meeting. As Maureen said, once a month we used to have the Great Hall, which was the biggest one. It's like magnificent Victorian municipal architecture. All the rooms were wood-paneled with lovely parquet flooring. Mother loved that sort of thing, any of the quality build of things.

The meeting was quite amusing, really, because Mother would turn up around 7:00 or 7:30 and give her talk. Then she'd go around chatting to everybody. I remember the old guy, the caretaker that was there, he'd start turning the lights off at about half past ten. Mother would just sort of carry on and take no notice. Eventually, he got used to the way we went, because Mother didn't stop until she was finished. He waited for her. Quite often she'd work on all the new people, so she wouldn't go until the job was finished.

One time there was a demonstration by the National Front outside the hall. Mother said, "Oh, don't worry. When the fox wants to die, it comes to the town." And that started the demise of the National Front. They gradually sort of... we also had some politicians speaking one night in another hall, do you remember? We left our bag behind, and they had to call out the bomb squad to defuse it.

But that first public meeting was really awesome. I mean, Sahaja Yoga changed. It was incredible. In two hours, we went into the meeting, it was one thing; we came out and it was another. It was just a complete electric... It was like the lights got put on. I thought it was like changing gears, a whole new era. And you could feel it, couldn't you? It was just amazing.

There were these phases, weren't there? When we met Shri Mataji at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, it was like an introduction. From there, we went to Judd Street, and it was like a sort of germination, because one or two more people came in. After Judd Street, we went to North Gower Street. At North Gower Street, it started to take root. The roots started to grow. And then, coming to here, to Caxton Hall, was the plant starting to grow. It was starting to flower. That's what I think.

And then we had all these new seekers coming to see... Bogdan, Bala and all these people. Bogdan came for the first ever one, the first night. David Baxter got his realization here. He rang us up at the ashram about four days later and said, "Excuse me, how long does this bliss last?" I said, "What do you mean?" He said, "I can't do my job. I'm dissolving in bliss. What am I going to do?" He was a reporter. That was hilarious.

Here's the main entrance where we stood many a time waiting to see Shri Mataji off. Her car would be here. We'd all gather, and the poor caretaker would be there saying, "It's really time. I have to shut the door." And we'd still move another inch further forward. The whole pavement would be full of Sahaja Yogis. People would be wondering what the whole big deal was. Then Shri Mataji would be there in her car, and off she'd drive. And then we'd finally, reluctantly, go off to the Spaghetti House for our supper.

So it was from '77 to '83. Six years. That's a long time.

CP was often off on business, and Shri Mataji used to do national tours all the time. She went to my hometown, Middlesbrough. She went to Derby, Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds. She went to Leeds a lot. During the day, when she would stay overnight, she would go shopping. Someone filmed her shopping for crockery in Derby, because Derby's near Wedgwood and the potteries there in the North West Midlands. And there's film of her just going around this lovely crockery shop with lots of Sahaja Yogis following behind, just on the tail of a comet, really. She used to love that.

When she'd speak, she would speak about the area itself. My hometown's an industrial town. They discovered iron ore in the local hills, and it was effectively built on steel. Teesside and Sheffield were the two centers of the steel industry in England for a long time. So Mother came to Middlesbrough and gave a talk in the polytechnic there. She would drive around and ask about the locale where she was going to speak. I drove her around and across the Transporter Bridge, across the River Tees, which is a really lovely bridge. She asked me what the town was. I said it was built on steel.

We'd just had our third child, our second son, and he was only a few weeks old. We didn't have a name for him. I said, "Mother, can you name him?" She said, "What's this town built on?" I said, "Oh, it's built on steel, Mother." She said, "Oh, we'll call him Samarth, which is the man who was equal to his own name. And we'll call him Samson as well." So he's called Samarth Samson. It was beautiful. He was named in a steel town, so he's like a man of steel.

We all lived around this area before we met Shri Mataji. There was a large squatting community. I remember one of the second or third times I met Shri Mataji, which was just around the corner in North Gower Street. She was on her own; Gregoire was with her, and that was about all. With a whole room full of hippies all arguing about drugs. At one point, she just sort of hugged herself and went, "What can I do?" And I just thought, she's just like a mother with all these naughty children. So I thought, I'll just stop, see what happens. I stopped taking drugs and got a lot of dirty looks from all the others.

It was amazing how courageous she was. Coming from her background, the level of society she lived on, into a room... they were a very wild bunch around here. They really were. And she just took on the whole room of them. It was quite amazing.

Mother said in one of her talks that all the rubbish went into the foundations. But what you've got to remember is even if the rubbish goes into the foundations, it makes the foundations stronger, so it can support the whole of the building. So even those that sort of got passed aside would have done their bit in a way.

Why do you think people in those early days, some of them just didn't stick on? Well, they might have known, but they weren't prepared to believe. Or they were so into other things that to them it just seemed like another experience. There was peer pressure as well. I got quite a lot of stick about stopping taking drugs. People were very cynical. You go out, you go to a couple of parties, get a bit wasted, and you lose all the vibrations and you see it all differently.

It happened to me. I didn't make it the second week. I meant to, but I didn't. And then Shri Mataji asked after me because Maureen went. And she came back and said, "Oh, Shri Mataji asked where you were." I was quite touched. I thought, sweet of her to remember.

I remember that guy, that speed freak who threw the brick through the window. We were all sitting there with Shri Mataji, and this brick came flying through the window. Shri Mataji said, "Look, did you see the way it moved?" So it didn't hit anyone. It actually came straight through the window and then went like that. I knew who it was because he was shouting outside, so I leapt up in a fury and went pounding down the stairs to catch him and wring his neck. Afterwards, they told me Shri Mataji was putting bandhans on me that I wouldn't find him, so he wouldn't get hurt.

At that time, Shri Mataji said something like, "Don't worry, when I go, I shall pull in my net." Some of them were good people. Some of them were nice. They got lost again. But, who knows?

She'd talk to each one and find out what they'd been doing and what their background was, probing them, trying to find out what condition they were in. She'd always be horrified. She just said she couldn't believe so many people had become so damaged so young or had been through so much suffering so young. She meant suffering in a spiritual sense, just lost and frustrated and that kind of thing.

This is Judd Street. This is where I had my first meeting with Shri Mataji. I only came here once. Yes, I only came here once.

It was a huge thunderstorm the night before. It's amazing. So that's the last door I walked through as an ordinary, doomed person. I remember walking along the street, and my feet were walking, and I felt absolutely terrified. I didn't know why. I felt like I wanted to run away. You must have been sensitive. I just was determined to get there, because Marie had said I was in too bad a condition to go. So I was determined.

So I haven't been here since then. And then we went in that flat. How long ago is that? Thirty-six years.

Marie said to take our shoes off. I can remember wondering about that, but okay. There were all these pairs of shoes in the hall, and it was really dark. We went into that living room, and Mother was sat at the end by the window. She was working on an Indian gentleman, telling him off, not just working on him. That was the complete opposite to what I expected.

And the first thing Mother said was, "I could do a big show, but I'm your mother." The first thing she said to me was, "This one's sick." And then she came round to us all, and she said to me, "What do you feel?" I was just about to say, "I've no idea," and then I said, "Oh, oh, I feel it in my hands." She said, "You feel the vibrations here." Amazing. She said, "May God bless you, you've got it." I've got it. I had no idea what I'd got, but I've got it.

Well, I just went up, and she just said, "This one's sick." Got me to stick one hand out the window. One of those windows. But I had a strong experience just walking in the room. I just felt that she was a goddess. I thought, what's this person doing here? This is not the normal world. It's amazing. And she had a watch on with no numbers on it. Really? I can remember looking at it, and it seemed perfectly right that she had a watch with no numbers. It just seemed so appropriate that there was no time. I was wondering what the time was. It was outside of time.

It was in this place, Mother told us to put our hands over our ears, and we could actually still hear her talking, because what had happened was that we were hearing her through our sahasrara. This was to prove to us that the sahasrara had opened. We had meetings here maybe two or three times, and then from here, we went to North Gower Street.

It's strange. If we hadn't come here that day... I know. Imagine. More than lost. Definitely. It really feels strange to just see myself walking through that door.
