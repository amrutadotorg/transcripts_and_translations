 (England)
So, here we are at Ashley Gardens, number 56. Mother's flat was on the very top, wasn't it? We went up in the lift. Do you remember, Dougie, all the work that was done here?

Oh, yeah, I can remember several times. I remember one time in particular, I came here when Mother was away, and I came with a bunch of flowers. I said to C.P., "Mother's coming back today, so will you take these to make sure there are flowers in the house?"

And another rather funny thing that happened with me, which I thought was strange at the time, was that I bought some orchids, some slipper orchids, and I gave them to Mother because I thought they were really, really nice. I gave them to her, and she said to C.P., "Oh, yes, go and put them in the toilet." I felt a little bit disappointed at that. But then two weeks later, when I came there... so obviously Mother knew something that I didn't. It's the right place for them to be. The right place for everything to be, yeah. Quite incredible.

Did you do any work on it, Pat? No, I didn't. One of the things I remember most, or two things, is I got two really nice, sort of ornamental bits of brasswork from Shri Mataji here. She found out it was my birthday, and she just plucked something off the mantelpiece and gave it to me. And another time, I was feeling a bit sorry for myself, I think, and she just picked something else up and gave it to me. And I've got both of them.

Was it here that she did the hoops? The bangles? Oh, hang them on your ears? I can't remember. I'm not sure. We used to come here after meetings, because they were at Caxton Hall. Mother would invite us back from Caxton Hall and give us some food, didn't she? Yeah, she often did. Even the new people. People would come over from Caxton Hall, and we'd all go up there for a while. Yes, many, many times.

And then you had your wedding. Well, even before that, we would stay here. At one point, when we were still at Finchley Road Ashram, to clear me out, Mother said I had to leave the ashram, and I was feeling particularly sorry for myself. I said to Mother, "So I have to go then?" And she said, "Yes, you have to go." She nipped over beside me and said, "We have to keep saying it like this, so that the negativity feels that you're gone." And then she nipped back in front of me and said, "So you'll be going then?" And I just said, "Yes, of course." Because I felt completely that I understood that Mother was with me. It wasn't that I was being sent away; it was that the negativity had to believe I was out so that it would leave me alone.

And then when we went, we had our Sahaja wedding. It was at Caxton Hall. Dollis Hill, wasn't it? Yes, it was a wedding party in Dollis Hill. We all got invited. No idea whose wedding it was. We were all at Dollis Hill, and it went on till midnight. That was one of the times at Dollis Hill, in NW10, just around the corner from the tube.

And like Pat said, every Monday, for as long as I can remember, Mother would be in Caxton Hall, which is just a walk, really. And sometimes she would go into a McDonald's and have a Fillet-O-Fish and a Diet Coke, or sometimes she'd send someone out for it, and they would come back festooned with McDonald's. We were sort of amazed that the Adi Shakti would eat McDonald's and drink Diet Coke from a straw.

One of my enduring memories is Mother saying she used to watch out of the window to the Cathedral School there and watch the delivery lorries delivering casks and casks of beer and cases of whiskey for all the priests. For the Cathedral. She was absolutely amazed that this was supposedly God's house, and it was just like a pub, really.

It was lovely, really comfortable. I remember as we used to walk in there, into the hall, the big wooden Ganesha was there. And that one came to Dollis Hill; we took it to Dollis Hill, and I remember scrubbing him down, putting him in the bath, and scrubbing all the kumkum off him to make him clean.

And we did spend our wedding night here. But before that, you have to remember after that wedding in Dollis Hill, Mother gave us a lift because all the buses had stopped. That's right. When we got out of the car here. That was our first-year college exams, yes, the next day. We had the exams the next day, and Mother said, "Would you like to come in?" And Maureen said, "Oh, we have exams tomorrow." She said, "Oh, you'd better go then." So we went. She said, "So you came to the wedding even so?" "Yes, that's right." And she said, "Don't worry, you'll be all right. Don't worry, you'll be fine." And we were, eventually.

A little while after that, we were married and spent our wedding night here because there were two weddings going on, and for the other one, the family just whisked them all away. Mother said, "So you two, what are you doing?" And we just didn't know. We just looked at her and said, "We don't know." "Come with me."

So we drove through London from Hampstead to here, and we actually saw the dean of our faculty in the street. We were all dressed as Indians. I had a massive turban on, which was Mother's sari, and one of Mother's brooches there. And we were still tied together with the scarf, sitting in the back. Mother was in the front. We just saw this guy, and it was so surreal, the fact that this intellectual fool just didn't know what was driving past him.

So we got to the room. She said, "There, you go there." And we just sat there on the bed, still tied together by the flowers. We sat on the bed for must have been two or three hours. Eventually, we crept out and could hear some sort of noise. Mother was in the lounge watching the telly. It was a Bette Davis film. And Mother said, "You must watch this. She's really good." And after that, she said, "She's a very good actress, very good part." And she said, "Oh, no need for this." So she untied us, because we were still tied together with the scarf.

The next morning, we had breakfast with C.P. She told him we'd been married. And he was very pleased. He said, "Oh, thank you for staying. It's very auspicious to have you here." And then on that day, we went to pick the keys up for the ashram in Stockwell. Chelsea Road. Yes, because Mother said it was auspicious for a newly married couple. So we went there, and we were the first people in there when it was ours. It was Linda's, actually, but it was a proper ashram.

There's a lift, a central lift there that goes all the way up. One day, I came to see Shri Mataji. The lift came down, the doors opened, and I realized I was looking at Mother below my eyesight. It was the first time—I had known her for several years—because she always seemed so immense. It was the only time in my life I ever realized that. It's extraordinary.

But you'd go up in the lift and then turn, and the flat was that way, wasn't it? So you came out on that side, and then you'd go into the entrance. You spent ages painting that frame over the radiator, didn't you? She put grills over all the radiators to hide them, with a nice shelf and ornaments on everything. Douglas, I can remember you painting.

I did. I actually did spend quite a lot of time in there doing bits and pieces. I remember as you go in the hall, you go through the door, and on the right, there's a large double cupboard with two mirrors on it. The outside of the mirrors was decorated with hand-carved woodwork from India. She gave me all these pieces of woodwork to put on. I sort of fiddled around with them for a little bit, and then I realized that there was just enough to go around these cupboards. It was quite amazing. So I decorated the outside of these cupboards, and then what I did was I went out and bought some glass mirrors. We put two huge glass mirrors on it. Really amazing, because it was a coat cupboard. They could hang out and see what they looked like. So I put that in myself. But Mother's, of course, supplied the parts.

Next to the cupboard, there was always a Ganesha. I remember C.P. used to sort of touch his feet when he'd go out. It was a big, dark, wooden carved one. The one that was at Dollis Hill. I remember washing him in the bath in Dollis Hill, upstairs. Big, beautiful. It wasn't quite ebony, but very dark wood.

And Mother, actually in here, gave me a Ganesha, which I've still got—a tiny little jade Ganesha. She said, "There, it's broken. You might fix him." And where his hand is like that, the hand was broken off. So I got some superglue, and I've never had superglue work before. And it worked. It's still there, 30 years later. And he's still on the altar.

But inside, the house was very lush, wasn't it? It was comfortable. Beautiful carpets, embroidered carpets laid everywhere all over the floor. She'd always get nice chandeliers. Yes, always. Lots of ornaments. There was always light. The furniture was quite ornate.

There was the long room that was the dining room and the long room that was the living room as well, both on the front. They were quite huge. Mother's bedroom was the first bedroom down the end of the passageway. And do you remember in the passageway, Mother made false ceilings to put all the luggage and stuff she needed to put away? Yeah, she did that quite often. She said it was a waste of space in some areas, so she'd make a false ceiling and create a space to store stuff.

And do you remember the kitchen? Mother went in the kitchen and she made sandwiches for all of us to take with us when we were going down to that place to see those people who were supposedly all spiritualists. We'd been invited by that guy who came to the meetings, and we were all terrified. Mother said, "Right, you've got to be really prepared for this." And these spiritualists, they're working with spirits and all this. We went down there and they all turned out to be realized. They were all amazing. We had a wonderful time.

I don't even remember how many bedrooms there were. There must have been three, I think. Oh, more than that. I can't remember.

Well, I wasn't involved in Ashley Gardens quite so much as everyone else because I was in trouble. Do you remember the beginning? Yes, that was your time out. I got sent out. Well, not sent out. Mother must have said, "You're caught up and you're affecting the others. I think you ought to really go out and be separate for a while. But I don't really want you to go out there on your own. You might get lost." I said, "No, no, I won't." She said, "Don't worry." I said, "I promise I won't get lost."

I'd just come, not long come, out of the drug scene and been a squatter in London, living on Mars bars and amphetamines, among other things. And that was just the bit I could tell. Basically, I had given up. No, I hadn't given up. Not exactly given up. Well, you might have. I can remember you saying to me, maybe next life you'd feel some joy. Whereas I was all going, "It's fantastic!" and you were going, "Oh, God." Because it was exhausting. Looking back, I can't imagine how I kept going. But I felt I had no choice. You've got to keep going, because I refused to believe that I wouldn't find what I was looking for. But looking at it from a practical point of view, it was hopeless. I was in a real mess. I was hardly in the real world anymore. But that was partly why I saw all these things in Shri Mataji when I came. I got a bedsit round the corner from the ashram. But this was at Finchley.

I wasn't supposed to go to the ashram. I was supposed to stay away. I used to go and visit him and they'd all say, "What are you doing? You're attached." And I'd say, "It's my brother. What are you talking about?" It was only a few months and then I moved back into Dollis Hill at the beginning, basically. Yeah, that's right. I was doing an art college course, an interior design course, so I was quite busy and focused on that. But yeah, I remember I got flu and I was really ill. And towards the end, I was just getting better when I got it all over again. So, I had flu twice in two weeks in succession. And that was when Shri Mataji said, "Really..."

Well, I was just remembering how we would come here sometimes and especially the girls were very privileged in that they would get to sleep in Shri Mataji's bedroom. I can remember one incident like that where another yogini and myself were there and Shri Mataji said, "Lie down on the bed, lie down, let's sleep now, sleep now." And this other yogini was laid on one side and Shri Mataji apologized to me because she said she always sleeps on her right side. So, she had her back to me. I said, "Really? That's fine." And I lay down and then after a while she said, "Maureen, are you there?" I said, "Yes." She said, "I can't... where are you?" Because I didn't dare cuddle up to her. I was just, "I'm here, Mother." She said, "Where are you?" I sort of inched a bit nearer and just lay there and relaxed. But I just couldn't let go to the fact that it was okay to just be in such a space.

And then later in India we heard how if anybody laid on Shri Mataji's bed who was unauthorized, they'd be thrown off the bed by the deities. So, I must have been a bit aware of that, that what I was doing was a little bit... There are a few fierce deities about. Yes, it was as if I was growing up a tiny bit and stopped feeling like the little baby that could do whatever.

When Shri Mataji said we should do a big public program, we looked everywhere. I can't remember who found Caxton Hall as the right place, but we told Mother and she said to go ahead. The great thing about Caxton Hall is it had many different rooms in it. The only one I can definitely remember is the Great Hall. About once a month we'd get the Great Hall and do a big public program. We actually advertised the very first one in Time Out. It was quite a fair-sized hall, the one on the right. We made such a mess of it that Bogdan said the only reason he came was he thought that anyone who made such a mess of an advert must be regular people and not publicity types.

Do you remember buying all those plates in Oxford Street? Mother bought a load of, I think it was Crown Derby china, in Oxford Street. I think it was a sale at Selfridges. Mother used to shop a lot in the Army & Navy as well, didn't she? I can remember going shopping in Oxford Street with Mother and I had something wrong with my eyes. My Vishuddhi was working out. She said I just had to follow her with one hand out and one hand down, and I had to keep shutting my eyes because they had all gone big. So we'd just be wandering around with her buying things.

Mother used to shop a lot in the Army & Navy for things like crockery and bed linen and things like that. It's a nice House of Fraser store. She was always quite keen on the quality stuff. She wouldn't get any rubbish in.

They started in October 1977, and they must have gone on for several years. When Mother went to India, she'd go for about three months, January to March. They'd stop then. We never did meetings without Mother. We weren't really at that point. We just survived for three months, except for the time, obviously, when we went with her.

Mother came every single Monday. It was just a fixed event. As I say, once a month we'd have the Great Hall and have a big meeting and do another big publicity drive. It would always be packed. Absolutely packed. Mother would see everybody in the hall. She'd give a talk. And there was one day when Gregoire decided that he would announce who Shri Mataji was. He gave the big talk and, in his own way, paused and very slowly pronounced her to be the Adi Shakti. Mother said that it went over some people's heads one way and other people's another way. They just... it was all too much for them. But we were expecting them all to go, "This is it! We've found her!" And they were just sitting there as usual.

Even at one of the Caxton Hall meetings, some lady stood up and said that she was the Adi Shakti. Shri Mataji had been going round seeing everybody in all the chairs, so it so happened she was stood in front of Mother when she said it. Shri Mataji just looked at her and said, "Really? I think you should go and do your own meetings." And she left. It's just extraordinary that people were so blind. They would come, they'd get their realization, they'd go. And then a new lot would come and get realization and go. And then a few would hang on.

This is Caxton Hall. This is sort of a fairly typical Victorian-built municipal building, which is in private hands now. This is where Mother used to have public meetings every Monday for years and years and years. This is where I met Mother, just after Easter of 1979. She came in, and it wasn't the Great Hall; it was one of the smaller halls. I was sitting at the front. Mother gave a talk, and she used to come and work on people individually. Now they think, "No, that's not right. Mother wouldn't do that." But Mother came down and talked to everyone who was new, asking, "Did you feel it?" and things like that. So everyone put their hand up and said they felt it. I had met Maureen a while before, and she took me to meet Mother. Maureen was nervously standing behind me, saying, "This is him, Mother, this is him." And Mother said, "He's all right." And that was it. That was fine. That was as much approbation as I would ever need.

Caxton Hall is a magnificent building. It was quite well known in the 60s especially, because it was the registry office, so lots of celebrities—pop stars and film stars, British pop stars and film stars—were married then. You would always see them on the newsreels, coming out of Caxton Hall.

This was my first real experience of public meetings here. This was where we did the first ever public meeting. Just to add to the mix, there were a number of meeting rooms for hire in Caxton Hall, and over the years, we probably used all of them. As Maureen said, once a month or something like that, we used to have the Great Hall, which was the biggest one. It was Victorian municipal architecture. All the rooms were wood-paneled with lovely parquet flooring. Mother loved that sort of thing, anyway, the quality build of things.

The meetings had sort of the same format. Mother would talk, introduce Herself. She would talk about Sahaja Yoga, about whatever subject she wanted to talk about. She would raise everyone's kundalini, and then she would come in between us and walk up and down the rows, working on people and working on the chakras, raising their kundalini individually, which is, thinking back, astonishing. It's an awesome thing to be part of, to be a witness to.

The meeting room was quite amusing, really, because Mother would turn up around 7:00 or 7:30 p.m., give her talk, and then she'd go around checking everybody. I remember the old guy, the caretaker that was there, he'd start turning the lights off at about half past ten. Mother would just sort of carry on and take no notice. Eventually, he got used to the way we went, because Mother didn't stop until she was finished. He waited for her. Quite often she'd work on everyone, all the new people. She wouldn't go until the job was finished.

One time there was a demonstration by the National Front outside the hall. Mother said, "Oh, don't worry. When the fox wants to die, it comes to the town." And that started the demise of the National Front. We also had some politicians speaking one night in another hall, do you remember? And we left our bag behind, and they had to call out the bomb squad to defuse it in case it was... one of the Conservatives, I believe. Oh, I don't know. It was quite funny.

But that first public meeting was really awesome. It changed everything. In two hours, we went into the meeting with one thing and came out with another. It was just a complete electric... it was like the lights got put on. I thought it was like changing gears, a whole new era. You could feel it, couldn't you? It was just amazing.

At that time, there were these phases, wasn't there? When we met Shri Mataji at Bharata Vidya Bhavan, it was like an introduction. From Bharata Vidya Bhavan, we went to Judd Street. Now, Judd Street, it was like a sort of germination because one or two more people came in. After Judd Street, we went to North Gower Street. At North Gower Street, it started to take root. The roots started to grow. And then coming to here, to Caxton Hall, the plant was starting to grow. It was starting to flower. I think that is what it was like. It was a real change, definitely.

And then we had all these new seekers coming to see... Bogdan, Bala, and all these people. Bogdan came for the first ever one, the first night. David Baxter got his realization. He rang us up at the ashram about four days later and said, "Excuse me, how long does this bliss last?" I said, "What do you mean?" He said, "I can't do my job. I'm dissolving in bliss. What am I going to do?" He was a reporter. That was hilarious. He was always funny. He moved into the ashram with us.

Here's the main entrance where we stood many a time, waiting to see Shri Mataji off. Her car would be here. We'd all gather, and the poor caretaker would be there saying, "It's really time. I have to shut the door." And we'd still move another inch further forward. The whole pavement would be full of Sahaja Yogis, with people wondering what the whole big deal was. Then Shri Mataji would be there in her car and off she'd drive. And then we'd finally, reluctantly go off to the Spaghetti House for our supper.

The meetings ran from 1977 to 1983. That's a long time. Six years. On average, we'd get a few hundred people. The Great Hall would hold 200 or 300, anyway. The first meeting there was a lot, I'm sure. About 200 at the very least. But then after this first meeting here, our numbers went up from 60 or 70 straight away. But they did change. People would come and people would go.

Shri Mataji used to do national tours all the time when C.P. was off on business. She went to my hometown, Middlesbrough. She went to Derby, Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds. She went to Leeds a lot. During the day, when she would stay overnight, she would go shopping. One has been captured on film. Someone filmed her shopping for crockery in Derby, because Derby's near where the potteries are in the North West Midlands. And there's film of her just going around this lovely crockery shop with lots of Sahaja Yogis just following behind her, on the tail of a comet, really. She used to love that.

When she'd speak, she would speak about the area itself. My hometown's an industrial town. Before the Victorian era, there was nothing there. They discovered iron ore in the local hills, and it was effectively built on steel. Teesside and Sheffield were the two centers of the steel industry in England for a long time. So Mother came to Middlesbrough and gave a talk in the polytechnic there. She would drive around and ask about the locale where she was going to speak. I drove her around and across the Transporter Bridge, across the River Tees, which is a really lovely bridge. She asked me what the town was. I said it was built on steel. We'd just had our third child, our second son, and we didn't have a name for him. He was only a few weeks old. I said, "Mother, can you name him?" She said, "What's this town built on?" I said, "Oh, it's built on steel, Mother." She said, "Oh, we'll call him Samarth," which is the man who was equal to his own name. "And we'll call him Samson as well." So he's called Samarth Samson. We said, isn't he beautiful? He was named in a steel town. So he's like a man of steel. It's beautiful.

After the Caxton Hall meetings, most times we would all decant to the Tavola Calda. There'd be 20, 30, 40 of us in there. Actually, Mother would come and sit upstairs at the corner table. But it's shut now. It was another particularly significant or auspicious building. Great memories for us all from 1979 and the early 80s until Caxton Hall shut. And the Spaghetti House. Oh, well. We've done the walk.

This is the way I came with Shri Mataji in a taxi somewhere around here where we got behind the Grenadier Guards. The whole regiment, all in full regalia, in the middle of the road, and the taxi just behind them at a walking pace. I was in a taxi with Shri Mataji. It was hilarious. We laughed because it was like they were escorting her. And then she started working on the soldiers. She said their right side was very bad. Exhausted. Amazing.

Somewhere up here, for some reason, some yogis had this idea that Marble Arch used to be the Garden of Eden. Don't ask me why. I mentioned it to Shri Mataji as we drove round it, and she said, "Really?" You can imagine it. There were a lot of strange ideas about. Actually, I think they used to hang people there, didn't they? Tyburn.

But we had Selfridges. Mother went to Selfridges quite a lot. In fact, at one stage, she had loads of Sahaja yogis working in there. John Watkinson worked in there, Dawn worked in there. There was a whole gang of them. At an earlier stage, she had a whole load of us working in Harrods. She'd say, "Pat, you must get a job there." And Pat looked all sort of, "What?" I'd just got this amazing job as a props man in the BBC on TV, setting up sets and everything. I was really chuffed. And she said, "No, that's not a suitable job for you. It's like being a porter." Mother said to Pat, "Yes, you must get a job in Harrods," and then turned to me and said, "Yes, you should too." My face dropped. We both ended up in there. I was working in the bakery department.

This was North Gower Street, wasn't it? Yes, this is it. It was a bit farther down, on the right. 162. No, it was 160. It's at the back there. I know where it is. It's the other side of the square. But does it still exist? I don't think so. It was an old bank. That's where we met Mukund Shah, the yoga playboy. He was the one who told us about Shri Mataji. And do you know who told him to come to England? Sathya Sai Baba. Oh, well. That works in mysterious ways. It certainly does.

We all lived around here before we met Shri Mataji. There were all these streets where we hung out a lot. Ambala Sweets. When we had puja with Mother, we would come to Ambala and buy one box of Indian sweets. We now know they were called barfi and laddu. There'd be a variety, some pistachios, some... we didn't know. It was like food of the gods. To have a little piece of this vibrated Indian sweet. Sweets never tasted anything like it in our lives. It was beautiful.

It was just around the corner in North Gower Street. It was one of the second or third times I met Shri Mataji. She was on her own. It was Gregoire with her, and that was about all, with a whole room full of hippies all arguing about drugs. At one point, she just sort of hugged herself and went, "What can I do?" I just thought she's just like a mother with all these naughty children. So I just said, "Okay, I'll stop," see what happens. I stopped taking drugs and got a lot of dirty looks from all the others. But it was amazing how courageous she was. Coming from her background, the level of society she lived on, into a room... they were a very wild bunch around here. They really were. She just took on the whole room of them. It was quite amazing.

It germinated in Judd Street, it started to take root. Then when it got to here, North Gower Street, it had a permanent place and it started to grow. And when it got to Caxton Hall, it started to spread. So it was like a flower. We had a fair few weeds around here as well, didn't we? Well, Mother said in one of her talks that all the rubbish went into the foundations. But what you've got to remember is even if the rubbish goes into the foundations, it makes the foundations stronger so it can support the whole building. So even those that got passed aside would have done their bit in a way.

Why do you think people in those early days, some of them just didn't stick on? The penny didn't drop as to who Shri Mataji was? As you said, the penny didn't drop. They might have known, but they weren't prepared to believe. Or they were so into other things that to them it just seemed like another experience. There was peer pressure as well. I got quite a lot of stick about stopping taking drugs and one thing or another. People were very cynical. You go to a couple of parties, get a bit wasted, and you lose all the vibrations and you see it all differently. It happened to me. I came back after the first week, but I didn't make it the second week. I meant to, but I didn't. Shri Mataji asked after me because Maureen went. She came back and said, "Oh, Shri Mataji asked where you were." I was quite touched. I thought, sweet of her to remember.

They were rough. I remember that speed freak who threw the brick through the window. He was on the third floor, wasn't it? The brick came right through the window. We were all sitting there with Shri Mataji, and this brick came flying through the window. Shri Mataji said, "Look, did you see the way it moved?" So it didn't hurt anyone. It actually came straight through the window and then went like that. Well, that's what she said. Anyway, I knew who it was because he was shouting outside. So I leapt up in a fury and went pounding down the stairs to catch him and wring his neck. Afterwards, they told me Shri Mataji was putting bandhans on me so that I wouldn't find him, so he wouldn't get hurt.

I vaguely remember at that time, Shri Mataji saying something like, "Don't worry, when I go, I shall pull in my net." Some of them were good people, some of them were nice. They got lost again. But who knows? There were a lot of them around here. Also, you had to give up a lot of fun. It was like one big permanent party around here. It just never stopped.

Did Shri Mataji say anything about coming from this decadence of the Western 60s and 70s? Oh, yeah. Every time she met someone, she'd talk to them and find out what they'd been doing and what their background was, probing them, trying to find out what condition they were in. And she'd always be horrified. She'd just say she couldn't believe so many people had become so damaged so young, or had been through so much suffering so young. She meant suffering in a spiritual sense, just lost and frustrated and that kind of thing. They were a heavy, heavy bunch. Remember that guy we used to call the Incredible Hulk? He used to sit in the back of the room going, "Ha, ha, ha, what universe are we in today? Ha, ha, ha."

Downstairs, there was a barber. You go in there and go up three flights of stairs. The first floor was their offices, Gavin's office. And then the second two floors were a maisonette. The first floor was the office, the second floor was their living room and the kitchen, and the top floor was the bedrooms and a bathroom. They rented it. And that's where that Guru Puja was where Shri Mataji sat on a brown sofa with flowers sort of apparently growing out from her feet. And that brown sofa would pull out and be a double bed, and she'd lie down and sleep. Sometimes, we'd all lie on the floor and take vibrations.

The first follow-up to the first Caxton Hall program was up here, wasn't it? Yes, that's right. So that's 1977. It went on for quite a few years. When they had children, they were still here. Olympia was born in 1980. But the meeting stopped, I think, once we got Finchley. We more or less moved over to there.

That guy who threw the brick, it was actually the second floor, wasn't it? Yes, it would have been this window, the third one up. Because that's where the lounge would have been, and that's where she would have been sitting. We had a lot of meetings here, including the follow-ups. Bogdan came here. This is where Jamal got his realization after the Mind, Body and Spirit festival. That's right. This is where he got that crashing headache off Gus and said that he now believed in collective consciousness.

I came here one day, early for the meeting on a Sunday, and I found Shri Mataji waiting outside in the street on her own. Nobody was here yet. She'd come up by herself on the train from Oxted and was just standing here, waiting.

I know that after that first puja, the Guru Puja, when we came out into the street here, it was the first time I felt like mankind had put a very thin layer of concrete over the earth, and that the earth was this huge, pulsating thing. We were like ants, the little effect we'd had on it. It was the most amazing thing. It's like Mother had shifted the whole feeling. London, this amazing town, was just a transitory thing, just a thin thing on the surface. So wafer-thin compared to her strength beneath.

This block across the road here, with all the windows, I've always thought, that's where the squatting community used to be that we were part of. And I've always thought of those windows as like a reflection, as we think of Shiva, as if it's a monument to establishing the spirit in the middle of London.

This was where I had my second meeting with Shri Mataji, and from then on. The first one was Judd Street. Yeah, that was where I made my famous faux pas with the Guruji, I think. Shri Mataji said to record it, and I said, "Well, why, Shri Mataji? We're all here."

Mother once called us there one afternoon-stroke-evening, and we were all there, falling asleep. She gave a talk on the Vishuddhi, which was recorded. It was coming on for 10 or 11 at night, and she carried on talking, carried on working on us. About an hour later, she said, "You see?" And I realized that we'd all woken up and we were all alert. She had just worked it out through us. It was just incredible to go from praying to be allowed to lie down, to being absolutely right on board. Amazing.

She often stayed over, and we would all sit in a row by the bed, taking vibrations. Part of me would be feeling how amazing this was, to take the vibrations, and part of me would be dying for Mother to say, "That's it, you're all right, you can lie down now." I'd be fighting with this pathetic bit that wanted to lie down. "No, you can lie down any other time. This is it, this is it." And then when Mother would say, "That's it," I'd say, "Oh, no, no, I didn't want it to stop, really."

This was where I got that poisoning, that paraquat weedkiller poisoning. My legs swelled up. Shri Mataji came several times to work on my legs and massage the swelling down. They swelled right up, didn't they? They were unbelievable, like huge great cushions, and you could just press them and they stayed pressed. It's because I'd been inhaling paraquat weedkiller, which is lethal. Not on purpose, it was accidental. And I was very ill for weeks. Shri Mataji came and saw me several times and spent a lot of time trying to work it out. I got better in the end.

Judging from your book and things like that, you seem to have had some pretty miraculous escapes. I had a few lives left over. I was very lucky. I was very lucky I made it out of the 70s. If I hadn't met Shri Mataji, no way would that have happened. I don't think a few of us might well have succumbed if we hadn't met Mother. We definitely would have.

Caxton Hall was the public program. But from '75 to '77, we were just here and in different places with Shri Mataji. It was just intensive work with Shri Mataji and a small group of us for two years. For two years, it was only about six or seven of us. There were floating people. We'd bring people, and they'd just drift off. But there was this core of six or seven of us. It was very hard work, actually. Great fun, but hard work. And it was just very intensive.

We had a couple of meetings at Judd Street. The Mukund Shah yoga teacher took us there. What happened was that we didn't want to have any more meetings in the Bharata Vidya Bhavan, so Mukund Shah told us to come to his house, and he lived up there somewhere.

We had meetings here for about three or four times, and they were on a Sunday. At this particular time, Mother told us to put our hands over our ears, and we could actually still hear her talking because we were hearing her through our Sahasrara. This was to prove to us that the Sahasrara had opened. As I say, we had meetings here maybe two or three times, and then from here, we went to North Gower Street.

This is where I came to my first meeting with Shri Mataji. I only came here once. We came together with a lot of people. No, the first time we came, it was just you and me and Marie. Yeah, it was raining, remember? There was a thunderstorm the night before.

It's amazing. That's the last door I walked through as an ordinary, doomed person. I remember walking along the street, and my feet were walking, but I felt absolutely terrified. I didn't know why. I felt like I wanted to run away. I don't know what I felt. I just was determined to get there because Marie had said I was in too bad a condition to go. So I was determined to get there.

I haven't been here since that day, 36 years ago. Marie said to take our shoes off. I can remember wondering about that, but okay. There were all these pairs of shoes in the hall, and it was really dark. We went into that living room, and Mother was sat at the end by the window, which would be one of these. She was working on an Indian gentleman. A Sikh. That was the complete opposite of what I expected. The first thing Mother said was that, "I could do a big show, but I'm your Mother." The first thing she said to me was, "This one's sick."

She came round to us all, and she said to me, "What do you feel?" I was just about to say, "I've no idea," and I said, "Oh, oh, I feel it in my hands." She said, "You feel the vibrations here." And she said, "May God bless you, you've got it." I'd got it, but I had no idea what I'd got.

Well, I just went up, and she just said, "This one's sick." Got me to stick one hand out the window. One of those windows. I had quite a strong experience just walking in the room. I just felt that she was a goddess. I never thought that before. I just thought, "What's this person doing here? This is not the normal world."

She had a watch on with no numbers on it. I can remember looking at it, and it seemed perfectly right that she had a watch with no numbers on at all. It just had like a tick here and there. It just seemed so appropriate that there was no time, because I was wondering what the time was. It was outside time.

It's just so awesome to be here after all that time, 36 years. Strange. If we hadn't come here that day... I know. Imagine. Lost. More than lost.

I brought this young lad round, a guy called Rafe. He was the son of an artist that was living near me. I brought him here, but he spent all the time laying on his tummy, crawling around underneath all the furniture. He was about 10 or 11. He was sort of slithering on his tummy, going underneath all the furniture. Mother said he was possessed by a snake. Really? Yeah. Well. That's it. Right. Okay. I'm leaving. Strange. Incredible.
