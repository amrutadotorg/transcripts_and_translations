Hello everyone. What a wonderful idea to have a topic like talking about the saris and also the relationship with the saris and Shri Mataji. I'm sure there are many, many stories about it, and they are all diverse and beautiful.

So, my story starts in 1980 when I was still in Switzerland, and we had started to organize Sahaja Yoga programs. Actually, that was the second time we organized a program in Geneva. I was the one who actually set them up. I had invited a lot of people: some colleagues, some teachers at the university where I was teaching, and quite a lot of my friends came. It was just a lovely program.

Shri Mataji was very humorous. For instance, there was one friend of mine who was a banker, and he couldn't feel the vibrations. So, Shri Mataji asked him to say, "Mother, are you the banker of all the bankers?" And then, lo and behold, he felt the vibrations. Everybody laughed, of course, because it was really funny and very nice, very lighthearted.

After this program, Shri Mataji told a little group to go to the place of one young yogi called Mathias and to gather there. So, a little group went. It was a small apartment in the old town of Geneva, and we all gathered up there. I think we were about six or seven, not more. One of my friends attended, and she couldn't really feel the vibrations. She was really wondering who Shri Mataji was.

At first, Shri Mataji told us that she was very happy with the program. And then she gave me a beautiful sari, which I’ll show you here. It was one of hers, actually, one of her saris. The lila is incredible because this is my favorite color. It's Indian pink and it's completely interwoven. I don't know if you can see this. It's not only plain; you can see a complete thread. The weave is beautiful. It was just a bit casually on my lap, but it was fine.

Then this friend asked Shri Mataji if she was a prophet, and Shri Mataji just smiled. She still couldn't feel the vibrations. So, I had the idea to tell her, "Why don't you put your hands towards this sari that Shri Mataji just gave me?" And lo and behold, she felt tremendous vibrations coming from the sari. Maybe she had a little block on the agnya because she was coming from a Protestant family, and in the Protestant church, the Virgin Mary and female deities were not really so much worshipped. However, she felt such strong vibrations that Shri Mataji asked my brother Gregoire to read the stanzas of the Devi Mahatmya. Then, this friend went into a very deep meditation. She was really, and she is, a very ancient soul who was worshipping the Mother Goddess, kind of like Devi Durga. So that's one part of the story.

Fast forward to 1988, I was sent to Colombia. I was living at the ashram with all my family and my children. I had three babies, and we were looking after the ashram with another yogini. I was very busy, of course, as you can imagine, with three little ones. Shri Mataji wanted to give me a little vacation. She was also going to Colombia, where one of my friends, Brigitte, was preparing programs for Shri Mataji in Bogota. So we all stayed in her apartment in Bogota. It was wonderful because we were cooking for Shri Mataji, and we were a little committee preparing these programs. Lots of people actually came; a thousand people came to these first programs in Bogota.

But what I remember was the puja, which was in Brigitte's garden. Shri Mataji was there, obviously. I don't remember which puja it was, but we were a group of about 40 or 50 people. At the end of the puja, all the ladies wanted to ask Shri Mataji for a name. And I thought, "Oh my God, that would be really nice. I'm also going to queue and I want to have a name from Shri Mataji." I was wearing this sari that she had given me.

When I arrived where she was sitting still on her chair after the puja, she asked me, "Oh, Antoinette, you also want a name?" I said, "Oh, yes, Shri Mataji, I would love a name, if you could give me one." She was just reflecting for a little moment or in meditation, and she said, "Amruta," which I love. So she gave me the name of Amruta.

And then she said, "What a beautiful sari you are wearing. Where did you get this sari? One doesn't find these saris anymore. They are a very old kind of fashion." I said to Shri Mataji, "Shri Mataji, you gave it to me 10 years ago." And so she laughed and I laughed. There's a photo of it that I think, Caroline, you can show. She was touching the fabric. This is Shri Mataji taking the fabric into her hands and looking at it and saying, "Oh, we don't find these saris anymore." And this is Brigitte, by the way, kneeling there.

That's my story.

The other story is that Shri Mataji used to choose all our cotton saris when we arrived in India. And it was always unusual colors. But then when we were wearing them, the unusual color that maybe we wouldn't have worn because we didn't like it or something, would be amazing. It was a color that would suit you perfectly. I remember a dark purple cotton sari. I never wear purple, but I put it on and it was beautiful. Another one was a really deep green, and I don't wear deep green, but again, it was a lovely color on me. For me, they are just such a beautiful memory of those India tours, which were in the early 80s.

This is a photo of Shri Mataji. She had a house... there were two houses in Hounslow, but this is the one which Vicky and Ian Lewis had bought. She was packing away her saris into a trunk. I was in the house moving things around, and then she saw me.

Not many people know that when you're in Shri Mataji's presence, she reads your mind. I was wondering what was happening because it didn't seem like just normal packing away. And then she said to me that the reason why she was going to pack away her saris and lock them up in the case was because if any of her relatives or anybody tried to use them or touch them, it wouldn't be good. So she was doing that to protect them.

So if you look closely, Shri Mataji is smiling after the photo has been taken. She can read your mind and is just all-knowing. That's my story.

Hello, everyone. Can you hear me well?

I have three short stories. Well, there are many, but I've chosen just the first three.

In 1979 or 1980, she offered me a sari. It was my first sari. Then, for my third puja, which was in Zurich in October 1980, I was trying to get ready because the puja was at our place—Arno's and mine. When you are hosting everyone at your place for the puja and doing the cooking, you can imagine I was a little bit rushed to get everything done properly and to get myself ready. It was the second time I was wearing a sari, and I had no clue really how to put it on. Suddenly, she was in our room, and she called me and said, "Maria Emilia, come, come here." And then in two seconds, she just did it. She made the pleats and it was done. It was so fast and so perfectly well done that I had no time to see how she did it. But I still have the sari, obviously, and ever since I've been wearing it in several pujas after I learned how to put them on. It's blue with a red border. Beautiful. So that was the first sari that I had, and she was the one putting it on me, showing me how to do it.

The second story is that before going to India for the first big tour, which was 1980-81, she offered me a sari. She said, "Well, it's just in silk, but you see, it's quite a nice one because I did all the drawing and had it printed." So the sari is this. She did the drawing. It's just flowers all over. I don't know if you can see it well, but she was the one who designed it and had it printed on silk. That was a very, very special thing also. I did not know that she would do such a thing.

The third story is again about a sari that she offered. It was so sweet because at the beginning, in the late 70s and early 80s, we were fewer people, but she was always offering us and giving us presents and saris to the ladies. She offered me a sari for a wedding—not my wedding, for another wedding.

I had it, and then I went to London in 1981 to attend the first collective weddings that she held. Not the first, but the first official ones, because there were some other weddings before. In '81, she had 15 couples getting married. And at the last minute, she had a 16th couple getting remarried, because we had been married before, not by her. So she told us to be the 16th couple to be married at that moment.

Of course, I did not know this was going to happen. All the other ladies had their saris and chunis and everything. I had taken this sari because it was a very beautiful one, but that was it. I had no chuni, nothing. And there was also Hillary, who was also getting remarried. There were 14 couples plus two getting remarried, which made 16. So, at the last minute, Shri Mataji magically asked someone to go to her house and bring two chunis. She didn't say colors; she didn't say anything.

When the person came back with the two chunis, one was white, and the other bride’s wedding sari was blue and embroidered in silver, so it was perfect for her. The other one was pink. And here is the sari I had. The two chunis that came were perfect for the saris that we had. So we could have the entire attire for the wedding.

That's all. Thank you.

Hello, everyone. This is my first time coming to the early yogis group, and I'm very happy to be here. This is one of my favorite subjects: saris and Shri Mataji. I'm very excited to share with you. I have a lot of stories, and I've pared them down, but here I'll begin.

I want to begin with my very first India tour. I got my realization in London in '82. I was visiting my sister; Marcia and Danny were there. It wasn't until '84 that I actually, in earnest, started practicing Sahaja Yoga, around June. That December, I went to India. I arrived there still kind of wondering what this was all about. The tour started in Bombay, and then it went to Vaitarna, where we received our tour saris. I actually have kept these for the last 40 years. This will look familiar to everybody. See, remember these? I think almost everybody got one of these. And just like Antoinette was saying, I never wore orange—bright orange. I never would have worn this color or combination. But we were given, I think, seven or eight saris, and that's what we were going to wear. Never, ever would I wear yellow, but here's one of those saris from one of those early tours. It's really beautiful to remember these styles.

So, we went to Vaitarna, and it was really late. We'd come late on the bus, and everybody was getting their luggage and finding a place to stay. My luggage was nowhere to be found. I waited and waited and waited. Finally, it was found, but the only place left to stay was in the same bungalow as Shri Mataji. There were about 20 of us. That night, it was very late, and I remember so clearly rolling up my sleeping bag and sitting. I was literally 20 feet from Shri Mataji's door, where she was sleeping. And I just felt this pressure, like I could clearly feel a hand—and I knew it was Her hand—on my heart, pushing, pushing, pushing. I just felt like, "Oh, she's helping me. She's helping me. Thank you. Thank you."

In the morning, when we got up, Shri Mataji came out of the room. This was the first real day of the tour, and She said, "I'm going to show you how to do it." So she took a sari, and with all us ladies there, of course, she started to wrap it around. She said, "First you tie it, wrap it around once. Then you bring it around." That's when she said, "It's wrapped in three and a half coils," telling us how auspicious it is and how it's a very dignified and spiritual thing to wear, to encourage us. She brought it around and showed, very slowly, how to make the folds and tuck them in. Then, after she had it over her shoulder, she showed how you can also bring it around and tuck it in. I remember her going like this, saying, "This way, your arms are free and you can do any work." It was such a moment. She said, "Some people say that when you're wearing a sari, you have to be so dainty and can't do any work, but no, you can do anything in a sari. Even you can be a warrior in a sari." I remember her saying that. It was such an amazing moment, and I felt so lucky to have experienced that.

I have one that is very familiar to many of you. Do you remember this pink one? Everybody on the tour got this. It was bright pink, hot pink, which, again for me was like, "Really?" But all 200 or 300 of us got the same sari. There was a time when you would go to a puja and half the ladies would be wearing this sari.

I loved going on the India tour and I went every year, starting in 1984-85. During those years, as I was getting established in Sahaja Yoga and really trying to get cleared out, there was one year I went and I was not in very good shape. I had a terrible case of left-sidedness and was very, very depressed. It was in Vaitarna, actually, and I was walking along. It would happen on these tours that all of a sudden, Shri Mataji would appear. In this case, she sat down about 200 or 300 yards away from where I was. Yogis were helping her, and she put out a whole lot of saris in front of her on a cloth. I went over there, but there was this big metal fencing, like a gate, and she was on the other side.

I'm looking through this gate, looking at these saris, and I'm thinking to myself, "Why should I even buy a sari? After all, how many pujas am I going to go to? I'm just not going to make it in Sahaja Yoga." At that moment, she looked at me, and she called out, "Linda, come buy this sari." And this is the sari that she wanted me to buy. It's an amazing organza sari. This sari, I felt, was the sari that saved me and kept me going in Sahaja Yoga. I wore it so many times that it actually ripped—organza is pretty light—but I recently got somebody to sew it for me. This is one of my most precious saris. I mean, I bought it, but it really felt that absolutely, she gave it to me at that moment of need.

The next one... I guess it was in 1990. I was on the tour, and we were in the city with the Mahalakshmi temple, where there's all the shopping and the bangles. It would happen that we would all get released into the town to do some shopping. This one day, we heard someone in the town say, "Shri Mataji is here!" I happened to hear she was in a sari shop. I was with three other ladies, and we went to that sari shop. We were standing outside the shop, but to the side of the door because we didn't want to disturb her. That year, I was getting married. Just as we're standing there, someone came out and said, "Shri Mataji has sent this sari for your wedding." She was at the back of the store; she never came forward. But this is the sari, my wedding sari. It's very heavy, with a lot of silver work. It's red, which is the traditional color. I felt so blessed.

The next one is an embarrassing moment. So many of these situations can be embarrassing. This was in Cabella in the early '90s, and I had gone for Krishna Puja. I always would go a week in advance to prepare, and Shri Mataji would talk about preparing for the puja, give the menus, and all these things. So, I was there in the drawing room with not very many other people. As we were sitting there, some yogis arrived with a suitcase. They said that they had found the suitcase and it was full of saris that some former yogini had stolen. They had recovered this suitcase full of saris. Shri Mataji was happy, and they took the saris into her bedroom.

At that point, I had not yet received a sari from Shri Mataji. I had heard stories about people who had, and I thought, "Oh, that would be so nice." This is the first time I really understood that she hears every single thought you have when you're in her presence. So, there I am thinking, "Oh, wouldn't it be nice to get a sari from Shri Mataji?" Right after I have this thought, she calls one of the yogis. The yogi disappears into her bedroom and comes out with this sari. This sari must have been from that suitcase, I think. And the turquoise is my very favorite color. I was so embarrassed, but also so delighted. For so many years, even now, when somebody says, "If there's a fire and you have to leave your house in a hurry, what would you bring?" this sari is one of the things that I have ready to bring.

The next one is another story, also in Cabella. I came early to prepare for Krishna Puja. There were, I think, three Indian ladies plus me who were there. Just before the puja, Shri Mataji gave saris to each of us. They got these very heavy, embroidered, puja-type saris, and I got this one, which is again my favorite color, turquoise. It's this very lightweight material, simple but so bright. I loved the sari, but then when we got back to the room, the other ladies looked at my sari and said, "That's not silk." I thought, "Oh, my sari's not silk," because they clearly got silk saris.

The next day, we were going from the dining room into Shri Mataji's drawing room. Just as I'm walking in, Shri Mataji stops what she's doing and shouts out to me—this is so embarrassing—she says, "It is silk!"

Maybe I'll tell you another similar story. This was at an Adi Shakti Puja in Ganapatipule, and she was giving puja saris to the ladies who had helped organize the puja. When I came up, you're standing in line and you're seeing how one lady was just distributing the saris, picking one up and giving it to the next lady. As I'm getting closer, I made the mistake of just having the thought, "Oh, I'd love to have a heavy pink sari." As I get there to receive my sari, Shri Mataji again stopped what she was doing. She turns to the lady who's giving out the saris, who has already taken one in her hand, and she says, "No, not that one. Give her that one." And this is the one. She gave me a pink sari because she knows what I wanted.

Maybe the last one I'll tell you about is the one I'm wearing. It was again for a puja where she was giving saris to all the ladies. When I came up to receive a sari from her, she motioned to someone for a certain sari that was on the side. They brought that, and she said to me, "This is special for you," and she gave it to me. This was in the mid-to-early '90s. It has scenes from Shri Krishna's life. It has him stealing the butter and chasing. She opened it and said, "See, you can see Shri Krishna's stories on it." So this is also one of my most treasured ones.

That's all for now.

Jai Shri Mataji, everybody. How lovely to share all the wonderful stories, and what a beautiful collection everybody has. I have a small story and a longer, sort of miracle story.

I will start with the first story. In the early pujas, the ladies would often be asked to share saris to decorate. One particular occasion, we were in San Diego having Shri Buddha Puja on the beach—literally on the sand, under a tent. This must have been '87 or '88. There's a lovely talk if you watch the puja itself, and they had made a backdrop of the big banyan tree that Shri Buddha was said to have gotten his realization under. We were all staying in tents on this sandy, very hot beach. I had two small children at the time, and I had only brought my puja sari and maybe one other extra sari in case of need.

This call went out, "We need saris to decorate the stage. Can the Lakshmis come forward and share their saris?" I thought, "Oh, this is such a special, auspicious offering to have your sari used to decorate the stage for the puja. It will imbibe all these beautiful vibrations that Mother will be emitting." But many ladies came forward, and they had embroidered silk saris. What I had brought was this very simple silk sari, which I had bought on my first India tour in '82. It's very lovely, soft, light silk, but it's not fancy in any way. But I thought, "Okay, never mind. I'll just offer this one."

So I surrendered the sari. We went ahead and had puja. Sometime later, they started taking down the saris and said, "Please come and collect your sari." As I went forward, I looked and thought, "Oh, I don't see my sari. It's not in the backdrop; it hasn't been used. That's okay, it doesn't matter." As I was up near the front, someone said, "Do you have a sari?" I described it, and she said, "Oh yes, we used that sari. We wrapped the cushion under Mother's feet." I just went, "Oh!" I could not believe it. I thought, "My goodness, what a blessing, Mother. That was so kind." Ever since, I have never worn this sari again. I get it out and I just lay my head on it. When I just did it now, when I got it out and was bowing on it, it seemed to me that I smelled the fragrance of Shri Mataji. I can't explain it. So this sari is very special to me, and I feel that was a very special gift from Shri Mataji.

Then I have one other story, a miracle story. My daughter was getting married in India. After some time, I suddenly had such a strong feeling. I felt I had to have a new sari for this. I can't explain it; it wasn't a desire. We didn't have money to buy a special sari, but it felt like Mother telling me, "You have to get a new sari for this wedding occasion. You can't wear your wedding sari; it has to be a new sari." And I thought, "What am I going to do?" I'm going to be the mother standing there; I need to have a decent, embroidered silk sari. I didn't have anything other than my wedding sari, and we certainly didn't have money to buy one. I thought, "All right, I'll just go look in my closet and see what's there."

I go and I open the doors to my closet, and I'm looking at the saris. Suddenly, I see this red sari with gold embroidery, like a wedding sari. It has a special standard and beautiful gold thread. It was just an amazing sari. I thought, "What is this sari doing here? How can this be here?" Then I felt it must belong to a friend who had been staying with us before she moved to Austria. I thought somehow it got left behind. So I rang her up and I said, "I found this sari in the cupboard. My daughter is going to get married, and I feel Mother telling me that I need to wear a special sari for the wedding. I wondered, could I borrow your sari?" And she said to me, "It's not my sari. I have all my saris here." I just had no idea how Mother did that. Nobody came to visit us; we lived in a forest far from the collective. This is my miracle sari that Shri Mataji put into my wardrobe. Don't ask me how, but Mother works miracles.

The follow-up to this is we went to India, and my daughter was matched to an Indian boy. On the day of the start of the ceremony, I felt I had to look perfect. I usually try to look nice, but this time I really paid attention to the detail. I put the sari on, I made sure the pleats were perfect, everything looked really fine. I asked someone, "I have to look good. I don't know why, but I have to look good. Do I look good?" And she said, "Yes, you look perfect, dignified and beautiful."

So then we are standing by the fireplace, waiting. The brides and their families were waiting by the fire, and the groom and his family came in. I see them getting closer, and then I see him and his mummy and his daddy. I don't think I'd met them before; it was all quite quick. I watched as his mother came towards us. She turned and she saw me, and I saw her whole face beam. She just looked wonderful. I felt in that moment that it was important for me to show that I understood their culture, that we had respect. I could wear the sari, and in some way, this was reflecting on my daughter, giving her dignity and status in their eyes. In that moment, I knew this is why I had to have this sari. It wasn't for me; it was actually for my daughter.

That is the story of my miracle sari. It is so beautiful how Mother takes care of us in so many small ways, and ways that we don't understand. We don't know the bigger picture, but we just follow our heart, we follow what we feel Mother is telling us, and then we reap the beautiful rewards. Thank you, Mother. Jai Shri Mataji.
