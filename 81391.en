Jai Shri Mataji. Maureen, Felicity, and Jamel from France; Jamel and Maureen from up north in England; and Felicity in Gloucestershire this time. So thank you so much for taking the time and joining us this evening to talk about your times with Shri Mataji herself. We'll start today's interview with a talk that Shri Mataji gave when she visited your house, Jamel, in 1977. The audio quality isn't very good, so please bear with it. The translations are there for those who are watching. So thanks for joining us again.

Jamel, would you like to tell us something about this talk?

Actually, you'll be surprised. Just about 10 days ago, I published an article on medium.com. It's a website where many people write articles; I think even Obama writes on that website. The title of the article was 'Genesis of Sahaja Yoga Recordings.' In the article, I explained everything about how we started recording talks of Shri Mataji and how there were quite a few talks that were not actually recorded. But Douglas did what he could at the time with whatever equipment he had. And I was not even aware that he recorded this talk. I only found out about two years ago when someone wrote to me saying, "There's a talk that was recorded in your house in St. Albans in 1977." I said, "Really?" I couldn't believe it.

And in fact, he did. Maureen was there, of course. Maureen, Pat, Douglas—of course, he was recording—and Gavin and Jane were there as well. And Kevin also was there, Pat's son. I remember that he was using a reel-to-reel machine. It was a very old thing. Interestingly enough, there was another person in India called Mr. Pai, who is Abdul's father, who also did a lot of recording using a reel-to-reel machine. He actually gave all his recordings to Douglas, who managed to record them on proper cassettes because everybody was only using cassettes and we could only distribute through cassettes.

It's just interesting to see how Sahaja Yoga actually progressed from nothing to what we have today. When we talk about the genesis, I think there's an anecdote. Was it Pat who once asked Shri Mataji, "Can you record me?" And she said, "Well, there's no need. We're all here." So the actual task of recording itself was not a priority. It became a priority with time, when we realized that these are historical moments and if we don't record them, they're just going to be lost.

So, just to say quickly about this talk: I'd been in Sahaja Yoga just two or three months, maybe, and Shri Mataji came to St. Albans to where I used to live with other students. Fortunately that weekend, they all left or there was only one colleague of mine who was around. And we decided to have a seminar in the house. It was a beautiful house. It had an extremely beautiful garden with roses, it had everything.

I remember Shri Mataji coming in and I said, "Where would you like to sleep?" And then she looked at the rooms. There were some really big rooms on the first floor. She said, "No, I'll sleep in this room." And she chose the smallest room, which was my room, in fact. I knew why she did that, of course. If she had to vibrate something, it had to be in the room of the Sahaja Yogi. Shri Mataji stayed the weekend; she came on Saturday and left on Sunday. And if you remember, we went to the Greek restaurant in St. Albans. We visited St. Albans. Shri Mataji knelt at the tomb of St. Alban. She said he was the Adi Guru. He was beheaded for his beliefs by the Romans. So there's a tomb of this saint in St. Albans in this cathedral.

Adi Guru, from the Roman times. Was that a saint or a bishop?

He was a Roman soldier, St. Alban.

St. Alban was a Roman soldier?

A Roman soldier. And he was beheaded because of his Christian beliefs. But she said he was an Adi Guru. And she knelt at the tomb. It was quite amazing to see that. I think we were all there. The cathedral was very close to where I was living in those days.

I explained in one of the articles that I wrote that we used to live in what we call 'digs'; in those days we used to share a house with other students. And I think somehow the unconscious chooses the right place for Shri Mataji to come. That place was just the right place. It was a perfect family house. It was very clean and very close to the cathedral. So we could just walk to the cathedral and then we walked to a Greek restaurant where we all had a meal together. And Shri Mataji invited all of us then.

But what I thought was amazing was that Shri Mataji would come all the way to St. Albans and stay with us and have the seminar. I remember it was a Krishna Puja that we had during that seminar weekend. The lounge was downstairs and we had the puja there. There was enough space.

Maureen, do you remember?

Not so detailed as you.

Because I lived there, so I would know more details.

How many people were there at that seminar?

About seven. Gavin and Jane, and Tony, Jamal and I, and Pat, that's six. And Douglas. There might have been someone else, I'm trying to remember, but I don't think so.

Did Christine and Gus come?

I'm not sure they came. Maybe not. No, I think Gus might have gone by then, '77.

No, no, he wasn't gone yet. It was in July. Yeah. It was probably the end of July or very early August. So it's when he'd come back, but he hadn't gone again. He left around the end of September or something like that.

And she came on the train?

Yeah, exactly. She came by train with... what about Gavin? Didn't she come with Gavin? She might have come in Gavin's car. Gavin and Jane's car, I believe. Yes, that's right. Although we had quite a few train journeys and tube journeys with Mother. Amazing.

I remember something where Gavin came to us and gave us the name of a lady, a student they met on the train, and she was interested in Sahaja Yoga. So I think they might have come on the train. Maybe. I'm not sure.

It's weird, isn't it? I was just mentioning that because it's such a unique thing in those early days that Shri Mataji would travel by train. She would go to restaurants. She was really putting herself out there to spread vibrations anywhere that she could because there were so few yogis and the vibrations were very restricted. They were not flowing like they are today.

No, it's true that in those days we didn't have what we have today—cars and all that. That was not at all the case. In fact, Shri Mataji traveled in the tube. I remember once we were sitting in Oxford Street. Do you remember that, Maureen? We were in Oxford Street and we went shopping. We were waiting for a particular bus and there were about 20 or 30 number 73 buses that went past, and we were looking for a 74 or something. At the end, Shri Mataji said, "You see, we're just enjoying ourselves. We're waiting, but we're not bothered anyway."

Also, as you said, we were all very young. When I came later, we were all in our early 20s and you were a student, so nobody really had money or cars except Gavin and Jane, who were older. It was a very different situation then.

So, just to close the subject on St. Albans. That was, to me, it was impressive because it was the first time that Shri Mataji came to a house which I shared with other students, and she would do the same thing, of course, in 1979 when you came, Felicity. And in that talk, it was a puja that we had done. It was probably my second puja because the first one was the Guru Puja on the 1st of July, 1977.

Gavin's house, yeah. Probably the very first Guru Puja.

Was it the first puja? I always thought it was.

It was, other than the pujas that we had at Hersgreen. But that was the first puja without Satpal. It was with Mother telling us what to do.

That's right, yeah, without Satpal, exactly, yes. And it's the one where Mother is sat on the brown sofa with the flowers between her legs.

Exactly, yeah, I remember that.

So you'd had a few simple pujas in Mother's house at Hersgreen, with an Indian pujari there?

Yeah. Basically, Mother stopped him all the time and put him right because he was a priest, he was doing what he knew. And Mother would say, vibrationally, "No." And that's when she laughed and she said, "I'm doing puja to myself," because she was having to tell us what to do and how to do it. That was the puja set with the little jewels hanging around it and the little silver statue. I came across that whole set in the castle some years back during Navratri. It's at the castle in Cabella.

Wow. I talked about that also in my memories. That original set had the Shirdi Sai Nath next to her. And she would actually put water and do the abhishek and all that. Do you remember that?

Absolutely. And her Shri Ganesha, the wooden one.

Tell us more about this puja with Shri Mataji, where Shri Mataji herself is directing everything.

Yeah, absolutely everything. Because we had no idea. Absolutely no idea. We didn't have saris. She gave me a silk sort of scarf and that's wound around me. And that's where those pictures are from, of us all at Hersgreen. Jamal's in that as well. And Kevin's there with his elbow on Mother's knee, nonchalantly.

Nonchalantly.

Well, he was only seven. Those were the times where Shri Mataji in England was a householder and a mother. Whereas in Cabella, it's different. She was more like a guru, a goddess.

But even so, when Mother did the pujas, she was still totally awe-inspiring. She was no longer the mother. I can remember afterwards, going out into the street after that Guru Puja with Mother, and I saw the pavements and the concrete. And I felt like it was a tiny thin layer over the whole pulsating earth that was Mother. And how immense her power was, and how like ants we were in comparison. Just walking out into the streets, you sort of felt like you were going into an artificial area, having come from reality.

Yes. I forgot that when you were in the pujas with Mother, it was so real. She had this amazing power to transport you. Because everything was so ordinary in those days, but then you'd get into this puja with Mother and it was just power, the vibrations, the energy would transport you into a different state. So just like you said, when you would come outside into the world, you were looking at it from this heightened awareness and you could see that this was just a kind of Maya. It was really profound.

And I think because the vibrations outside were so blah and heavy—they weren't really vibrations—the contrast was real.

Maureen, can you talk about how you decided to try and advertise using those leaflets at the Body and Mind exhibition?

Yeah. Well, the Body and Mind exhibition was the first time they'd ever had one. And we sort of got all excited and said, "We can go there and we can do something." And Mother encouraged us. To have any kind of stand there was certainly outside of our means; we had no money, full stop. I think Gavin printed stuff up for us in his office and we decided we'd go. We also took water pistols with vibrated water to vibrate the place. That was Pat and Kevin. So they could get away with it.

And Finn, at the time, had gone off, but he heard what we were doing and he said, "You lot are hopeless. You'll never get this done. I'll come and help you."

So that's Finbar, your younger brother.

Finbar. Yes. My younger brother. Of musical and Vilamba fame nowadays.

And he was not a yogi then?

Not a yogi. Not at all. He'd gone off for 10 years, but he couldn't help being drawn. Pat and I used to go home most weekends and we'd put oil on our heads and kumkum, and my poor parents, heaven knows what they thought was going on. And Finn would sort of be kind of detached from it to some degree, but he couldn't help the pull. When he heard us discussing it, he felt that we were so hopeless he had to come and help us. But again, it was that pull; he wanted to be involved. So how could he do it? By appearing to help. He was so young, I think he was 17, perhaps. I was 21 when I met Mother, so he was about 16 or 17. It was very difficult. All his friends were sort of going off the rails and he just got pulled away. But because he saw us every weekend, he had that connection. And so he did. And he did a very special thing, bringing Jamal. So there you go.

Tell us the story about the vibrated water and water pistols.

Well, we were going around this place and it was full of so-called seeking things. They were all pretty sort of gross at that point. Good in a way, because they weren't full-blown. They had things like, do you remember those plants? They had these machines that were supposed to be able to feel your presence when you went in there and they'd react. So we all went in there and meditated and the plants all completely calmed down. Because when most people went there, the machines went crazy.

For us, in a way, we were almost experimenting with how Sahaja Yoga worked, because we didn't know. I know the first time Mother told me how to put your hands towards something to see what it was like. They had a poster of the TM guy. I put my hands to it and felt like I'd been bitten. That's how I learned that you should not put your hands towards everything. But things were so gross then. Like Felicity says, the extremes were there. You'd be with Mother and you'd be in a completely different realm. And then you'd go back to your squat and your hippie friends. You were living in two worlds, really.

Whereas now it doesn't feel like that. Now you can be yourself. You can be a yogi. Vibrations flow out of you. And you still witness and you can see the rubbish that's going on, but somehow we're able to be part of it now. It's mainstream to be a seeker now. In fact, people are desperate. So it's so hard to explain to people how really different it was then and how basic. Literally, Shri Mataji was the only one with vibrations.

What I didn't understand was why people didn't see Mother as we did. When we went to places like Oxford Street and went in a department store, I would just stare at these people serving her, waiting for them to go, "Oh, my God!" But they didn't. They just served her. I just couldn't understand how they couldn't see who she was. I guess it was the Maya of Mother's human presence and that they weren't seeking. For us, we were looking, we were seeking. So I feel like the Kundalini recognized Mother then.

Absolutely. But I was just quite young. I just couldn't understand why they didn't. I couldn't understand how people would get realization. I took a group of friends when I got it and they would feel it, but then they didn't want to stick with it. It just didn't touch them in their depth. Still happens now, doesn't it?

But Jamal, how did you get to know about Shri Mataji?

I was just going to explain that. First, I have to thank Finbar because he's the one who volunteered to give those leaflets. I picked up one of those leaflets—it was just two typed A4 sheets stapled together—and I put it in my pocket. I don't know how I didn't throw it away. I just read it on the train when I went back to St. Albans. What I read about the fact that there was something about Kundalini, and about Shri Mataji, who could not only give you self-realization but you could feel your chakras, you could go into collective consciousness... I became so curious because I was already seeking. I was about to go and see if I could find a guru.

And just when I was about to find something, I got this leaflet which explained everything. I remember I put that leaflet under my bed and from time to time, I would just read the content. Then after two weeks, with a bit of courage, I called the number at the end of that leaflet. It was Gavin who responded, and he said, "Okay, you can come to my place." It was close to Euston Square, which was perfect because my train brings me to St. Pancras and from there I could walk to his place.

When I arrived there, it was a very humble place. It's just a flat with these big, huge sash windows facing south. There was a lot of sun. Gavin received me and said, "Just sit down." I sat down and at some point, I could see he did some gesture and I thought, "That's a bit strange." He must have been doing some bandhan. There was a picture of Shri Mataji on the mantelpiece. I sat on the settee on the right side of the door, and Shri Mataji would sit on this sort of half-raised bed on the left as you go into the lounge. And then Gavin said, "Okay, Shri Mataji is going to come. You can just sit here." At some point, everybody rushed to the windows and Shri Mataji arrived by taxi, I think.

And then she came out. When I saw Shri Mataji, I thought, "She's not a human being." I was so awed by her presence. I even bowed like everybody in front of her, which I would never normally do. Being from a Muslim background, you would never actually bow to a human being. But when I saw Shri Mataji, I was just absolutely awestruck. Then, Shri Mataji asked me where I came from and so on.

And then she gave a speech. What was fantastic about it was, Shri Mataji gave a speech as if she was talking to millions of people in front of her. I remember she was talking about the 'isms.' She was talking about all these isms, like capitalism, and explaining how all that was just false knowledge and that you needed to be in the center and be one with the unconscious. She used to talk a lot about the unconscious then, much more than she did later. She wanted to use a vocabulary which was more scientific, which people could understand more easily, as opposed to using Sanskrit words and describing things in a way that people may not identify with.

But what was amazing also is how I knew that I was in good hands when Maureen and Pat came to work on me. Both of you, I think, worked on me. Shri Mataji came after a while and then she said, "What is that hand of Fatima?"

You were sat on a chair and it wasn't clearing, it wasn't moving. And she just said, "What's that around your neck?" And you got it out, didn't you?

Yeah, and I said, "This is the hand of Fatima." And then you said the Kundalini shot up. But I couldn't feel it then. In fact, I felt everything afterwards.

So you were wearing a necklace? Just a hand?

We asked Shri Mataji later, "Why do people worship the hand of Fatima?" She said, "Because that was the only thing they could see," because she had the parda.

Then what happened was, Shri Mataji decided to massage my head with Silvikrin. And that made a heck of a difference. Because for three days, while I was working in college doing experiments—I was doing aeronautics and I was doing experiments with a wind tunnel—I was feeling just coolness coming out of my head for three days. And then, of course, you were absolutely convinced. You're something completely different. You're not what you used to be, and you know that you can feel vibrations. You actually are aware of these vibrations.

So you got the realization and Mother was massaging your head and then you went back to college.

Yeah, I went back to school. And for several days, I was just feeling the coolness. I think that came from that massage. But what was amazing, my colleagues thought I was a gone case. They said, "We really need to save him." There's something wrong with me because I started telling them, "Can you feel the vibrations coming from these roses?" We had some roses. I was doing my revisions for the final year exams. And they said, "Wow, he's feeling vibrations from roses. There's something wrong."

And then gradually, I was looking forward to going to Gavin's place every Sunday for the program. Imagine that Shri Mataji would come from Hersgreen, which was way south in Surrey, taking the train all the way to Victoria, then taking a taxi, coming to Gavin's place for a handful of yogis.

For a handful of yogis. Absolutely, a handful, yeah.

It used to be just nine, ten people. And then, of course, we had some newcomers. Gordon, I remember Gordon, the dentist.

Sunday afternoon, Mother would come and spend it with you.

Yeah, she would do that. And sometimes she would cook food and bring it with her in a kind of tiffin box. It was amazing that Shri Mataji really nurtured us like children.

So motherly, so motherly. Just like a mother would.

She was so motherly. And I think we enjoyed—I'm sorry to say this to the Italians, but we enjoyed the best times with Shri Mataji, definitely. And Maureen was even luckier than me, because obviously they were with her for at least two or three years before I arrived. You were there since '75, so you must have enjoyed some fabulous moments with Shri Mataji.

And we continued. But what Maureen didn't tell you is that when we felt vibrations around things, whether it was false gurus or people who had followed false gurus, we became experts. We could tell which false guru someone came from.

Yeah, it's true. You could tell the cause. If you had a pain in the Swadistan, for instance, depending on which part of the Swadistan, you knew which false guru it was, whether it was Maharishi or Muktananda. So each of the false gurus was damaging their chakras in a specific way.

I remember the TMs, because the people who'd been to TM were always catching on left Nabhi, left Vishuddhi, and I can't remember the third one. Maybe left heart. All the TM people...

Agnya.

Agnya, yes. And so in that same way, you're saying that each of these false gurus targeted specific chakras to damage in humans.

But actually, we were, in a way... can we say that we were guinea pigs?

Yes.

Because you see, when people came for their self-realization, there was no guarantee that we could give them self-realization. We could work on them, but sometimes it didn't work. And the other thing which people don't realize now, because we're much stronger, is that in those days, when these new people came, we were rolling down with terrible pains. The Agnya, remember these TMs when they used to come? We were absolutely in pain. And we used to have terrible headaches. And then gradually, it started to subside after a few months. After they got cleared, we became vaccinated.

I know, at the end of the Caxton Hall meeting, you'd be finished, working on row after row of people who had been to awful places.

All the newcomers in those days were coming from false gurus. TMers, all these others.

It's true. Because even when I came in '79, I remember this guy, somebody brought a Mormon to the ashram. And he was trying to kind of convert us and convert Shri Mataji. And Mother was very gracious and just kind of let him go on and on. And then eventually he left, and she said, "Now see, you see where he was catching." She was like teaching us about how to handle these people who'd been to false gurus.

Yeah, those were fascinating days, whatever it is. I remember I had a colleague, remember that colleague I brought, Maureen, from St. Albans? He was an Algerian fellow. His name was Ned. He's just retired, but he became a very prominent professor of thermodynamics in Canada and a big researcher who became quite famous. But we couldn't give him self-realization. No way. We tried everything we could. Kundalini just wouldn't... his chakras were just so blocked and he didn't have the desire.

No, the Agnya was blocked. We couldn't go past the Agnya.

To find us, Jamel, you were a student at the University of Hatfield. How old were you?

Hatfield. Oh, when I came to Sahaja Yoga, I must have been 23.

So when were you born, Jamel?

'53. April '54. I know you're a scorpion. I remember Mother saying scorpions can go 180 degrees. That's what she told me about you.

Scorpions have a problem. They can have a problem.

So when you came, Jamel, you must have been like the first Muslim to come. Did Shri Mataji talk to you? I remember when Grazyna came and she was from Poland, Mother went, "Oh, now we can work out the Polish because we have a yogi who's from Poland. I can clear her chakras." So I'm thinking, did she talk to you a bit about the Muslim religion?

She did, yeah. She spoke on different occasions on the Muslims. The one thing that I remember most was when she said, "You cannot imagine how much we suffered during the Muslim era because..."

Oh, we've lost him. The signal dropped for him.

...Just to continue on what I was saying earlier. But let me just say something to explain the context. The context is we were very lucky. I mean, Maureen was even luckier than me. We had Shri Mataji very close to us. We were so often with her that we spent so many hours with her in Ashley Gardens, in Hersgreen also, but much later even in Brompton Square. I remember when she was in Ashley Gardens in particular, because she was renovating the flat, we used to be in the Finchley Ashram. She used to call in the morning and say, "Please come to my place in Victoria." So we used to go every morning and then run out at lunchtime when C.P. comes, and then come back just after he's gone. We were like little rats, always around Shri Mataji. And I remember when she was renovating the flat, we often spent time and had lunches at McDonald's next to Westminster Cathedral.

I remember she was talking about Islam and she said, "You can't imagine how much we suffered during that time because we used to travel on camelbacks. And camels, they sort of go up and down. It's a very, very arduous kind of travel. You can't imagine also how violent people were. In those days, if you said anything, they would just take out their sword and cut your head. It was so violent." And she said, "You don't know, now we've got human rights and you can sit peacefully, even just sitting in McDonald's." She used to like the McFish, by the way, for those who are interested. A strawberry milkshake and an apple pie.

What she said was, "You can't imagine that today we're actually able to just sit peacefully and talk to each other peacefully and have human rights. You're in an environment which is completely different from what it was in the times of the Prophet." And then she said when she came, she incarnated; part of her Shakti was in the Prophet and the other part was in Fatima.

Fatima is Prophet Muhammad's daughter.

Yes, Fatima is the daughter. And she explained how the Prophet tried to balance the Kundalini as much as possible. So he brought Hassan and Hussain, Ali and Fatima, and they're all actually left and right, if you look at that. Fatima is more sort of Mahalakshmi or on the left Nabhi. Ali is more on the right side as Brahmadeva. Hassan is, I think he's Buddha, and Hussain is Mahavira, or the other way around. In any case, she said he did a lot to balance the Kundalini and he did a lot for the evolution of our subtle being. And she said many other things.

So if I may ask, you'd come from a Muslim background from Algeria. You were a student in England. You felt the magic of Shri Mataji. You could feel the vibrations. For those viewers who are watching from an Islamic background, is there anything that you had in conversation with Shri Mataji that you think might be...

Well, one of the things that we asked Shri Mataji was why the Prophet tried to forbid Muslims from worshipping idols. Because that's the first thing that happens when you come to Sahaja Yoga. You realize that now you have a consciousness that allows you to discriminate between what has vibrations and what doesn't, what is holy and what is unholy. The first encounter I had with idols was when we went to Hersgreen. Shri Mataji invited us to her house. I remember Pat showing me this statue of Shri Ganesha, which was later placed in Chelsham Road. And he said, "You know, you can feel the vibrations. It's really cool." And I was trying to feel the vibrations. At the same time, I had this conditioning in me that says you're not supposed to be putting your hands towards an idol.

But gradually, because Pat and Maureen and Douglas were very, very sweet, they managed to inculcate into me that reality, which I didn't have. Then we did ask Shri Mataji why the Prophet asked Muslims not to worship any idols. She said one of the reasons is that Hindus went too far into idol worship. So, he was trying to create a bit of a balance by saying, "Forget about idols. Just worship the formless." But when you are in Sahaja Yoga, it's a different situation. As I said, if a Muslim listens to us, he will ask questions. How can we talk about idols? But then, we have to think that there are idols that have good vibrations. You can actually feel their vibrations. You're not necessarily worshipping them; you're just feeling their vibrations. It's different. You're not worshipping the idol; you're worshipping the vibrations that may be sitting in that idol. And you can actually feel it. You have that discriminating power which you didn't have before, which you don't have if you're just a Muslim and you have no self-realization.

Which is possible because of self-realization.

It's only possible because you have that collective consciousness.

And the vibrations are coming from the Divine. So what you're feeling in that statue of Shri Ganesha, you're feeling the Divine in that statue because it has these vibrations, like the swayambhus.

Exactly. But still, it tells you something very important: that all these holy places that people go and spend so much money to visit, whether it is Kashi or Mecca, you realize after a while that you've got them inside yourself. You don't need... because Shri Mataji is inside. Even in those days, if you needed to go to Hajj or to Mecca, you could go to a puja and you had a billion times more vibrations than you could ever get in Mecca.

Because the times have changed. Muhammad came at that time for a specific purpose, to establish the Dharma and the balance.

Exactly. And to prepare the way for Mother's incarnation, too. He came, Muhammad, to prepare the way so that we would have balance in our beings, so that we could receive the self-realization and recognize and understand what the Divine was giving us through Mother.

Okay, going back to you as a student, Jamel, and in a house share, how did your life change besides that subtle awareness and that absolute magic where Shri Mataji massaged your head with Silvikrin?

There is a miracle. The very first miracle, the most important miracle, is that before I came to Sahaja Yoga, I used to have some psychosomatic problems, some left-sided things that I must have caught when I was in Algeria. Because my mom, in her goodness, she thought it's not a bad idea to go and see a sorcerer.

What, like witchcraft?

Witchcraft. They do some kind of witchcraft. And I remember she was taking me to this lady who was working with some kind of witchcraft. I don't know what she was doing. I was a kid, only five years old or something. And I think I must have caught something there. By the age of 15 or 16, I started feeling these very bad left-side problems, these psychosomatic things. But the doctors never found anything. I remember going to a special medical check for pilots because I was almost going to be learning to fly with an airline. The doctors never saw any problems. I was actually qualified to become a pilot. And yet, inside, I knew I was not all right.

And Shri Mataji, much later, she said, "I saved you from all those problems. I sorted it out." I remember she worked so much on us. Sometimes she said, "I had to go so much into your left side. And some of these bhoots, they just hide so far into the left side."

So through this witchcraft, negative energy had been absorbed into your body without you realizing it.

But she really worked on us and she really saved us. She sorted all that out. And you can feel the difference. It's a massive difference between what you feel before and after. And I think perhaps the Divine has its tricks so that it can show you that it has improved your life, so that you realize how important Sahaja Yoga is.

But I think we were very lucky because we could have been like many of those who came in the late '70s to Caxton Hall. Many of them didn't stay in Sahaja Yoga. They just left. Many of them came from false gurus and were not able to accept Sahaja Yoga fully. But we were so lucky.

Yes, because it's lifetimes of punyas that Shri Mataji has kept us as her children for so long and hopefully forever. I remember Maureen sharing how Shri Mataji had pinned your kundalini up for months.

Yes, absolutely. For the first six months, she pinned it up. And I was just completely there and just protected. Absolutely protected. Because the environment I was in was so dangerous. It was hippies, it was drug addicts, heroin addicts. We were squatting. And we'd go from that to Mother and back again. She saved my life. I was days off from falling into the deepest pit ever.

I came to Tolmers Square, you remember? I think I went to Douglas' room.

Oh, yeah. Dougie had a council flat, but it was still crazy. He made some tea for me, I remember, in Tolmers Square.

I remember his alarm clock system. I stayed there one night. And in the morning, at four or five o'clock, the lights would start flashing and there was music—a wake-up call for early meditation.

That's really something early in the morning in England, isn't it? With all the darkness most of the time.

Yeah, that's right. It was so dark. It was really hard to get up early in those days. It was really heavy.

Sleep was our national favourite sport in those days.

It was. Eating and sleeping. Because we'd given up every other vice.

Mataji would cook for you.

She cooked. She cooked at Hersgreen. I remember her cooking at Hersgreen for us.

And she'd always buy the sweets from Ambala for the puja. And we'd just have one piece of Ambala as a prasad. I always think that when we have armfuls of prasad, you only need one piece. Each puja would take you to a level whereby the food and the prasad... it was like being in paradise and you didn't need it. Then afterwards, you'd come down and be on your own and think, "Oh, that was so amazing and I didn't have it because I didn't want it at the time." You literally went to a place where you didn't need to eat.

That's right. When the vibrations are really strong, you don't feel hungry. You're just completely satisfied. And Mother would stay over at Gavin's as well sometimes. So we'd all sleep on the floor around the sofa.

She was giving a talk once. Dougie recorded it, and it's on the Vishuddhi. It's an audio. She started it at about 11 o'clock at night and we were just falling off. And then by midnight, we were absolutely clear as a bell and completely cleared out. It was incredible.

But the best story was the one of the Mahjong game. You remember that one?

Which one?

We were playing a Chinese game called Mahjong with Pat and Maureen. And Shri Mataji, when she came for the program on Sunday, she said, "God, you're all in these bhoots." And then she worked on us virtually for 24 hours non-stop.

Sleeping with broken hands all night. It was...

So when I see Mahjong, I steer clear of it.

Why do you think that was? What was it about it?

Well, in Hong Kong, they bet with it. It's like the men play it very fast. It's a gambling thing. So it brought with it some other things.

That happened quite a bit in the early days. You would just do things or go somewhere innocently, not knowing, and come back and Mother would say, "Where have you been? What have you been doing? Because you've got all caught up now." I remember when she came back from India one time, it must have been in '79 or '80. She said to one of the yogis, "What has happened? Your whole agnya's gone." And he said, "Oh, I was just thinking, Mother." She'd been gone for like two months, and she goes, "No, no."

There was this story where the cooking was going on in the kitchen and then she...

Yes, yes. So, this is at Jamel's. It was in Hatfield. Give us the background, Jamel, because I can't quite remember the details.

Yeah. The way it happened was I had finished my bachelor's and I came back to Hatfield to do an MPhil research with the possibility of doing a PhD.

Aeronautical engineering you were doing?

I was doing research in aerodynamics. And we managed to get a house with some other colleagues from the university in Hatfield, in a place very close to Hatfield but in the country. It was a secluded place. The owner who lived there was quite a nice man and he had built this house next to his own house. It was a very beautiful, big house. It had a large kitchen and beautiful rooms.

One day, Shri Mataji wanted to do some programs. I think she went to Cambridge as well. I said, "Okay, then in that case, you can stop at my place." So she came with other yogis. It was Tony, Rustem, yourself. There were about ten of us.

We did a little mini tour.

So they stopped at my place and Shri Mataji slept in my room. We had a small program and she gave a few colleagues realization. That was on the way to Cambridge. A few days later, on the way back, she stopped also at my place in Hatfield, in a place called Apple Cross. I remember that it was an unexpected stop, which made it slightly tricky for us because we didn't have all the food. We hadn't prepared anything. We went to the kitchen and tried to find a way of cooking something with the few ingredients we had.

I was still in the room, in the living room with Shri Mataji. Bala was there. And we were just sitting around Shri Mataji and she was just chatting. And then just suddenly, she said, "Oh, they're taking a long time. Why are they taking a long time?"

Yeah, that's right. We were at a loss. We didn't know what to do because it was already eight o'clock in the evening. We just came back in a big thunderstorm.

She's sitting there and she suddenly said, "It's taking so long. Let's go see what they're doing." And she jumped up, literally kind of leapt up, went into the kitchen and took over. She made this special dish with rice and yogurt. And then we all sat around the table.

That's what I remember because as we sat down around the table—it was like an old farmhouse kitchen with a very long table—Mother sat at one end, and I suddenly was overcome with this sensation. I felt this historical depth of vibration and I felt, "Oh, this must have been what it was like when they had their Last Supper." It had that... somehow it carried that vibration. It was a very deep experience for me.

Was that sweet or savory, if I may ask? The yogurt and rice dish.

Savory. It was a supper dinner dish.

The amazing thing is, before the end of the dinner, someone asked Shri Mataji, "What is hell?" And Shri Mataji said, "I can't tell you now, but once we finish the dinner, I'll let you know." And then once we finished, she said, "Actually, hell is the excrement system of God."

Oh. The dregs. The discards. It's not very good to be in hell.

The next day, Shri Mataji slept in my room, which was a very big room. And we asked Mother if we could sleep around there. We had a nice wall-to-wall carpet which was virtually brand new, so we all slept there on the floor. And then the next morning, I remember Tony cut her nails.

He really liked to do that, didn't he? Because he understood the deep spiritual significance of the nails. He really understood Mother as a Devi, as a goddess.

But what's the significance of cutting her nails?

Well, what he used to do, he used to take the nails. I think he used to bury them somewhere. In those days, I don't think they understood that protocol. Later on, we understood that because when Mother was staying in a hotel, the ladies would go in after her visit and carefully find any hairs on the bedding and save them and then give them back to her. But we, in the early years, we didn't understand that protocol. But I do remember Tony being very careful about the fingernails and also Mother's hair because he was aware that each one carried so much vibration. I know that quite a few things were buried in the garden at Chelsham Road.

The other thing that happened then, if you remember, Felicity, was the next day in the morning. Shri Mataji was just leaving the house and she said, "Okay, can you bury this coconut?" We had a coconut that she vibrated. She said, "Can you bury it next to the entrance door?" As I came out, I started burying this coconut and the landlord was walking past. He came to see us and he said, "Oh, that won't grow here." We explained that this is more something that will have good vibrations, will clear out the place. And then Shri Mataji actually shook his hand. He had had a stroke and she said, "Yes, I knew." So she stroked his hand. She said, "I think it will certainly improve him now that I've shaken his hand." And then when she went into the car, she said, "Why don't you consider me to be also Prophet Muhammad?"

Well, what I remember is, she sat in the car and she turned to you with the window down and she suddenly... it's like she pulled her hair. She said, "I can have a beard as well," and she put her hair around her face. And I remember her turning to you and saying, "Is that better now?"

Yeah, that's right. That was because she said, "I can have a beard as well. See, I can put my hair around."

With this story, I'm afraid we've jumped two years later, literally. So we need to also have a session where we can speak about the first ashram.

Hello, whose daughter is she?

This is Mercy's daughter. This is Snow.

Oh, hello, Snow. How are you?

Anyway, so we've jumped to '79. We need to really talk about the time between Gavin's and all the way to...

Please do. I wanted to ask if Shri Mataji mentioned something about the cathedral in St. Albans because we remember reading about it in the recollection stories that you had contributed. So would you like to take us through those intervening two years, please?

What I can remember from the story of the cathedral, and I think Maureen came with us as well, is that Shri Mataji said she wanted to visit to pay respect to St. Alban. So we went to the cathedral, which was very close. We went on foot. And she knelt in front of the tomb of St. Alban. It was quite amazing to see that because it's not often that you see Shri Mataji actually kneeling down. She spoke very highly of St. Alban.

And there is another anecdote, which maybe not many people know, is that when you go from St. Albans to London, the train takes you to St. Pancras. And St. Pancras was also a Roman. He was executed or beheaded by the Romans for his Christian beliefs. It's amazing that there's a connection between St. Albans and St. Pancras. And he was only 14 years old, St. Pancras.

But then after that, of course, we had many other stories. The fact that Shri Mataji arranged for the very first ashram to open. It was in Acton Lane. We must have stayed there just two months. And we were what, five or six yogis? Pat, myself, Maureen, Christine, Gus. I think that was it. It was a small flat, but it had amazing vibrations. Whenever someone came into the house, you could feel them coming. If someone was close to the flat, or they were just about to arrive through the door, you could actually feel their vibrations. We used to meditate religiously every morning, very early with all the mantras. I remember we used to sing all the mantras.

And then we went to Finchley after that. I went to join for a couple of months and then came back. In Finchley, I found Gregoire had joined us. We had David Baxter. Gus had left; he went back to Australia. And Lindsay was there. Do you remember Lindsay? Lindsay was there as well from Australia. And Pat, of course, was there. And Christine still.

Had Marie come by then?

Not yet. She was living in France. She used to come. She came before me with Gus in '75, a few months before. Then she brought me. But then she got stuck in France for two years because of her hippie past. They wouldn't let her back into England. She kept trying to come.

She had a drug conviction or something like that?

Yeah, something. She couldn't get back. And it drove her crazy because obviously Mother was here. But she was there in the early part, but she wasn't in the ashrams.

So we had Acton Lane, then we had Finchley from about October. And Finchley, we had probably until September 1978. I started uni in '78, and we hadn't been in Finchley very long at that time. I was going to uni from Finchley. It was a huge journey from Finchley all the way to East London and back every day. Eventually, I moved to East London.

The same with me. I left Finchley probably in June '78. And I went to Hatfield. But I think the most striking thing about '78 was the fact that every morning Shri Mataji would call the ashram.

She would talk to me and Gregoire. I had a grant to go to university, but I hadn't started my course yet, so I was free. Gregoire and myself, we used to go to Ashley Gardens every morning and Shri Mataji would correct Gregoire.

Yeah, he was writing The Advent and I was typing. She was virtually crossing everything out. Absolutely everything. Every day. But sometimes, when he wasn't around, she'd say, "I'm crossing all this for his ego." It was so funny.

Those were the times when we spent a lot of time with Shri Mataji in Ashley Gardens. She worked on us for hours on end.

When she called you in the morning, what would she say?

She would say, "Come, come, come. Come along now." And we would go.

So you'd spend the whole day there?

Yeah, we would spend the whole day there. We would have tea or chai, snacks, and lunch. It depends. At the beginning it was just renovation. But when they actually moved into Ashley Gardens, we used to sort of leave at lunchtime when C.P. was coming. After a while, Shri Mataji explained to us that C.P. wanted to have a bit of privacy, so it was important for us not to disturb them during weekends. It's amazing how much we put C.P. through. And Shri Mataji also had this knack of getting Sahaja Yogis to come during weekends because she would have the excuse of saying, "Okay, let's move some furniture around. Come and move furniture." I remember once I saw C.P. and he was going past and I said, "C.P., you don't do anything." He said, "No, I don't. I'm a witness." And Shri Mataji said, "Don't believe him. Don't believe him."

Those were times when Shri Mataji also invited a lot of people who were friends of C.P. I remember she even gave realization to the high court judge who was at The Hague in Holland. This guy came, she gave him realization, he even did a foot soak. She gave realization to so many people. And there were so many people who were sick.

I remember one person. Shri Mataji was busy going to a reception and she said, "There's a lady, an Indian lady in the Royal Hospital." I think that's where Douglas worked. The Royal Hospital in Hampstead. She said, "Can you go and work on her? She's in a coma." We went with another yogi, I can't remember who went with me. We took some lemons and we worked on her for quite a while. Then we left the lemons next to her head. And before we finished, she opened her eyes. She was out of her coma. Then Shri Mataji went the next day and finished the job. And that lady invited us to a dinner party to thank Shri Mataji. She was hopping around. Shri Mataji said, "You should have been there. You worked on her." It was amazing to see. We didn't necessarily realize how powerful we were. But we worked on these people and they just resuscitated, even though they were in a coma.

There were many other people that Shri Mataji worked on in Ashley Gardens. Mrs. Mehra, you remember Mrs. Mehra? She was an Indian lady. She had cancer and Shri Mataji used to work on her every day for about an hour or so. But she still passed away because she didn't have that reverence.

I remember one family of Syrians. Rustam was there. They brought this boy who had kidney failure; he was on dialysis. We worked on him for at least a couple of hours with Shri Mataji. We said all the Bija mantras. We did everything that was possible. But unfortunately, we didn't manage to sort him out. And at the end, I remember Rustam saying, "I'm afraid Shri Mataji, he didn't have the reverence towards Shri Mataji for him to receive the blessings."

If he didn't have that recognition or that understanding of Mother, they don't open themselves.

The boy should have had some reverence. He was 19 or 20 years old, so he was grown up. He could understand and judge who Shri Mataji was and how much she was working. And it just didn't work out. It's just like giving self-realization. Not everybody could get it.

I come from Lucknow, where we have a confluence of Hindu-Muslim culture. In the Lucknow collective, my mom told me how a Muslim family came with a bed-bound child to the center. This is in the last 10 years. And they had this faith, this absolute rock-solid faith that Shri Mataji would cure the child. And a few visits later, they came with that child actually walking and meditating. So after so many years, that recognition and the faith is such a thing.

It's good to know that you are from Lucknow because we went to Lucknow in 1998, I think. There was a big conference on Sahaja Yoga for the Muslims.

Yes, it was. We saw it on the video with Shankar Jain. We were watching that Lucknow visit because he also went, I think on the '98 tour, after the birthday puja. Some of the Western yogis went to Lucknow to talk about Sahaja Yoga.

And C.P.'s family were from Lucknow.

Yes, that's right. There were a lot of miracles in those early years of Mother curing. I remember her talking about curing this young boy with his arm. It was somehow severed and the skin grew back and joined. Every so often we'd hear these stories. Rustam was often recounting them. I didn't see them myself, but there was a lot of curing going on.

So, Sushmita, do you want to continue or should we have another session?

I have one quick question. I remembered you were telling us, Jamal, how you studied aerodynamics. I remember saying to you, "Oh, we went to Sherborne Abbey with Shri Mataji." She looked up at the buttresses in the ceiling and she explained to us... we were standing there, I had a guidebook, looking up at these huge stone buttresses in the roof. And she casually says, looking up, "Oh, I wonder how they made those." I thought, "Oh, Mother wants to know how they make those," so I start flipping through the guidebook. And within a very short time, she went, "Oh, well actually..." and then she explained the whole thing to us. I remember thinking, "Of course, Mother knows everything. She's the source of all knowledge." I related this story to you and you said yes, and then you talked about how you'd had all these conversations with her about aerodynamics. Can you talk about that a bit?

Yes. We were talking about the effects of airflow. When you have airflow along the airfoil of the plane, you have what we call a laminar layer, which sticks to the plane. And then you have a turbulent layer, which starts to become very arbitrary. You have to have statistics to actually predict the speed of air around the wing, because the air is not laminar anymore. We call it turbulent because it goes into rolls and starts to almost disintegrate on the wing. And Shri Mataji said, "Oh, that's where the vibrations actually control... that air is actually controlled by vibrations." She was explaining a lot of things about airworthiness and how planes fly. She was explaining how Shri Hanuman is the one who helps the aero industry and helps planes fly. She said, "If you're scared..." Because one day she looked at me, she said, "Why are you scared of flying?" And I failed to tell her that it was because I knew too much about how they were built and how they were maintained. And that really scares you a bit. "Why are you scared?" she said. And then from then on, that fear just left.

Did she ever talk to you about how in Shri Rama's time, they had flying machines?

We didn't talk about the Pushpak and all that. No. I think she talked to other Sahaja Yogis about it. She said that in those days, they used a kind of energy that later on humans abused and they lost it. It would come back one day and we may be able to use that different kind of energy. But apparently, she said one thing—which I didn't hear directly, but someone told me—that the way we propel airplanes is a very primitive way. It's a bit like taking two boilers in the sky and heating up the air and getting it to thrust through these jet engines. She feels that the way we propel our planes today is not so sophisticated. She feels that it's really backward, which is understandable when you think of how much it is polluted and how much fumes you're getting from one engine. You can imagine how backward we are in that respect.

Well, if you want, we can maybe schedule another session.

Yes. And have Pat join you.

Before you sign off, thank you so much for today's session, Maureen, Felicity. Thank you for organizing this.

Thank you. Thank you, Felicity. Thank you, Shri Mataji for everything. And yes, we must have a part two and we will be in touch about that. Thank you once again.
