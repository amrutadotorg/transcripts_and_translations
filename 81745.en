Visit
Genoa (Italy) | Transcript (English) - NOT needed
Mother, we would like to offer you a humble poem to thank you for your visit in Rome, because since you came to Rome, all these miracles happen every day.

Mother, since you arrived that night,
Life's an everlasting instant of paradise.
Everywhere we are surrounded by the light,
Constantly overflowing from your ineffable eyes.

A moment of bliss, as sweet as a sleeping child
Awakened by an angel's kiss.
A wonderful chain of coincidence
With a blessing treasure in each ring.

A notion of nectar and innocence
That drenches in its fragrance everything.
A moment of peace, eternal and still.
Joyful as birds that heavenly sing.

Beautiful and simple as a flower on a hill.
Majestic as the word of our enlightened king.

Mother, our burning desire is to offer you the highest crown
So that the world, one and entire,
At your lotus feet will bow down.
