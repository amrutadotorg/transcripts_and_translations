Jai Shri Mataji.

Interviewer: Jai Shri Mataji. So it's our pleasure to have you, uncle, Dr. Suresh Nigam, on this auspicious occasion of Shri Hanuman Janmotsav today on the 12th of April, 2025. It's great to talk about how Shri Mataji took Sahaja Yoga to what was then the USSR. You were involved right from the beginning in this adventure, in this exploration with Shri Mataji. Would you please tell us, uncle, in English and in Hindi, about how the whole scenario unfolded? What did Shri Mataji say? How did it come about? And when, please?

Dr. Nigam: To begin with, all I know is that in 1989, I was told by Shri Mataji, "Dr. Nigam, you and Dr. Rai have to go to Russia because they need many Sahaja Yogis there." I didn't know at that point that an MOU had been signed with the government of Russia. When we reached there, we came to know that the Russian government had taken the initiative to bring some spirituality into the country. They had learned from the Indian embassy that there are many gurus in India, and they sent some people to Rishikesh as well. It was good luck that some people showed the Russian officials odd photographs of the Rajneesh Ashram, so they rejected Rajneesh and invited us. And that is how we went there.

Interviewer: Just to give some background for listeners from the current generation who would have no idea that at that time, it was the USSR, not Russia as we know it now. And it was a totally communist country, which was atheist. There was no faith for people to follow as such. This is where the government of Russia, as you were saying, was exploring ways to bring religion into the country because of their then-president, Gorbachev, who was a realized soul. Because India is the land of spirituality, it's known the world over, they had sent their emissaries to see which gurus could come for an international conference on yoga.

Dr. Nigam: Yes, this international conference was held at Yalta, in Ukraine, and Shri Mataji was also there. The house was full. When Shri Mataji presented and then came out, I think about 80% of the people came out with her. The hall was empty. That was the first thing.

The second thing is that Shri Mataji was received by many doctors there. I remember there was a meeting in a big hall, and about 500 doctors came. They had heard by that time that there is something like Sahaja Yoga which is just like pure science. So when Shri Mataji started talking about meta-science and all this terminology, the doctors started saying, "Mother, please give us Realization first!" That was the reaction of the medical doctors.

After that, it spread like wildfire. Everywhere we went—Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Togliatti, and many other places—it was unbelievable. I tell you, I've been in Sahaja Yoga for the last 45 years. The amount of vibrations we felt in Russia was unlike anywhere else, not even in India. It was like this. We were four people; two would go to Moscow, two would go to Leningrad. We used to have a public program almost every day.

Interviewer: So this was when Shri Mataji asked some of the doctors, including you, to go and establish Sahaja Yoga in Russia. Is that right?

Dr. Nigam: Yes.

Interviewer: So you and another doctor stayed where in Russia?

Dr. Nigam: In Leningrad. No, no, in Moscow also. The photographs you are showing are from Moscow and Leningrad.

Interviewer: Let me bring out some photos. Let's start with the protocol that was signed, which is dated the 9th of August, 1989. This is a formal document signed by the Ministry of Health, USSR, and the Life Eternal Trust International to cooperate in the field of research of the Sahaja Yoga method in the USSR. A very nice document that you shared with us, Uncle.

Dr. Nigam: From the Indian side, Shri Mataji, Dr. Yogi Mahajan, Dr. Brian Wells, and Dr. Bogdan signed. And from their side, Professor Ilin signed.

Interviewer: Yes, the signature is here. V.I. Ilin, Main Administration, Ministry of Health, USSR. Okay, very nice. Here's a video of one of those public programs you're talking about. Is that right, Uncle?

Dr. Nigam: No, this is after the public program. They took the interview of Gregoire and mine and some part of Shri Mataji's speech, and they made it for their own purposes to spread Sahaja Yoga in Russia.

Interviewer: Such young children, all ages. It's a small stadium, actually, not a hall. There was an instance in Russia where Shri Mataji was saying there were so many people that the crowd outside was as large as the crowd inside.

Dr. Nigam: Yes, yes.

Interviewer: And where is this photo then?

Dr. Nigam: This is in the basement of Qutub Ashram when the award was given from the Academy of Science and Arts of St. Petersburg. Mr. Bornov came for it. You can see Rajesh Shah, Yogi Mahajan, and Nigel Powell from England is there.

Interviewer: This was in 1993, when the government of Russia awarded Shri Mataji?

Dr. Nigam: Yes, maybe 1993. This award was given by the Academy of Science and Arts of St. Petersburg, the same authority that gave the award to Einstein. And after Mother got this award, the local doctors said, "Einstein did his work on inanimate things, but Shri Mataji is doing her work on living beings. She is transforming living people." This was said by the doctors of Russia.

Interviewer: That's so amazing that although they were so new to Sahaja Yoga, they could still recognize it. And this photo? When and where is this?

Dr. Nigam: This is the embassy in Moscow. We were invited and we went there and gave the realization. Dr. Bogdan is there, I am there, and a local doctor is there. This was in 1989 or 1990.

Interviewer: And this is after Shri Mataji had given realization, everyone was just milling around.

Dr. Nigam: Yes, yes. It's really amazing. People were really strong. They had never seen her; they had never heard of any spirituality or religion. And they were just as if they knew Shri Mataji for ages. So much attraction. This was amazing for me.

Interviewer: You were stationed in Russia, moving from city to city giving programs with the other Sahaja Yogis. How were you in touch with Shri Mataji? It wasn't like now where we can use a mobile phone or WhatsApp. What was it like?

Dr. Nigam: I tell you, in Russia in 1990, if you wanted to talk to Shri Mataji in London, you had to book a call one day, and they would give you a time for two days later, saying, "At this time, you can come and talk to London."

Interviewer: This was also before the time of STD booths in India. It was all through the government exchange.

Dr. Nigam: Yes, no STD booths. And for your information, the air ticket from Moscow to Delhi was less than from Delhi to Bombay. A Delhi-Bombay-Delhi return ticket was 1500 rupees. The Moscow-Delhi-Moscow ticket was 1400 rupees. It's hard to believe, but it is true.

Interviewer: Amazing. How would you conduct the programs?

Dr. Nigam: I very well remember, immediately after our speech—mine or Bogdan's or anybody else's—as soon as the realization was given, the program would be over within a minute. A hundred people would line up on one side of the stage, and a hundred on the other side, standing very peacefully. I have never seen people so well organized, automatically, with no noise.

We only knew two words by that time: Nyet and da. Da means yes; nyet means no. The interpreter told the public, "When you feel cool vibrations, say da. If you don't, say nyet." That was all. We would ask a hundred people to open their hands, and they would all say, "Da, da, da." It was done (ho gaya). Such good vibrations. Hey, unbelievable. We could not believe ourselves how it was happening. That is why Shri Mataji used to say at that time, "You cannot believe." But I have experienced it myself. Unbelievable.

Interviewer: It's nice to talk in Hindi, which you are proficient in, but Russia is a different ballgame. How was your communication with the yogis there, and with Shri Mataji in London? Tell us some more details, please.

Dr. Nigam: Shri Mataji used to laugh when we would convey something. I remember one instance in particular. Professor Ilin rang us up and said, "Dr. Nigam, please come to our auditorium because from tomorrow we are going to have an international conference. If you need anything, please let us know so that we can organize it."

So, seven or eight of us went to the hall—three or four Russians and three or four doctors. The moment we reached there, there was a lady, a follower of Rajneesh, and she was shouting, "Why is it so? This is wrong, keep it here, throw it out!" She was just shouting and shouting. We kept waiting for about an hour as she carried on with her grudges. Finally, we told Professor Ilin, "We don't need anything. We just want to hang up the poster of Shri Mataji, and that is all." He said, "It's all right." So we said, "We'll be here tomorrow," and we came back.

On the way back to the flat, there was a young boy, around 15 or 16 years old, who had gotten his realization about 15 days back. He told me, "Uncle, why not shoebeat it?" Wow. None of us had even thought of this. This was a Russian boy who got his realization just 15 days back.

When we reached the flat, I told him to do the shoebeating, and he did it. Believe it, the program was for seven days, and this lady could not attend for even one hour. She was hospitalized that day.

This story was told to Shri Mataji, and she laughed and laughed. During this process, she said, "Are you people not coming for the puja?" And we had no idea. We didn't have money, we didn't have visas, nothing. But Shri Mataji organized everything.

We traveled without a ticket. We were abused by the police like anything because we had no ticket. This was on a train because we had to go from Rome to Montecatini.

Interviewer: You have shared this story with us before. But please repeat it briefly for listeners who may not have heard it.

Dr. Nigam: Alright. Shri Mataji asked, "Are you people not coming?" We never thought of going. I, being Indian, didn't have a visa for Italy, so there was no question. There were three of us: me, Bogdan, and Lev Navarov. Lev was a very smart person (chalu person, in Indian language). He knew Italian, Russian, and English, so he was useful for interpreting. He said, "Dr. Nigam, we should go. Mother has said we should go." I said, "I don't have the visa."

That same evening, we had a program at the Afghanistan Embassy in Moscow. We met a gentleman called Mr. Shivastav from the Indian Embassy. I requested him, "I want to go to Italy. Can you help?" He said he would talk to the Italian embassy staff and that I should go the next morning. So, we went, gave the passport, and he said, "Come at two o'clock and take it." We went at two o'clock, and he gave us the passport with the visa. Then he asked, "Give me the letter." I said, "Which letter?" He said, "Did Mr. Shivastav not give you any letter?" He hadn't. So he cancelled the visa because we did not have that letter.

Again, in the evening, I rang Mr. Shivastav. He said, "Yes, I had told him I'll give you a letter. Take the letter from my place tomorrow morning and go to the embassy." We took the letter and went to him, and he gave the visa. The puja was the next day at 11 o'clock. At 2 o'clock in Moscow, we got the visa and rushed towards the airport. We got the flight from Moscow to Rome, reached there around 6 o'clock, and immediately took a cab to the railway station, arriving at 9 o'clock.

It was rush hour. The moment we reached the station, a person was locking it up. I had never heard in my life that stations get locked (tala lagta hai). So he locked the station and went. Imagine, with such great difficulty we reached this place, and now we couldn't get a train. If we didn't get a train that night, we couldn't attend the puja.

But this Lev Navarov, he was very resourceful. He slipped inside here and there and saw a light on in one of the rooms. He went inside and asked the man that we had to go. The man said, "There is no possibility. You can take a train tomorrow morning." But then he called out, "Look, come here. There is a special train going for football lovers. If they stop here, you can take that." Luckily, the train stopped there, and we boarded without a ticket.

There was hardly any place to even stand. Most of the people were either drug addicts or full of alcohol. There were two groups shouting, and we were just standing by the door. Within a few minutes, three people who were sitting in a corner got up and went somewhere. Nobody came to take their seats. So this fellow says, "Let's go and sit." All three of us took that seat. Where there was no place to even stand, we got three seats.

Lev told us, "In case the ticket checker comes, you people will not speak a single word. You have to show that you are a full drug addict." I was very scared because I was holding an Indian passport. Within five minutes, the ticket checker came, asking, "Ticket please, ticket please." We acted as if we were drunk and sleeping. First, he was very polite. Then his volume raised and raised. Then he started abusing us. After some time, he went away. Lev told me he was using the worst abuses he had.

Anyway, we reached the next station in the morning, about 6:30. We were very hungry, and our clothes were dirty. We purchased a cup of coffee and a sandwich. In the meantime, the connecting train came, so we rushed towards it. We had Shri Mataji’s computer with us, and in the rush to catch the train, it was left at the canteen. Bogdan ran back and got it just as the train moved.

We were on the train, but we didn't know which Montecatini to get off at—there was a Montecatini T and a Montecatini P. We got off at the first one and took a cab to the address we had. The man there said, "Yes, the puja was here, but the number of people increased, so they have changed the venue." He didn't know where the new place was.

We came out, knowing nothing about where to go. We were just walking when a minibus-type car came and stopped beside us. The driver asked, "Are you Sahaja Yogis?" He saw the badge of Shri Mataji we were wearing. He said he was also looking for the puja. We sat in his car and were driving around when we saw two ladies wearing sarees. We reached the venue. It was around 11 o'clock, the time the puja was supposed to start.

The moment we climbed the steps, we saw Shri Mataji coming from the other side. The words she used were, "Achcha. So, you all came." (Oh. So, you all came.) Imagine, that is what she said. We were so happy to see her. She said, "So, let's go and sit in the puja." I said, "Shri Mataji, we haven't even washed. We are all dirty. We are hungry and thirsty." She said, "You people don't have anything to eat or drink? Go and have something." If the desire is there, you see, she organized everything.

Interviewer: After the puja, you went back to Russia. Tell us some of your conversations with Shri Mataji, perhaps in Hindi as well.

Dr. Nigam: A flight from Moscow to Leningrad cost one and a half dollars. Can you believe it? That is how we used to travel by flight almost every day. The five-star hotel we stayed in also cost one and a half dollars per night. We always stayed in the best hotels because it was so cheap. At that time, one dollar cost 17 or maybe 26 Indian rupees.

Interviewer: Tell us about some miracles you experienced there.

Dr. Nigam: Because of the Chernobyl atomic accident, hundreds of people would come—children, elderly people—with a pump here, something swollen there. And most of them were cured. That is how it went like a wildfire.

Another time, a doctor came and told Shri Mataji, "We want to spread Sahaja Yoga scientifically. I will take your photograph via satellite, and from there, the vibrations will come through." Mother was very happy. He was a very big authority.

There are so many memories. Oleg Kutinsky, who became one of the leaders, came to my house in Delhi for lunch with other yogis. He took a book from my bookshelf—it was the Jnaneshwari—and he started reading. He was not ready to eat food. He said, "No, no, I'm reading this. It's very important." He was taking in the Jnaneshwari, not the food.

There is one small story. There were eight of them, and we had two cars. We were taking them through a middle-class market in Delhi. There was a fruit market, half a mile this way and half a mile that way, with thousands of fruit sellers. The moment these Russians saw them, they immediately said, "Please, stop the car here!" They had never seen so many fruits at one place. They took photographs.

Later, my wife Renu was very curious and asked what they would like as a present. When we forced them, a lady said, "Give me one ananas." A pineapple. So we gave them two each. Renu asked them, "Why are you so particular about this?" They said, "You don't know. We will take them and put them on the dining table for a week or so, just to let everybody see that we have got a pineapple." It was amazing.

Interviewer: Was there any problem getting Indian food?

Dr. Nigam: I went to a hotel and asked for some omelette or boiled eggs. The lady didn't know what an omelette or an egg was. So, after a couple of months, I came to India and learned from Renu how to make tea and cook vegetables. Vegetables were not available there, so I took about five kgs of rajma (kidney beans) back with me.

On the very first day I reached there, I said, "Let me make the curry." I prepared about one kg of rajma, thinking I would make it and keep eating it. But when I was cooking, everybody came, "Dr. Nigam, you are cooking something?" I said, "This is rajma." When I finished, they asked, "Can I taste it?" I said, "Why not?" Well, that one kg of rajma was finished just in the tasting. That was the condition. But we thoroughly enjoyed the love and affection they gave.

Once, we went from India to Russia with Shri Mataji—me, Yogi Mahajan, and Shri Mataji. We reached Moscow. In those days, the visa was given on leaflets; it was not stamped on the passport. The man at immigration asked Shri Mataji, "Please give me your visa." She said, "It must be in the passport." It wasn't there. I got scared; they were very strict about it. Then the man asked Shri Mataji, "How many days do you want?" Mother asked me, so I said, "Three days, Shri Mataji." She said, "Three days."

That boy looked at Shri Mataji, and I remember Shri Mataji looked at that boy. She didn't speak aloud, but her lips moved. She said something not audible. And he took out a slip and wrote on it: "Permitted for four days." So, she went without a visa. Amazing.

Interviewer: Thank you so much for joining us, uncle. It was lovely talking to you and hearing how Shri Mataji worked. I'm sorry you couldn't open all the photographs. Maybe some other time.

Dr. Nigam: Yes, yes, sure.

Interviewer: Thank you so much for joining us. Lots of love from all of us. And thanks to Shri Mataji for giving us these beautiful moments to recollect of the times in Russia with you and all the other Sahaja Yogis. These are such precious memories. Thank you so much for sharing with us.

Dr. Nigam: Give my love to Shankar also.

Interviewer: Will do, uncle. Thank you very much. Jai Shri Mataji.

Dr. Nigam: When you record it, please send a copy.
