One story, I suppose, shows how much care Mother gives and also how miraculous the things she does are. My wife was expecting our second child, and we had a seminar at Cowley Manor. They gave her the bedroom next to Shri Mataji's because she was expecting. The next morning after arriving, she had just come out of her room, and the door to Shri Mataji's room was open. Shri Mataji asked whoever was with Her, "Who is that outside?" And She described my wife physically—i.e., very much expecting. She was about eight months pregnant.

Rosie happened to be there as well, and Mother said, "Oh, is it Rosie?"

My wife called out, saying, "No, Rosie is in Australia. Her daughter, Sukanya, got married in America a year or two ago, I think." And she said, "No, Mother, it's Maureen."

She called her in and worked on her Swadisthan for 40 minutes. She said, "This will help your delivery." Well, our son, Innocent, was born in 40 minutes. So, even to that degree, She looks after us. I don't know what more I could say.

You haven't talked about your marriage.

Oh, haven't I? I don't mean it like that—I just thought you wanted this to be quick. Not that it's a long story, but I can say that, I suppose.

Basically, Shri Mataji asked me if I'd marry Gretchen just after I'd gotten to know her. I had thought how nice it was to meet a yogini that I felt was just like my sister. And I thought, "Oh, gosh... I don't really feel like she's someone I'd want to marry." So anyway, I went into meditation. I felt my right heart get really cool and felt the presence of Mahakali on my left side. And so I said, "Yes, okay."

Unsurprisingly. But then the message came back from Shri Mataji: "You didn't say yes spontaneously enough." And so She kept me waiting for a week until She finally said, "Okay, you can marry her."

But then the next problem was that she was married to somebody else from the past. She had a strange marriage with a friend of a friend from West Germany so she could escape from Poland, because at the time they couldn't leave. So they'd had this marriage. She'd immediately gone to West Berlin, then straight to London, and had stayed there ever since. But her passport was only valid for three months—that's all they'd give her—so it ran out. She was an illegal alien, and we had to somehow get past all these barriers.

Somehow, she managed to get through the court divorce without them discovering she wasn't supposed to be in the country. Her husband had disappeared in Kathmandu, and we had to send word to the embassy there that this marriage was going to be dissolved and everything. Then we had to go to the registrar and somehow get married without her having any valid papers. I looked at all these different, complicated ways of doing it, and in the end, I thought, "Well, I'll just put a bandhan and hope for the best."

So we just went there. The officials there—they're not really immigration officials, but they act like it. Anyway, he went through the whole passport, wrote down all the numbers of the stamps and everything, and didn't notice it was 18 months out of date. It was amazing. And then at the end of it, he obviously felt something was wrong and he couldn't quite put his finger on it. He did it all over again and he still didn't notice. So we got out. We got married. I put in for a special license and got it as soon as possible.

My parents came to the ceremony. Once they'd finished, they said, "You know, normally the wife and the couple like to be seen signing the register here." I looked around and Gretchen was jumping up and down on the chair, waving the certificate above her head. And I said, "For God's sake, let's get out of here!" My parents were saying, "What's going on? What's going on?" We escaped and we were all right.

We had our Sahaj marriage at Chelsham Road. In fact, ours was the first wedding there. We were working on the building all day. In the evening, they just put plastic and bits of wood across everything, hung a few balloons around, and had a fire. We had a proper marriage. I didn't have my glasses on, so I was afraid I was going to fall in the fire. Gretchen sulked all the way through because she didn't think her veil matched her sari.

We had our first argument on the way back afterwards. I had no money, and we had nowhere to go. So we went to Douglas' place; he said we could go and stay there. Someone lent me a van, which ran out of petrol in Baker Street at eleven o'clock at night. We had our argument because I refused to get out of the car still wearing my turban.

Then what happened was, we got a taxi. Gretchen kept her veil down, and she got in. The driver drove off with her! I was chasing them down the road because he thought she was going off with him. Eventually, we got back, and I went and picked up the van the next morning. So, that was that.
