[Long introduction in English and Tai]

Pascal: So ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this evening. So tonight, we have the honour and the pleasure to introduce you to an exceptional lady for an exceptional evening. So, Shri Mataji will come in about 40 minutes. But before that, before she comes, we would like to tell you a little more about her, and especially about the techniques that she has been developing these last 20 years or more. So when I say that Shri Mataji is an exceptional lady, I have to mention a few facts about her life. And the first thing I want to say is that Shri Mataji is now 73 years old. But two weeks ago she was in Australia. And then she went to Hong Kong, then to Taiwan, then to Malaysia, now she is in Bangkok. And tomorrow, in two days, she will be in India. Oh, sorry, maybe a little bit long for the Mei to translate.

So, I have also to mention that Shri Mataji has a family. She has children, grandchildren. She is married. And she is from a very high family. But still at this age, she travels all around the world, so why? When I say that Shri Mataji comes from a very high family, I mean to say that, for example, the husband of Shri Mataji was the United Nations Director or General Secretary for Maritime Affairs during more than 15 years in London.

And of course, whenever Shri Mataji travels around the world like this, she is not paid for this conference. And she will not take any money from you or from me for this conference. She comes because she has a message to give us. And so she comes because she has a message to give us. And this message is a very simple message, but at the same time absolutely fantastic. And this message, actually, is an experience, the experience of yoga.
So, Kundalini is already translated in Thai, but yoga actually, means to be in union with something. So in union with what? With the inner-self, but also with the energy and whatever is around us. So yoga is not something that you can do, you don't practice yoga, but you can be in a state of yoga.

So some people when they phone us, they just say, oh, should I come and go jogging and basket? Or you know, they just ask what kind of exercise we have. But as I told you, we don't do yoga. We are in this state or not. And Shri Mataji would like you, or this evening, to start experiencing this state of yoga. And also some people ask us, is it a religion? Is it Buddhist? Is it Hinduist? Or what? But actually in India, there is a saying that, "Saints have no religion, they are above religions". So, actually, when I say that saints are above religions, it means that when you experience a certain state of union with your Self, this is the same thing that is described in all the religions, all the spiritual techniques or traditions, we can say.

So tonight, we will not speak about religion or we just speak about something which is a state of well-being that you can experience. So just imagine that you have an energy within that starts to be awakened and this energy makes you conscious of your emotional state, physical state, in a much more accurate way than you could ever imagine. Just imagine that this silent energy that also tells you about all the people, how they are inside. And also imagine that this energy can cure you but can also cure others.
So, to be more clear, I will just show you this map behind. And you see, on this map, you have three channels inside the body of the gentleman which is sitting in yoga. And in his body, we have one channel on the left, which is, according to people who practice in yoga, the energy by which you feel things, by which you have the emotions. This is linked to the past. And you have another energy on the right side which is linked to the future, to your energy of planning. We can see the energy of the brain being futuristic, you see, this kind of person who plan their lives, "Tomorrow I have to do this. In ten years, I have to do this".

So, we can say that I am not talking about the middle channel of the body of the gentleman, but we can say that you have two kinds of energy in human beings and Asian people know that very well. This is the yin and the yang. This is the female energy, the male energy, the past, the future, and the emotion, the action. So actually, we are just living with these two energies and this is very difficult to be in the present. Because if you are in the present, means you are not thinking about the future, thinking about the past, you are just there, in reality. And this, if you try to see within yourself, this is very difficult. Because it means also that you have to be above your mental activity.

So, actually, we live in a world which is relative, we can say. And let's say somebody is more on the right side. Let's say that this gentleman here, use more his energy on the right side. What does it mean? It means that in his life, in his everyday life, he will be more, you know, this kind of person which are very active, very logical. In everything they do, they are very logical. And with this, we can say this energy of planning and they are very active with their brain, but maybe they don't have feelings anymore.

So if you are too much on the right side, you will be this kind of person who, after his job, sitting in the car, once he has left the office, he is thinking about tomorrow, "What I have to do, I have to do this meeting, I have to write this note, I have to start this project". It means that you are not in the present, but you are already in your worries about tomorrow, what you have to do in the next week and the next month. And of course, when it is time to sleep, you cannot sleep, because you are still thinking about your job. So this is, we can say, of course this is a gross picture, but we can see that people who are more on the right side, the right-side energy tends to be like this.

So these people suffer. But they also may not be able to suffer, because when we are too much on the right side, using too much of our brain and we don’t use our heart to feel what other people are, how they are, how they react. So we just like to, and we start to see only ourselves, we are more than ego here, this big little balloon here. So of course, you can imagine, you have also people on the left side, and these people are people who just live with their heart. They have emotions. So this is very nice, but sometimes you can be also dominated by your emotions.

So of course, if you go too much on the right side, or too much on the left side, I mean, too much on your action, on your brain, too much active, or either if you have too much on your emotions, too much thinking about the past, lethargic, then some disorders that happen and you can get sick, physically or mentally. So of course, the best would be to be more on the middle channel, and this is what the Buddhist people know that. We also know it in India, but it's very difficult to achieve. This is what everybody is trying to seek in meditation, trying to achieve, to be more in the present, not to go on the extremes. Because when you are, let's say, you are not sitting here tonight, nobody, no one of us should have any problem. Because what problem is there tonight? We are just sitting in a nice hall. So we shouldn't have any worries or any problem, because we are in the present. I mean if we can be in the present, then there is no problem.

So of course, all this is just a talk. But what happens in Sahaja Yoga is that you have an energy in your body, here, which is named in Sanskrit as Kundalini. And this is a sacred energy. And when this energy rises, then you are above the right side and the left side, we can say. You can enter into the present very easily. And when this energy rises, then you also start to feel a deep feeling of peace and of compassion for others, but also for yourself. Because some people, whatever they do, they don't like themselves. But in Sahaja Yoga, you start loving others, you start loving yourself and be in peace. You become a peaceful person, very easily. And this is not a mental process. You will start to feel it. You will start to feel that this energy is raising into your body. And you might also feel, most of you will feel it on your hands here and on top of your head. You will start to feel like a cool wind, cool breeze coming in your head and on top of your head.

And this is not a new thing. This is not a new knowledge. We will show you some slides later on. And you will see that on many stages, like many stages of the Buddha, there was this knowledge before. The only thing is that, as this stage is very difficult to achieve, people now, they don't understand all these symbols that you can see on the stages of Lord Buddha. So, tonight we’ll not become Buddhas and no one here is a Buddha. But what you will start to experience is that, the same energy that raised into Lord Buddha when he got his enlightenment, starts to rise in you. Of course very slowly, not at the same level.

So, all this seems maybe a little bit mysterious to you, but one thing which is very important is that don't believe me, don't believe Mehei, and don't believe in Shri Mataji when she comes. So, you don't have to believe, but you will try and you will see by yourself. Maybe it will work at first, I would say, for most of you. But still you will need maybe one month, two months more of practice to really feel everything inside you, to feel this energy working inside you. So, what does it mean? It means that one energy will start to raise inside you, and then you will feel different things in your body. You start to feel, "Oh, maybe I am too much on the right side", means, "I am more dominated by my actions". And you will feel it physically, because you will feel that your right hand, which is linked with the right channel, will be hot, more hot.

Or let's say that, if you are someone who is not so self-confident, when this energy will rise, she will stop here, on the heart center. And you will feel a kind of pressure here, or maybe a kind of heat, very slight, of course, it's not hurting. And maybe in your hands also, on this finger, on this little finger, because this is linked with this chakra. So you will feel it, but also you can start to clear that inside you. It means that, basically, for someone who will feel this heart problem, this insecurity problem, just by giving energy, this inner energy that you have already inside you, by directing it to this center, you will feel much more confident and much more peaceful.

And these chakras are linked with your emotions, but also with your bodies, I mean whatever. Let's say somebody is sick, had a heart problem, heart attack maybe, a few years before. But if he comes to Sahaja Yoga, he will feel that the energy will stop here, because this energy has to cure it, has to balance it. And you can feel it in others also. If, at your job, you meet somebody who is really a bit worried about one project or angry with you, you will feel it on yourself, on your head, you will just feel there is a pressure here, on this center, on this Agnya Chakra. That's what we call it. You will feel it directly, you don't need to speak to that person, you know that there is a problem.

And of course, when this energy rises, she will have to open all these chakras and each chakra has a specific quality. So it means that basically all the qualities which are inside you, but maybe not manifested yet, start to manifest themselves much more. But I will not go much more into details. It is just for you to know that, I mean, now basically, Shri Mataji is going to speak about it tonight and about what you can achieve through Sahaja Yoga. But the most important thing is that you will have to try by yourself. And it is also absolutely essential to know that you cannot pay to learn this kind of knowledge. You cannot pay for this event to happen inside you.

So, I would like to say a few more words about Shri Mataji, who she is. So as I told you, Shri Mataji is Indian, it's an Indian lady. And Shri Mataji was born in a royal family in India. And now she is about 73 years old. She was born in a Christian family. This is something important. And in her childhood, her parents were very much involved in the independence fight, the fight for independence of India. And Shri Mataji, even as a child, was regularly in the ashram of Mahatma Gandhi. And it is said that the Mahatma Gandhi had recognized her as a very special child, and would ask her about meditation. And as a young girl, Shri Mataji was one of the leaders of the independence movement of India for the young people. And then Shri Mataji studied medicine. Then she had a very normal life, in the sense that she married an Indian gentleman who later had this high career that I told you about. And it's important to say that Shri Mataji was born with this energy completely awakened inside her. But as many saints, she couldn't, at that moment, give or transmit this experience to other people like you and me who are not ready for that.

And in 1970, somehow, because it was the moment, and also because Shri Mataji felt that there were so many seekers, of truth, of peace, of spirituality who were misguided by so many gurus, she somehow in her meditation found a way to give this experience to other people. And that's the way Sahaja Yoga started in 1970. And now Sahaja Yoga is practiced in more than a hundred countries. And Shri Mataji received the United Nations Peace price in 1989 as a recognition for her work in Sahaja Yoga. And she has been invited officially by so many countries, by so many cities. And when you go out, maybe if you have time you will just look on the table at the entrance, you will see all the [unclear] and some, not all, some of these [unclear] and some of these invitations of officials for Shri Mataji to present her great work of Sahaja Yoga. And also it's important to know that Sahaja Yoga maybe is not so famous as some other movements, because we don't take money. So we cannot advertise as much as some people do, maybe take a lot of money to teach spirituality or to teach yoga or whatever. It's something that people practice Sahaja Yoga for quite a long time when they feel that really it's helping them and they want to help others. And of course we joined together and we managed to rent this hotel, for example, to rent this hall with the help of this hotel, like Pramlant Hotel gave us some very special prize because they know that we try to do something for others, not for us, not for me, not for Kundalini, not for any of the Sahaja Yogis and certainly not for Shri Mataji.

So we would like you to really try to see by yourself tonight what's happening inside you. And please, we would like to ask you to take a bit of time also. This is not a very easy process, but this is a natural process. And the tree doesn't grow into one night. It takes at least a few months before you see something growing out of the earth and then it takes years before it's a very solid and total tree. And especially, please remember that you don't have anything to lose in that. So people were just informing me that Shri Mataji had a kind of interview or something like this. So she will come in maybe 10 minutes. But before that, what then we can do is that I would like to show you some slides. And on these slides what you will see is that this energy I have been speaking about sometimes can be seen on pictures.

So some technical problems. Very normal. Nothing so special. Shri Mataji is here, sitting there. But this picture, we can see all kind of rays of light coming out of Shri Mataji. This was one of the same. This is, again, there was no light actually here. It was just a temple in India. And when we took this picture, it was only the light of Shri Mataji. I think Shri Mataji was speaking to people and then she just stopped, put her hands like this and she just started to smile. And we took the picture and this happened. And then she explained that there was some saint living in this temple, a long time ago, and somehow it was his energy that we could feel, that she could feel at that moment. And that comes as a light here. So of course, don't believe that. But you will start to see by yourself. And this picture is interesting. Sorry maybe for those people who are too far, it's not easy to see, but here you many people sitting, normally and they are all Sahaja Yogis practicing Sahaja Yoga. And on top of their head, you have this kind of light. On all of them. And this again is the same kind of thing. Just some Sahaja Yogis standing and all these lights coming on top of their head.

Now Shri Mataji is arriving.
[Applause]
Thank you.

To welcome Shri Mataji, we’ll have an introductory speech of Dr. Su Tin who is Deputy, who is member of the Parliament. He would like to introduce Shri Mataji.
[Applause]

[Dr Su Tin speaks in Tai for 12 minutes]

[Applause]

Pascal: I would just say in few words what Dr. Suttin just said. I think Dr. Suttin explained to us how last year he had the opportunity to welcome Shri Mataji as a VIP in the empire and how he was just overwhelmed by the motherliness love of Shri Mataji and her capacity to give joy and peace inside everybody who is approaching her. And Dr. Suttin also related an event that happened this evening, which is that she was even at the meeting with the head of the Thai Parliament, the president of the Thai Parliament. And the meeting was supposed to take only 15 minutes, but actually in the first 10 or 15 minutes, Shri Mataji explained about Sahaja Yoga and she gave this experience to Thangul Hoe, the president of the Thai Parliament and his assistant. And then the meeting was for more than one hour, because they were so interested and so overwhelmed by this peace and this joy, that they started to feel in their heart after the awakening of this energy. And also Dr. Suttin just encouraged all of us to try to discover this very extraordinary way to attain the peace inside, that is free and that is for everybody and without any concern for the world, for the age, for the nationality, the religion. And Dr. Suttin also mentioned about Shri Mataji, how she got the United Nations Peace Medal in 1989, how she is a member of the Academy of Science of St. Peterburg’s College, honorary member, and also how she got the doctorate in cognitive science from the University of Bucharest in Romania and how she has been invited by the government of Tunisia to present Sahaja Yoga, how she has been invited by so many countries, so many cities like Vancouver, like Sydney, like Brasilia. Some of these places, they even say that, they proclaimed the day of the coming of Shri Mataji in their city, like the official Shri Mataji Day, and also how Shri Mataji was the official speaker for the Fourth Women's International Conference in Beijing last year. Thank you very much Dr. Su Tin.

[TALK starts at 1:06:30]

Shri Mataji: I bow to all the seekers of truth. When we talk of truth, we have to know what are we seeking. The truth is, has been, and will be. It cannot be described; it cannot be transformed or changed. Whatever I am saying to you, you should not take it for granted.

We have had lots of trouble with blind faith. But if you experience what I am saying, then it would be better that we accept it as honest people. It is for your benevolence, for the benevolence of your family, for the benevolence of your country, and for the benevolence of the whole world.
You have been already told about the subtle system we have within ourselves. In this, there is a power, in the triangular bone, known as ‘sacrum’, that means the Greek knew that it was a sacred bone. This power is coiled in three and a half coils. And coils in Sanskrit means ‘kundal’ and she- it is a feminine power that she is called as Kundalini. When she is awakened, it's a living process of evolution. It is your own power. She is your own individual. She knows everything about you. She knows about your past. She knows about your aspirations. And she is anxious to give you your second birth.

All the scriptures have described that you are to be born again or you have to know yourself. Even in Koran, Muhammad Sahib has said, "Unless and until you know yourself, you cannot know God". So the first truth is that you are not this body, this mind, this ego, these conditionings, these emotions, but you are the pure Spirit. The second truth is that there is an All-pervading divine Power which does all the human work.

You see all these beautiful flowers, beautiful trees, so much living work has been done, who does this? If you ask a doctor, "Who runs my heart?" So he will say, "It's autonomous nervous system". But if you say, "Who is this auto?" He won't be able to say who is that. Also, science has its own limitations. Firstly, it is amoral. I mean, you can make something nice for living. Also, you can make atom bombs to kill so many. There are many limitations of science. It cannot answer the question, "Why are we on this earth?" With us, the problem is, "Why we don't have peace and why we are so much tortured in these modern times?"

We do not know the absolute truth. We live in a relative world. Also, this mind that we have is a myth. We have ourselves created it by our conditionings and by our ego. As we react with these two ‘ballons’ within us, this mind is created, like, we can say, bubbles. And the bubbles of thoughts keep us out of reality. Speciality of human beings is they react to everything. And thus this mind is created. All wars, all ugly things, all horrible things, all these are created by human mind. But if you know the absolute truth, there will be no quarrelling, no fighting, no arguments, nothing. So what is the absolute truth is this, that you are the pure Spirit, that there is an All-pervading power of divine love and thirdly, that you are a part and parcel of the whole. You belong to one organism or you can call it, one personality.

Actually, no religion is exclusive. For example, Abraham, Moses, were all described by Christ. Especially, Muhammad Sahib described Christ and his Mother in a very respectful manner, more than, you’ll be amazed, in the Bible. She is described in a very honourable way by Muhammad Sahib. So, how can Muslims, Christians, Hindus, fight? All these religions were born on the same tree of spirituality as beautiful flowers. And we have plucked them and now fight with dead flowers. But who follows the religion? Only when this Kundalini rises, she enlightens the religion within. You actually become religious, innately. I don't have to tell you, "Don’t do this, don't do that". You yourself know what is to be done. That means you yourself become a saint. Once you are enlightened in the light of the Spirit, you give up whatever is destructive.

Many people say, "How to give up drugs? How to fight these habits?" In the light of the Spirit, they give up, overnight, all these bad habits, I’ve seen, overnight. At least, thirty percent of the Sahaja Yogis were drug addicts. They gave up drugs, alcoholism, all kinds of bad habits they gave up, without any trouble. Because you do not have inner strength to give up. But in the light of the Spirit, you become so confident, and you just drop off all these bad habits.

This is not only that happens to you. If you see your life, you are always bombarded by the thoughts of the past and the future. But you cannot be in the present. You cannot be in the present: the thoughts come to you from the past or the future. And you jump on the curst of these thoughts all the time. You never can be in the present which is the reality. Because past is finished, future doesn't exist. So when this Kundalini rises, she elongates these thoughts and there is a space created in you, in your attention. And she will go beyond your mind. At that stage, you become a witness, you watch everything. You watch, you enjoy everything. You do not react. If it is something ridiculous, still you know it is ridiculous. But you don’t react. The whole thing looks like a drama.

Like if you are in the water and lots of waves are coming in the sea, you are frightened of those waves. But supposing by some chance, you get into a boat, you can watch all these waves and enjoy. But supposing you know how to swim, you can jump and make many people come in the boat. You cross your mind, as a result you become thoughtlessly aware. You are aware, fully aware, but you are thoughtless. That is how you become peaceful. That is how you become balanced. That is how you become very compassionate. That is how you become very dynamic.

I am very old, as you know, and I travel so much. So they ask Me, "Now, don’t you feel the travelling? " I tell them, "I don't think I am travelling. Thinking about it is tiring. But if you don’t think you are travelling, it’s perfect". All these tensions of travelling, of stress and strain and all that, just disappears. Another state that you reach, we can call a new dimension into your awareness is that you become collectively conscious. As I told you, you become part and parcel of the whole. Sitting down here, you can feel the vibrations, the Divine vibrations of another person, and make out also who is that person. The centres, about which you were told, are responsible for our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being. So when this Kundalini rises, she integrates those centres. Also, she nourishes them, and connects them to the All-pervading Power.

So with this power, your health gets all right, your health problems are solved. Through Sahaja Yoga, we have cured many incurable diseases. I need not say ‘we’, but we should say, "Your own power has cured it". We have now a curative center in India, where you all can come, and get yourself cured if you have time. Then mentally, many people have been cured who have mental problems like schizophrenia, lunacy, depression, and all that. Many diseases which are psychosomatic are also cured. Your emotional problems are solved.

This is a vast breakthrough of your evolution. This All-pervading Power is the ocean of knowledge. Knowledge which is true. You can feel it on your fingertips, the knowledge about anyone. Also about yourself and also others, because you belong collectively conscious. Now if you can cure yourself, you can cure others also. You can raise the Kundalini of others also.

I have not been to all these countries, where Sahaja Yoga is working, it's more than 100, they say so. Only somebody went to my program, somewhere, and went back, and started Sahaja Yoga. Like one candle which is enlightened, can enlighten you, can enlighten many lights. Your attention also becomes very concentrated and deep. If you could motivate your attention to any particular situation, or to any particular person, or any problem, it gets solved. Because this All-pervading Power of divine love does everything for you. It is the ocean of bliss some may even taste it. But you don't know what you are, how much you are fantastic. You don't know how glorious you are. All this is only possible if this Kundalini can be awakened.

Above all, what happens, that you jump into the sea of joy. Joy is singular: it is not a happiness or unhappiness. When our ego is pampered, we feel happy, when it is punctured, we feel unhappy. Joy is something that you have to experience. Of course, you see, it is not meant for stupid people or very arrogant, egoistical. I've seen people who could never come on the stage, have now become great orators, somehow become great musicians, poets, through this happening. You understand another person so clearly, everything so clearly, that you can handle the situation much better.

You are becoming a very satisfied soul. You know the laws of economics satiety, that wants are not satiable in general. Today you want a house and a car, then a helicopter, I don’t know how it goes on like that. We work very hard to achieve all that. And once we get it, the joy is lost [unclear]. Then we’ll want something more, another, it goes on like that. But if you get into the state of thoughtless awareness, you enjoy everything in such a beautiful way. Now I see a very nice carpet. I just watch. I just see it. But if it was not for my Self-realisation, I would have been worried, "Oh, my goodness! This thing is mine. I have not assured it".
[Shri Mataji laughs gently]
If it belongs to somebody else, I would have been worried how to get it, from where to get it, how much it will cost, all kinds of clutches. But when I am watching it, just watching it, without any then, what happens, that the joy that the artist has put in it starts flowing just like cool and cool current on Me.

We have also become, say, slave of many things we have [unclear], like computer. Now we are slaves of computer. But you know there is a divine computer within us. When it becomes active, you know everything. We are slave of watch and we are worried about the time. Especially Bangkok has such a lot of traffic jams, that you don’t know how to reach in time anywhere.
[Laughter]
But if you are connected with the Divine, then you surf upon time [unsure]. You go beyond time. And exactly at the right time everything happens for you. We are saving, time, saving time, for what? For wasting only? We save time for our ascent to meditate and grow.

All this is within you in a potential state. In this short time, of course, I cannot tell you all about it. Only thing I can say, it will take about ten minutes for you to get your Self-realisation. So fast! Of course, you cannot pay for it. It is a living process. Like a seed: you can put it in the Mother Earth, it sprouts nicely. How much do we pay to this Mother Earth? This happens because the seed has the power to sprout, and this Mother Earth has got the power to sprout it. It is all built in. It is all built in within you. There is one thing I must tell you: it is like sprouting a seed, to begin with. But then it has to grow into a tree.

So far, I don’t know why, we have seen that in this country, people don’t understand it very deeply, many do not understand. Maybe those whom we have met, out of them, they came to my lecture, it’s all right, they got their Realisation all right, but they didn’t grow much. So, what is the use of having these sprouted seeds, as Christ has described, who felt the mash? This is the most important thing that should happen to you. And you must understand your own importance of your identity. And you must respect your Realisation. We have some very good Sahaja Yogis here, who are very good and who can help you to grow. And we have centres that will help you to grow. You don’t have to pay for it. Again! Actually, you have to love yourself, and know that you are something great -otherwise, it would be like guru shopping always- that you become powerful enough that you can give Realisation to others. You are all capable of doing it.

So many have come from other countries here. But now I request you that you grow so much that you can go to other countries and help them. Your compassion will help them. Your compassion itself should help. Recently, some Sahaja Yogis, German Sahaja Yogis, went to Israel. I asked them, "Why did you go to Israel of all the places?" They said, "Mother, don't you think our forefathers have killed so many Jews, we have to do something about it?" All this ocean of compassion is within you. All this beautiful lake of peace is within you. And the ocean of joy that has awakened you, is within you. I hope you’ll pay attention to your Self and get established in Sahaja Yoga.

All right. Now another thing is that I cannot force it on anyone. It cannot be forced. You have to ask for it from your heart. This Kundalini is the power of pure desire. If you don’t have desire, I cannot force you. Get your Self-realisation is not difficult. You all are ready for it. All are ready for it! Only thing is, you should not feel guilty about yourself or anything whatsoever. Whatever has happened in the past, just forget it. What is important is present. If you feel guilty too much, then you might develop a problem on this side, on the left side of the Vishudhi chakra. That can give you some spondylitis, that can give you angina, can give you lethargic organs. So, what is the use of feeling guilty? If somebody judges you, "You are a sinner". Don’t bother about such people. So please, forgive yourself completely.

The second thing is that you have to forgive everyone. Logically, whether you forgive or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything. What do you do? But if you don’t forgive, then you play into wrong hands, and torture yourself for nothing at all. So, you have to forgive in general you don’t have to think of those people who are torturing you. Just say in your heart that, "I forgive everyone" in general. You will feel very, very light.

As I told you, I cannot force it on you. Those who do not want to have Self-realisation can leave the hall. Please, leave the hall. I told you it will hardly take ten minutes only. Another-forgot to precise- is to take out your shoes, I hope you don’t mind. I asked, first time in England, for people to take out their shoes and they walked out.

I promise, all of you will get Realisation. But don’t doubt yourself. Have confidence [unclear]. These are special times. I call them Blossom Time where many flowers are going to become fruits.

[Realisation process starts]

Now a simple thing you have to do, is to put both the hands towards Me like this. These are all sympathetic endings, five, six and seven. Later on, you can find out why we regard this. But just now, just put your hands like this.
Now put your right hand towards Me and put your left hand on top of the fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone in your childhood. In Sanskrit, we call it "talu bhaag", "talu". Those who are sitting on a chair, please put both the feet apart from each other.
Now see if there is any cool or hot breeze like vibrations are coming from your own head..
[Unclear] put your hand on top of your head in the sense that you keep it away from it.
Now some people get it higher, some lower, so move your hand and see for yourself. If it is hot, that means that you have not forgiven yourself or others.
Now please put your right hand on top of your head, and left hand towards Me like this. And bend your head again and see for yourself if there is hot or cool breeze like vibrations coming out of your own head. Now don’t doubt it, don’t think it is air-conditioning. It is from your head [that] it is coming.
Now the last try. Again put your hand towards Me and see with the left hand if there is a cool...

Now please raise both your hands toward the sky and stretch back your neck, and ask one of these questions, three times, in your heart - you can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji, whatever you like. Ask a question, "Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy ghost?" Or, second question, you can ask three times, "Is this the All-pervading Power of divine love that is 'Ruh'?" Or, "Is this the Param Chaitanya, the Brahma Chaitanya?"

Now please take down your hands and put both the hands towards Me.

All those who have felt cool breeze on fingertips or on the palm or out of their fontanel bone area from the head, or hot breeze, please raise both your hands.
Look at that. I bow to you all. Your saintly life has started. Now grow into it. I all request you to grow into it.
Our centres are humble, we don't take any money. But you should not feel degraded by going there in any way. Again I bow to you for achieving the saintliness with you. May God bless you. For which you don't have to give up anything. You don't have to fast. You don't have to [unclear]. Nothing has to be done.
May God bless you all.
May God bless you all.

[Applause while Shri Mataji is leaving]
