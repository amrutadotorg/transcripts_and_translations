[Long introduction in English and Tai]
Pascal: So ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this evening. So tonight, we have the honour and the pleasure to introduce you to an exceptional lady for an exceptional evening. So, Shri Mataji will come in about 40 minutes. But before that, before she comes, we would like to tell you a little more about her, and especially about the techniques that she has been developing these last 20 years or more. So when I say that Shri Mataji is an exceptional lady, I have to mention a few facts about her life. And the first thing I want to say is that Shri Mataji is now 73 years old. But two weeks ago she was in Australia. And then she went to Hong Kong, then to Taiwan, then to Malaysia, now she is in Bangkok. And tomorrow, in two days, she will be in India. Oh, sorry, maybe a little bit long for the Mei to translate.

So, I have also to mention that Shri Mataji has a family. She has children, grandchildren. She is married. And she is from a very high family. But still at this age, she travels all around the world, so why? When I say that Shri Mataji comes from a very high family, I mean to say that, for example, the husband of Shri Mataji was the United Nations Director or General Secretary for Maritime Affairs during more than 15 years in London.

And of course, whenever Shri Mataji travels around the world like this, she is not paid for this conference. And she will not take any money from you or from me for this conference. She comes because she has a message to give us. And so she comes because she has a message to give us. And this message is a very simple message, but at the same time absolutely fantastic. And this message, actually, is an experience, the experience of yoga.
So, Kundalini is already translated in Thai, but yoga actually, means to be in union with something. So in union with what? With the inner-self, but also with the energy and whatever is around us. So yoga is not something that you can do, you don't practice yoga, but you can be in a state of yoga.

So some people when they phone us, they just say, oh, should I come and go jogging and basket? Or you know, they just ask what kind of exercise we have. But as I told you, we don't do yoga. We are in this state or not. And Shri Mataji would like you, or this evening, to start experiencing this state of yoga. And also some people ask us, is it a religion? Is it Buddhist? Is it Hinduist? Or what? But actually in India, there is a saying that, "Saints have no religion, they are above religions". So, actually, when I say that saints are above religions, it means that when you experience a certain state of union with your Self, this is the same thing that is described in all the religions, all the spiritual techniques or traditions, we can say.

So tonight, we will not speak about religion or we just speak about something which is a state of well-being that you can experience. So just imagine that you have an energy within that starts to be awakened and this energy makes you conscious of your emotional state, physical state, in a much more accurate way than you could ever imagine. Just imagine that this silent energy that also tells you about all the people, how they are inside. And also imagine that this energy can cure you but can also cure others.
So, to be more clear, I will just show you this map behind. And you see, on this map, you have three channels inside the body of the gentleman which is sitting in yoga. And in his body, we have one channel on the left, which is, according to people who practice in yoga, the energy by which you feel things, by which you have the emotions. This is linked to the past. And you have another energy on the right side which is linked to the future, to your energy of planning. We can see the energy of the brain being futuristic, you see, this kind of person who plan their lives, "Tomorrow I have to do this. In ten years, I have to do this".

So, we can say that I am not talking about the middle channel of the body of the gentleman, but we can say that you have two kinds of energy in human beings and Asian people know that very well. This is the yin and the yang. This is the female energy, the male energy, the past, the future, and the emotion, the action. So actually, we are just living with these two energies and this is very difficult to be in the present. Because if you are in the present, means you are not thinking about the future, thinking about the past, you are just there, in reality. And this, if you try to see within yourself, this is very difficult. Because it means also that you have to be above your mental activity.

So, actually, we live in a world which is relative, we can say. And let's say somebody is more on the right side. Let's say that this gentleman here, use more his energy on the right side. What does it mean? It means that in his life, in his everyday life, he will be more, you know, this kind of person which are very active, very logical. In everything they do, they are very logical. And with this, we can say this energy of planning and they are very active with their brain, but maybe they don't have feelings anymore.

So if you are too much on the right side, you will be this kind of person who, after his job, sitting in the car, once he has left the office, he is thinking about tomorrow, "What I have to do, I have to do this meeting, I have to write this note, I have to start this project". It means that you are not in the present, but you are already in your worries about tomorrow, what you have to do in the next week and the next month. And of course, when it is time to sleep, you cannot sleep, because you are still thinking about your job. So this is, we can say, of course this is a gross picture, but we can see that people who are more on the right side, the right-side energy tends to be like this.

So these people suffer. But they also may not be able to suffer, because when we are too much on the right side, using too much of our brain and we don’t use our heart to feel what other people are, how they are, how they react. So we just like to, and we start to see only ourselves, we are more than ego here, this big little balloon here.

So of course, you can imagine, you have also people on the left side, and these people are people who just live with their heart. They have emotions. So this is very nice, but sometimes you can be also dominated by your emotions.

[Talk starts at 1:06:31]
Shri Mataji: I bow to all the seekers of truth. When we talk of truth, we have to know what are we seeking. The truth is, has been, and will be. It cannot be described; it cannot be transformed or changed. Whatever I am saying to you, you should not take it for granted.

We have had lots of trouble with blind faith. But if you experience what I am saying, then it would be better that we accept it as honest people. It is for your benevolence, for the benevolence of your family, for the benevolence of your country, and for the benevolence of the whole world.
You have been already told about the subtle system we have within ourselves. In this, there is a power, in the triangular bone, known as ‘sacrum’, that means the Greek knew that it was a sacred bone. This power is coiled in three and a half coils. And coils in Sanskrit means ‘kundal’ and she- it is a feminine power that she is called as Kundalini. When she is awakened, it's a living process of evolution. It is your own power. She is your own individual. She knows everything about you. She knows about your past. She knows about your aspirations. And she is anxious to give you your second birth.

All the scriptures have described that you are to be born again or you have to know yourself. Even in Koran, Muhammad Sahib has said, "Unless and until you know yourself, you cannot know God". So the first truth is that you are not this body, this mind, this ego, these conditionings, these emotions, but you are the pure Spirit. The second truth is that there is an All-pervading divine Power which does all the human work.

You see all these beautiful flowers, beautiful trees, so much living work has been done, who does this? If you ask a doctor, "Who runs my heart?" So he will say, "It's autonomous nervous system". But if you say, "Who is this auto?" He won't be able to say who is that. Also, science has its own limitations. Firstly, it is amoral. I mean, you can make something nice for living. Also, you can make atom bombs to kill so many. There are many limitations of science. It cannot answer the question, "Why are we on this earth?" With us, the problem is, "Why we don't have peace and why we are so much tortured in these modern times?"

We do not know the absolute truth. We live in a relative world. Also, this mind that we have is a myth. We have ourselves created it by our conditionings and by our ego. As we react with these two ‘ballons’ within us, this mind is created, like, we can say, bubbles. And the bubbles of thoughts keep us out of reality. Speciality of human beings is they react to everything. And thus this mind is created. All wars, all ugly things, all horrible things, all these are created by human mind. But if you know the absolute truth, there will be no quarrelling, no fighting, no arguments, nothing. So what is the absolute truth is this, that you are the pure Spirit, that there is an All-pervading power of divine love and thirdly, that you are a part and parcel of the whole. You belong to one organism or you can call it, one personality.

Actually, no religion is exclusive. For example, Abraham, Moses, were all described by Christ. Especially, Muhammad Sahib described Christ and his Mother in a very respectful manner, more than, you’ll be amazed, in the Bible. She is described in a very honourable way by Muhammad Sahib. So how can you [unclear] Christians [unclear]? All these religions were born on the same tree of spirituality as beautiful flowers. And we have plucked them and now fight with dead flowers. But who follows the religion? Only when this Kundalini rises, she enlightens the religion within. You actually become religious, innately. I don't have to tell you, "Don’t do this, don't do that". You yourself know what is to be done. That means you yourself become a saint. Once you are enlightened in the light of the Spirit, you give up whatever is destructive.

Many people say, "How to give up drugs? How to fight these habits?" In the light of the Spirit, they give up, overnight, all these bad habits, I’ve seen, overnight. At least, thirty percent of the Sahaja Yogis were drug addicts. They gave up drugs, alcoholism, all kinds of bad habits they gave up, without any trouble. Because you do not have inner strength to give up. But in the light of the Spirit, you become so confident, and you just drop off all these bad habits.

This is not only that happens to you. If you see your life, you are always bombarded by the thoughts of the past and the future. But you cannot be in the present. You cannot be in the present: the thoughts come to you from the past or the future. And you jump on the curst of these thoughts all the time. You never can be in the present which is the reality. Because past is finished, future doesn't exist. So when this Kundalini rises, she elongates these thoughts and there is a space created in you, in your attention. And she will go beyond your mind. At that stage, you become a witness, you watch everything. You watch, you enjoy everything. You do not react. If it is something ridiculous, still you know it is ridiculous. But you don’t react. The whole thing looks like a drama.

Like if you are in the water and lots of waves are coming in the sea, you are frightened of those waves. But supposing by some chance, you get into a boat, you can watch all these waves and enjoy. But supposing you know how to swim, you can jump and make many people come in the boat. You cross your mind, as a result you become thoughtlessly aware. You are aware, fully aware, but you are thoughtless. That is how you become peaceful. That is how you become balanced. That is how you become very compassionate. That is how you become very dynamic.

I am very old, as you know, and I travel so much. So they ask Me, "Now, don’t you feel the travelling? " I tell them, "I don't think I am travelling. Thinking about it is tiring. But if you don’t think you are travelling, it’s perfect".
