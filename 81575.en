So, I got pregnant. The day I found out, I came home, and my husband looked at me and said, "Who died in the family?" I said, "Nobody, but I'm pregnant." I was afraid because Shri Mataji had told me not to get pregnant again, as it could be dangerous. But my strong husband said, "Don't worry, I will work on you every day. You have to be positive. This soul has to feel that it is welcomed on this earth."

The pregnancy went on. Again, after Shri Mataji left Austria, I started losing some blood. Every time I would go to the hospital, I thought I would lose the child. I just had to lie down for two days, and everything would be all right. At Ganesha Puja in September, my husband was at the puja, and I went to the gynecologist for an ultrasound.

The gynecologist looked at the ultrasound, and then he looked at me and said, "You see, madam, I have to be frank with you. I don't like what I see on this ultrasound. There is a hematoma." I asked, "What is this?" He said, "It's something behind the placenta. We can't do anything. This will resolve the placenta, and the child will die." Boom.

I was finished. I told the gynecologist, "But maybe you are wrong. Maybe you mixed something up." I was trying to find another explanation. He looked at the papers and said, "Oh, maybe... no." At that moment, I felt vibrations in my hand. And I said, "You see, I know this child is protected." He looked at me, very Catholic, and said, "Wow, you believe in God?" I said, "Yes."

Because I got diabetes during my pregnancy, the gynecologist told me to have a caesarean three weeks early. After the operation, he looked at me and said, "Congratulations. It's a boy. He's really healthy. But you see, it's a miracle. When I took out the placenta, the hematoma was there. In my career, I have never seen this. You believe in God, and He protected you." And he's here.

Our daughter, Aparna, was in the Kuchipudi Academy in Madras at this time. My husband and I wrote a fax and sent it to Shri Mataji to thank her for Lakshmana. Aparna could enter Shri Mataji's room and give her the fax. And Shri Mataji said, "Oh, it's a miracle. It's a miracle. It's a miracle." Three times, she said it. "But I knew she desired this child so much. Lucas is all right, but I will give him a name when I see him. All these great souls just want to incarnate on this earth."

[Another speaker, presumably the husband, begins]

We were in Warsaw. I was driving Shri Mataji to the airport, and she was sitting in the back with Arganesh. I thought to myself, "It would be nice to have an Indian name for our son." So I asked Shri Mataji, very politely and humbly, for a name. She didn't answer at all, so I thought, "Okay, that's how it is," and I gave up. She was talking about other things.

When we arrived at the airport, somebody jumped to open the door for Shri Mataji. She put one foot out onto the pavement, and with a big smile, she said to me, "Lakshmana."

[The first speaker resumes]

So, thank you for listening. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to share these stories and all of our love.

[The husband speaks again]

I've heard these stories from my wife a couple of times, you can imagine, but I'm still moved. Christine, you missed the story about when Mother came to Gerd Nagasa Ashram, and we did aarti to her. And what Shri Mataji said then to us? She said, "It's like a puja."

[The wife responds]

Yes, but Dara, I have searched a lot, a lot, a lot of other stories, and I had to choose.

[Final comment from another person]

So we need another session. That would be wonderful because it's amazing.
