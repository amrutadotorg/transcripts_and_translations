I remember once being at Brompton Square, and I was sitting next to Shri Mataji. I think she was working on me, and she suddenly looked into my eyes. I don't know what happened, but sometimes when she looked at me, it felt like she was looking at something in you that had to be cleared out. This time, it wasn't like that. It was like she looked right, deep into my eyes, and I just... I can't find words to explain what happened, but it was a very profound experience.

Steve?

There was a time when we were doing a little bit of building, and she called a couple of us into the room. I can't remember the reason, but she asked somebody there to sing a song for her. He was quite an older gentleman, and as he started singing this song, I just felt my heart completely opening to him, an amazing love just pouring out towards this guy. Then Shri Mataji suddenly turned to me with a big, huge grin and said, "That's it! That's it!" It's like, how did she know? So I suppose that was something.

Funny enough, after I got my realisation, I was lent some tapes of Shri Mataji's talks by a yogini. I remember sitting in her room, listening to these talks. I think one of them must have been about Mary, and as I was listening, I had this impression coming over me: She really is Mary. She really, really is. All the details that were coming out about things you wouldn't know—about Jesus and his early life—were from the perspective of a mother.

It suddenly dawned on me that yes, she is this person, this Mary. From that moment, one just couldn't go back. It was like confirmation, really, and you knew that you were just very luckily in the presence, during the beautiful time when Shri Mataji was actually here. So it was extraordinary like that.

And did you have any Mary-like experiences?
