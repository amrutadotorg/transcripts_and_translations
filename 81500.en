 (England)
Thank you so much for joining us again for part two of our interview.

Interviewer: Thank you so much. That's very kind of you. We see there's a beautiful meditation room, very artistic, as would be expected from your home. So tell us about it and tell us what it is that you would share with us first and foremost. There's quite a few things that we have in store today, from memories, the presents that Shri Mataji gave you, the photos you have, even excerpts from diaries, because that would be phenomenal as well, to relive those times. So over to you.

Speaker: I think I'll start with this bowl behind me here. A professor came—he didn't show up very often, an Italian guy—and the Ganesha was sitting there vibrating everyone. And he said, "Why doesn't Brigitte do her graduation at the end of the year?" Just out of the blue, I guess. So she ended up doing it. She didn't know what to do. She ended up making that Ganesha because they were doing sculpting, and she wasn't interested in that. She thought, "Why don't I make this Ganesha?"

And then at the end of the year, she couldn't figure out what to do for her diploma work. The only thing she could think of was maybe some bowls for Shri Mataji's feet. So she ended up making these beautiful bowls. There's a picture of them here.

Interviewer: Oh, wow. Beautiful.

Speaker: Yeah. So this is what she came up with. This is 1989, beginning of '89. Then Shri Mataji came at some point and we had the president's suite in one of the oldest palace hotels in the city. The yogis or the leader decided that they would like to vibrate sugar and salt and kumkum and things, so they asked Brigitte for her bowls. We have two; I think she maybe sold the other two, but we have these two, and this is one of them hanging now in our meditation room. We don't have a picture of her feet in it, but we have a picture of the salt or sugar with her footprints in it. I couldn't find that photo now. So this is one of many items we have in this tiny little room here.

That's beautiful. I think this is much in the future, but I'm sure everybody will recognize this. This is from the castle, the Hanuman. He's there in the snow. They needed a present for Shri Mataji welcoming her back. This is how much snow we had at that time, so this was the beginning of 2005. They needed a present, and so Brigitte just said, "Well, she's working on this Hanuman. How about this?" "Oh yeah, that would be great." And we had no idea it would remain in the castle for maybe hundreds of years.

That photo was taken just outside of our cottage here. Actually, we hadn't even built onto our house at that time. It was just an uninsulated cottage with no heating and no bathroom, and that's how we lived for two years in the beginning when Brigitte first inherited it. So the Hanuman photo was taken just outside in the snow here.

Interviewer: You're quite a tapasya there.

Speaker: Well, in a way it wasn't, because we were a couple of decades in ashrams in different countries. And then we were in Vancouver. We thought we'd stay there, and then suddenly we got a phone call that a friend of her grandmother just passed away and left her everything. So suddenly we had a house and a huge property here in Austria. We thought, "No, they need us in Vancouver," so we thought we'd stay there, but we were going back and forth. Eventually, it became clear because we became involved in Cabella.

Interviewer: Which year is this then?

Speaker: Well, we moved here in 2004, and then this work in Cabella started in 2007, so three years later. It was obvious Shri Mataji was pulling us back because we had done whatever we had to do there and we were coming back.

Brigitte just mentioned something this morning... even before, like in '88, and the time we moved away—you could say about 10 years—she was working in our little kitchen. When we went to India in '91, she was so amazed. We went to Jaipur and saw these people on the mud floor, just working, crouching, looking quite dirty, making beautiful things—jewelry, semi-precious stones. No problem working in a tiny kitchen. She would make these huge Ganeshas for countries like Taiwan and Moscow; they went all over the world. She was just mentioning this morning, this Hanuman she made here in the corner of the kitchen before we renovated the shed outside. She would just work like that. She never thought anything about it.

Interviewer: For artists, it's the work that matters, isn't it? And then Shri Mataji does the rest. It's our kind of human expectations, probably more of our modern life where we need things.

Speaker: Yeah, exactly. But she's five times Capricorn, so she's got this, and her horoscope is all earth. So she just takes earth and makes things.

Actually, this is another thing. This is right at the beginning. When I first came, we got married and then I moved from Vancouver. As I mentioned, I was working on the Puja crown for the Guru Puja. So this is an image of the crown in our little flat before Shri Mataji even had it on her head. And another picture beside it is Brigitte. I'm not sure who caught this, but it's a nice photo of Brigitte attending Shri Mataji. She went with Shri Mataji from Austria to Munich, and in Munich, there was the Kartikeya Puja.

Interviewer: Which year is this? 1986?

Speaker: '86. Yes. So that's the crown from four weeks before, and then the Kartikeya Puja in Munich. Wow. That's the crown in our little flat before it was used for the Guru Puja, and then a couple of weeks later in Munich, Germany, the Kartikeya Puja. So in the beginning, it was basically full on all the time.

Here's a few years later, 1992, this is a crown Brigitte made. It was Cabella '92, Ganesha Puja. That was also made in our flat. We had a small flat in Vienna in the early days.

There's another memory. The 1985-86 India tour. This is when we got married. In Brahmapuri, Shri Mataji was sitting in the river, and they just had a shawl over her head. Each person could come and bow in front of her and put the water on their head. So these are photos that we took that were just unbelievable. Shri Adi Shakti was there, sitting in the river and all these things.

Here's from Shri Ganesha Puja. This one is Shri Mataji's bedroom before and after. Brigitte was working on the cornice. So the picture at the bottom is before. You can see the structure, and then that's a beautiful bedroom with furniture and everything. She was working with John Wilkinson and tiling all the bathrooms.

This is a year later in '88, Easter Puja. Shri Mataji... I took this picture of her coming up the stairs.

Interviewer: Wow. Where is this?

Speaker: In Shudy Camps. She's coming up the stairs there. I was standing on the landing, and as Shri Mataji passed, she threw her shawl over her shoulder and it sort of brushed my face. I was like, "Oh my God." I wonder what millions of cosmos just cleared.

When we were there in Shudy Camps, Shri Mataji came later to one of the Vienna ashrams. We had so many ashrams in Austria. She was shopping nearby and she came in and rested just for the afternoon. And here she let some of us wash her feet. They put perfume on her hand and all of us sitting—there were many of us outside the bedroom also—she said we should all smell our own hands. And we could smell the perfume on our hands that they had put on her hand.

Interviewer: Wow. So, to see Shri Mataji, such a nice informal moment, offering water at her holy lotus feet. And then she asked the yogis there to offer the perfume on her hands, and then all of you present there smelled that perfume that was on Shri Mataji's hands. Amazing.

Speaker: I just remembered I've got a towel that was used for that occasion. It was our towel, a pink towel with little elephants on it. Shri Mataji had done a public program and then left, and then we had follow-up. I was really exhausted that day; we hadn't slept the night before. Everybody, the ashramites, all went to the follow-up program, and I just collapsed where Shri Mataji's feet had been. I took the pink towel that they had used, from our bedroom, and I put it on my chest and I just fell asleep. I blacked out.

When I woke up, this towel was lying on the bed. I knew I was so deeply in sleep, there's no way I would have taken the towel off. I thought I had somehow broken protocol because it was within the 48 hours or whatever, and I wouldn't have lain on the bed; I laid on the floor. But the towel... probably I wasn't allowed to use it for my own whatever. So somebody—I don't know if it was Shri Hanuman—took it off my chest and put it on the bed while I was sleeping there. So here it is. You can see the nice little elephants on there.

Interviewer: Oh, yes. So this is the miracle towel that moved by itself onto the bed.

Speaker: Amazing. And yeah, here's another couple of things Brigitte made. For that Ekadesha Rudra Puja, there was not only her first Ganesha statue on the stage, but like the Guru Puja two years before, she made the crown. Maybe people recognize this crown; it's in the castle right now in Cabella.

Interviewer: Which year is this, would you know?

Speaker: 1988, Ekadesha Rudra Puja. She made several crowns, so this was another one of them.

Interviewer: What is it made of?

Speaker: It's sort of a synthetic, hard foil that you can get in different colors, and then she put Swarovski crystal stones all over it. By chance, it matched Shri Mataji's sari. She had the same color sari on. Sometimes those things would happen.

Interviewer: It's incredible, isn't it? How Shri Mataji just works out the color schemes.

Speaker: How it works out. And this is Sri Rama Puja, I can't remember the year. Brigitte had to paint a bow. She made these decorations on the bow that Shri Mataji held at the end of the Puja. We had an arrow with us, and someone had the idea that everybody could write a name of Sri Rama on the arrow with a fine pen. They managed to fit... I don't know if they fit all 108 names, but people were coming to our hotel room, writing names of Sri Rama. And she's got it also in the photo at the end of the Puja.

This was an interesting moment. This is also the end of '87. We just jumped into cars and went somewhere, like from Vienna to Paris. Somebody had a big car and the five of us jumped in. Brigitte stayed home that time, but then I got a surprise. We arrived in Barcelona—it was the first time—and Shri Mataji did a public program plus a Puja in the new ashram. I was at the ashram, and suddenly Brigitte showed up. I said, "What? What happened?" She had some ceramic equipment that she managed to sell, and then she just booked a flight. We didn't have cell phones then, so I didn't know. So there's two moments with Shri Mataji: Brigitte showing her some collective photos from somewhere, and I'm showing her the Austrian present. Just at this moment, we saw on the back, "Oh, it's made in Spain." We wanted to give an Austrian present, and then everybody was laughing.

Interviewer: So an Austrian present made in Spain, presented to Shri Mataji in Barcelona. Amazing.

Speaker: I think we had brought it from Austria, and then we found out.

This story I started last time, and you wanted to know more. Shri Mataji gave us these little lace mats. This was at the airport in Calcutta in 1991. She was just sitting in the airport; there was hardly anybody there because for the Rama Puja in Calcutta in March '91, hardly any Westerners were there. I think four people or something. There were very few Indians there also because Calcutta was quite new. So at the airport, there were just a few people there around her, and she was handing out these nice placemats.

Interviewer: Beautiful. Isn't it? Cross stitch, it seems.

Speaker: Yeah, it is. Beautiful cross stitch. She asked Brigitte when we were flying back. Brigitte was pregnant, and Shri Mataji just sort of meditated for a few seconds. And then we found out that the day before, British Airways had given all their seats in the world free. We missed it by one day, but maybe by Shri Mataji's blessing, they extended it to the next day when we were flying.

Interviewer: Was it a special day?

Speaker: Yeah, St. George's Day, 1991. Suddenly, they gave us the free flight also. The lady at the counter said, "Do you know you're flying free with us today?" We thought that was yesterday. She said, "It's been extended."

Interviewer: Amazing. Shri Mataji must have thought, "Oh, they're flying the next day. I'll make them extend it."

Speaker: And then, because she was pregnant, we got to sleep up in first class on one of these big double-decker Boeings. We had a whole row. The miracle extended, because a few weeks later in Vienna, we got a letter from the office of British Airways that we hadn't received our present of a St. George's Day free flight. So they gave us a check. Not only did we get the free flight, but we got a check for free money. So we were paid twice for that.

Interviewer: Amazing. It is so unbelievable. The Adi Shakti's play, isn't it? And not only that, you get to fly first class because Brigitte is expecting, so nice and comfortable, but also you get a check because British Airways said you get this present. That's Shri Mataji again and again, isn't it?

Speaker: I know. We had a lot of blessings around our son's birth. As I told you last time, Shri Mataji made us start the shop and try to do an art business connected to India. That time in Shudy Camps, in '89, Shri Mataji called us there to give us 50 oil paintings to start an art business. Then she was giving presents to all the boys who were packing because she was moving to Pratishthan. We were downstairs and somebody said, "You have to go up." She also gave us these watches. She was giving out watches on the landing at the top of the stairs before her bedroom. Everybody was packed around, and one girl was handing them out. I think the girl handed Brigitte a blue one, and Shri Mataji said, "Let her pick." Brigitte picked the pink, and she said, "Ah, I knew you'd pick the pink one." So she still has it. It doesn't work anymore, but...

This is something unusual. Inside of here is rice and kumkum from one of the welcome parties at the hangar in Cabella. Every year, the Austrians do this, so one of our jobs was to prepare little packets of rice and everything, measured to the right amount. So each time Shri Mataji came into the hangar, they would have the right amounts.

Interviewer: What's the right amount then?

Speaker: Well, we just estimated. We just put them in little packages so it's easy, just pour that out. Because sometimes new yoginis do it and they don't know. We made it as easy as possible. Anyway, this is from afterwards, like after it was put on her feet and then put into a napkin. So this is one of those times we got this, from her feet. This is up in our cupboard here also.

Also in our cupboard, we have a lot of these things from the wedding. This was actually used in the wedding ceremony, the first time in Ganapatipule, the '85-'86 India tour. This was used to put the ghee or the water, I'm not sure which one. Then Shri Mataji was talking on the microphone, telling them that they should take their talis or things from the puja sets. There's a whole day with Shri Mataji on YouTube. It started in the morning on the beach; she came onto the beach at six in the morning. From there, we went to the makeshift pandal. It wasn't even really a pandal at that time; it was just some palm leaves and balloons. It's also on the video, she's giving out all the silver and the jewelry for the marriage later that day.

Of course, we have all that stuff. Shri Mataji did so much shopping for ashrams and things, and then they were selling it in Cabella later, after she passed away. All this stuff from pots and pans to glasses and tea sets. We were lucky; we got in there and bought a whole bunch of things and made a special cupboard. So those are some of the other items that we got directly from Shri Mataji.

I'll just read you a couple of random excerpts. First of all, this is what you were interested in last time. This is from 1992, because she had gone to Kurukshetra and Yamunanagar. I was carrying this little notebook around with me and I just found it recently. So this is on the fifth of April, 1992. It was a Sunday, and we were on the train from Dehradun to Lucknow. I wrote:

Shri Mataji has been very pleased by the programs north of Delhi in Haryana, especially in Yamunanagar. Every year there will be a program from now on, and a puja there.

And the following year, '93, she did. She says here that she started the tour and then it went down through central India and went for the first time to her birthplace. Shankarji was there on that tour. Brigitte also went; I met up at Chhindwara, but she had started up in the north. She has all these photos of the ladies on the beach in Yamunanagar and all these things. In Yamunanagar, she said there are many tantrics and false gurus doing negative things to the people, and this will be cleared.

From Lucknow... I think we actually stayed at Shri Mataji's house. I used to have photos. It was the house that Shri Mataji built, that she told the story about. I just remember the big balcony that came out like a ship's bow. At least I remember that we went through it. They took us there. Again, we were just a handful of Westerners.

Interviewer: What a privilege to stay in that house, Edward, because it doesn't exist anymore. We had the privilege to visit that house, I think it must have been 2012 or '13 even. And the people who bought that house, we knew a Sahaja Yogi who knew them, so we had the privilege to go and visit it. The way Shri Mataji had designed it was so beautiful, so cool. And the level of the kitchen and the washrooms, you could see the divine design there, isn't it?

Speaker: Yeah, and that story that she told about how cheaply she just made it, like cooking a recipe. It was really amazing to see that. In fact, I think I heard the story afterwards, after I had been at the house. At the public program there, Shri Mataji indicated that the foreigners were listening so attentively even though they didn't understand what she was saying. There were two English people on this mini tour, and two Americans. Otherwise, it was me, a guy named Martin, and three German yogis who were just traveling India and came to Sahaja Yoga there. They're still in Sahaja Yoga in Germany; you see them in Cabella all the time.

Shri Mataji was on the train, going from Dehradun to Lucknow, and two policemen joined us in our compartment. They had just gotten their realization at the train station in Haridwar, and they brought us chai and stuff. At the station in Lucknow, one was holding my hand as we watched Shri Mataji. Shri Mataji was very pleased with the very big but short reception in Haridwar and promised to come next time. I don't know if she actually went to Haridwar again.

I made a separate video of this on YouTube about when I had a private audience with her, because she made us start this art business in Vienna. I got to go upstairs in the Qutab Ashram apartments. I'd been waiting downstairs in the meditation room. I just had some photos to show her about our shop in Vienna. I thought I'd just give it to the leader and go, and then suddenly somebody said, "You can go up now." I was by myself, going in front of Shri Mataji, telling her things.

Interviewer: What did you talk about? After showing the photos, what did she say?

Speaker: I've got a couple of quotes here, because these things I actually forgot until I found this a few months ago. She asked things like—because we had things from other places she shopped at, like Czech Republic glass and porcelain statues from northern Italy—so she asked where I got these beautiful porcelain statues. We went to this shop in 1991, and we bought all kinds of things for our shop. She says, "Oh, where did you get the porcelain figure?" And I said, "From the factory north of Milan where you went shopping for Ganesha." And she said, "Oh, I didn't see this one." And I said, "Yes, they are very beautiful things, Shri Mataji." Then she said, "You also have things from Czechoslovakia," and I said, "Yes, Shri Mataji, the vases."

Then I held up a picture of our son who was just a baby then. When she saw the picture, she smiled and I said, "Yes, Shri Mataji, that's Lincoln." She asked, "Are you happy now?" And I said, "Yes." She would always ask Brigitte if she's happy. One time in America in the 2000s, she saw her at an airport and asked, "Are you happy?" That was before we moved back to Austria, so we were living in a bit of a difficult situation. Shri Mataji was obviously asking. A year and a half later, two years later, we suddenly got this place. So anyway, I'm sure Shri Mataji had all that in her attention.

Then she talked about some other things. There was an Indian yogi at the time from a rich family in Bihar that had a tea factory, and this boy, this Yuvashakti, had designed the packaging. She asked me if I liked the packaging of this tea, and I said, "Yes, very nice, Shri Mataji."

As I mentioned in my other video, I just descended from heaven down to the meditation area again, walked out onto the hot, dusty streets. It wasn't even built up at the time. I was always so frustrated by the rickshaw drivers because they'd always lead you somewhere to make more money. This was at the Qutab hotel. I had to go to Greater Kailash. I thought, "I'm just going to walk," because I was so blissed out. I just walked and walked. I don't know how long it took me, over an hour. I just repeated the Ganesha Atharvashirsha in my head the whole time. I'm not getting into one of these rickshaws. It took me over an hour and I walked all the way to Greater Kailash. I was just totally blissed out.

I'm jumping around. Sometimes I'd write a letter. In the late '80s, we were living in this ashram that I just showed you before, where Shri Mataji came. There were, I think, eight yogis in the whole world that were the first e-mailers in Sahaja Yoga because they worked for the same company and realized they could do inter-computer communication with each other. They would write full reports of what happened on Shri Mataji's visit. So what I would do is photocopy everything. The guy in Vienna would send me a copy, I'd go to a photocopy shop and make copies of all this news for all the new centers in the world, like South Africa, Greece, Slovenia. And every month I'd send out a thick package of all the latest things. I did that for a couple of years. One lady from Slovenia told me, "You know, that kept me going. I was there on my own and every month I looked forward to this package."

This might have been one of the letters I wrote. This is from the Brighton Easter Puja, 1990. We were arriving at this beautiful, old English hotel overlooking a flower garden and a beach. In the lobby, there were yogis sleeping on their sleeping bags. The very concerned hotel manager told us that 200 were expected, but another 100 were coming. So they used one of the big banquet halls to store all these yogis.

By the time Shri Mataji arrived at noon, the whole place was filled with flowers and all our beaming smiles. At first, there were Indian musicians; sometimes the Nirmal Sangeet were there also when they were in Europe. They didn't even have a puja location yet, and then they finally found one in a sports center. There was this beautiful Easter puja, and it says here that the sun was a big orange ball just when the puja was starting.

In the old days, sometimes you'd find yourself in a hotel and there'd be lines of shoes in the hallway. People were inside with Shri Mataji, or people were just sitting meditating in the hallway. You knew where Shri Mataji's room was. So we were just meditating like that, and then the Austrians were allowed to go in. The leader came out and said we should come in. So suddenly we were in this room with Shri Mataji sitting on a chair, with all the flowers and decorations. There were about twelve of us in there talking to Shri Mataji. She told us this thing about doing our business. She was just eating breakfast.

Interviewer: Any advice that would be handy for people who are watching, for doing business, that she gave you?

Speaker: Well, she basically just wanted to spread vibrations. A couple of years later, she brought all this terracotta from a village in India. It ended up moving around in a container all over the place. Unfortunately, a lot of it ended up in storage in Cabella for a long time, and then those were also sold to yogis as donations we could give for Sahaja Yoga. We got a few pieces here from that. So basically, she just wanted to spread all this beauty.

Over that time in Shudy Camps also, Brigitte brought her some porcelain. Brigitte worked for a year in this porcelain company in Austria. She had one simple design that she had to paint on all the porcelain. So this is all hand-painted. She brought a little vase or something with tiny, tiny roses. She gave it to Shri Mataji, and Shri Mataji was looking... they're so tiny, hand-painted. And Shri Mataji said, "Just look at this. You just go thoughtless." So she used to love all these detailed, beautiful little things. She was always trying to spread vibrations through art.

This is earlier. This is another little booklet. So Ganapatipule, the year after we got married, this is '86-'87. This was really magical, like something out of a C.S. Lewis book when he's describing the procession in heaven. This is exactly what happened. We were all there listening to some Indian musicians, and Shri Mataji hadn't come yet. Then I think I had to go to the bathroom, and I realized, coming through the darkness far away, I could see little lights and hear some music. Oh my gosh, Shri Mataji's coming in a bullock cart!

I was the only one; everybody was still inside. They were coming closer and closer. First of all, I was standing with my mouth open, I think. And some Indian man came up to me—I think it was Rajesh Shah's brother who takes photographs—he says, "What do you feel when you see her?" And I said, "Joy." He said, "It is written all over your face."

So then it got closer and closer through the darkness, and I stood up on the side of the dirt road. Then two other guys ran up, it was Greg and Engelbert, and they were standing near me. Everybody else was still in the music program. One thing I forgot that I found in this little diary was that... I remember her coming closer, and just bliss, absolutely. But that she actually looked over at me from under the palm leaves hanging off the bullock cart. And I was just blown away. I thought, how could you... I mean, how many punyas do you need from past lives to even get that moment, just a glance? So that was one of the high points in my life.

I was lucky in '93. I went to the Russia tour, which went from Leningrad to Togliatti to Moscow, and then a few weeks later, went on the North America tour. This was summer of '93. I even forgot that it started in St. Petersburg. I remembered, of course, Togliatti. I think '93 was the first year in Togliatti. We had been there four years before when there was nothing in Russia; they didn't even have food in the restaurants, hardly. Then we went back, and everything was built up because Perestroika had been going for four years. There was all this commercialism and Mercedes and BMWs.

Anyway, we were in St. Petersburg. In the beginning, in '89, there was just a handful of yogis. Now there were lots of yogis. I wrote somewhere that in Siberia, some guys started programs and created a thousand yogis. In Togliatti, there were a couple of thousand people, and they're all just blissed out, seeing Shri Mataji for the first time. But in Leningrad, they had flowers and fireworks. Shri Mataji appeared in the doorway, and there were fireworks, and everybody was just feeling this bliss and love.

From Leningrad to Togliatti, we flew with Shri Mataji. That was like a huge thing. Somebody handed me the international Sahaja Yoga film camera and said, "Can you bring this to Russia?" The guy showed up late; he could only come to Moscow, so I had to sort of film things. In Togliatti, I was filming the public program. At one point, I remember it was in a small stadium, and Shri Mataji was giving realization. She said, "Turn the camera around. Show all the people." They all had their hands up.

Interviewer: Is this in Amruta, this particular one?

Speaker: I think it is. I looked it up recently. In Moscow, it was an interesting experience because Shri Mataji had done so much shopping. I was sort of known to be somebody who was good at organizing stuff. So a couple of leaders said, "Okay, you organize all this into hand luggage for 30 yogis to take to Europe." When everybody went out sightseeing, I spent the whole day in a storage room in the university where everybody was sleeping, trying to get all this stuff into bags. The carpets I couldn't put in the bags; I thought people would have to carry them under their arms onto the airplane. But I managed somehow.

At the airport, Bogdan was the leader, and it was a big miracle. He would tell each person, "Okay, attention on Sahasrara. Okay, go." One person with three bags and a carpet. And somehow, the people at customs... I don't know, it was too much for them or they were going thoughtless or something, and all the yogis were getting through. About 30 yogis with all this huge hand luggage, and somehow we managed to get it all through.

It was so nice in Togliatti. It was just a stage in a field near the famous river, and they just used a parachute over the stage. Afterwards, Shri Mataji spent hours giving presents to all these simple men and ladies and children. Then they would come back and sit down in the grass and try to give it to us, the few Westerners. We were saying, "No, we have enough." They wouldn't speak English. They were so generous.

This is an excerpt from America later. It was an interesting tour. In New York, there was a Muslim leader who had his own TV show. He had a meeting with Shri Mataji, and he wanted to stop because it was time for his prayers. Shri Mataji said, "You can do your prayers to me." So he did; he was bowing down to Shri Mataji. Shri Mataji met the mayor of Yonkers, New York, with his family. It was the first American politician that actually went to Shri Mataji.

At that time, the North American yogis hardly knew any bhajans. This is '93. But Phil Ward was there from Switzerland, so he was leading bhajans with his harmonium, and I brought my bongo drums, so I was also playing. There are always these little miracles and things that happen.

Should I show you our cupboard where we have a whole bunch of stuff?

Interviewer: Yes, please. If you can, that'd be awesome.

Speaker: I'll just show you first, here's a collage we have hanging in our bedroom. This is mainly our marriage in India. And then later, a few months later, we had a ceremony in Austria. Then later, Shri Mataji was holding our baby when he was just two months old. And then he grew up and was in the India school for seven years.

Most of these things in the cupboard are part of the shopping that she did, that we were able to get. They'd take donations and you could pick what you wanted. There's some of the silver from our wedding. This is actually two pieces of clothing that Shri Mataji used. I think her daughter was giving them away in the castle, so there's a sari blouse underneath the shawl that Shri Mataji actually wore. And more of her shopping, and some of her bangles. This was also given by her daughter.

Then we have a cupboard in the kitchen here. This was also her shopping that we were able to get. There's a whole bunch of plates. Some of the sets were incomplete, so you could just buy individual plates.

Interviewer: Do you just use them for vibrations, or do you use them when you have yogis over?

Speaker: Yeah, these are for guests. We take them out. And of course, as everybody has, Shri Mataji cooking in the kitchen.

Interviewer: Oh wow, lovely. Shri Mataji is making burgers.

Speaker: Yeah, we are so lucky. In the old days in India especially, every single puja, you'd have like two pujas a week, and then you'd get the vibrated water. So we still have a lot of the vibrated waters. This is later, in the '90s in Cabella, but here are the old ones. This is Guru Puja '89. And here's Vishnumaya Puja in Wimbledon, 1985. Mahalakshmi Puja, looks like '84 in Belgium. Rome 1985. And here, '85 in Sangli, a little village in Maharashtra, Mahalakshmi Puja.

Interviewer: Have you just kept those waters or used them from time to time?

Speaker: I think we haven't used them in many years. We do have something in the fridge, a mixture, which we use in the kitchen. We just keep it at her altar in the kitchen and sometimes use it. I think Brigitte uses it for all her cooking. And also the vibrated salt and vibrated sugar and vibrated turmeric for cooking.

Interviewer: In all this time, Edward, is there any kind of advice or any piece of wisdom that you could share with the yogis today and to come? From being with Shri Mataji physically and talking to her or listening to her, what's the kind of advice you could share for the seekers now and to come?

Speaker: A lot of the young people I meet... because I'm in Cabella practically every puja, I meet people from all over the world. At some point, I realized I'm meeting all these yogis and yoginis who've never met Shri Mataji, who are just normal, full-on yogis. One of the coordinators in Hungary, she's never met Shri Mataji, but she's full on. And she's at the leader meetings and stuff, just a very young lady.

So I think in a way, it's not necessary to have met Shri Mataji. In fact, some of the people who were always close to her, spent a lot of time with her, were really shattered when she left. Nobody expected she was leaving. I told somebody at our drop-in program in Vienna last year, she said, "It must be somehow important that you had met her." I said, "No, actually, most of the people I meet now are so clear, so connected."

I think there are a lot of born-realized people. Even back in the '80s, I would be on a bus in Vancouver and some little kid would look at me and I'd feel vibrations. I wonder if we'll ever meet again. Shri Mataji has this plan. In fact, I have the feeling sometimes she has like a battle strategy, and she's sending in waves of troops, like born-realized souls. I have no idea how this strategy is going to work out, but I think at some point there'll be a sort of a click where it's obvious that you have to pick this. It'll become easier because it'll be more black and white.

I was telling you before that in '85, I had the blessing of washing her foot in a puja. Just this morning, I thought from the point of view of the divine, that's basically the highest point in millions of years of evolution. I should consider it as such and keep it in my attention as my priority, the center of my whole evolution. My whole universe should expand from that point. I shouldn't just take it for granted, "Yeah, last year I washed Shri Mataji's foot once." It was the Adi Shakti incarnated.

But I think as time goes by... the yogis also have this feeling that it's all going to go wrong again, like in the past incarnations and religions. I think it's pretty fixed. You can't get rid of this; it's only growing. It's making everything more transparent, and it's making people thoughtless, and hopefully at some point, doubtless. I think the only obstacle we have at this point is to become doubtless about ourselves.

I just heard a talk which sort of confirmed that thought I had, that she said you have to get this experience in yourself by using the divinity. Then you realize you're divine, and then you can get more of her also. But as long as we have these blocks or doubts about ourselves, we can't really get into the Nirvikalpa. As soon as we get our own Nirvikalpa about ourselves, we can have more fully the connection to her also.

Interviewer: It helps to just be regular with our time with Shri Mataji, meditating in the silence in the morning and evening, and also listening to her talks and trying to imbibe, isn't it? That's another way we feel really connected and close.

Speaker: Yeah. Whenever we're driving, we always have Shri Mataji's talk on. You pick up on all these things because the further you go, the more clear you get, and then things become significant. Later, you hear the same talk and, "Wow, yes, I get it."

Interviewer: Oh, fantastic. It has really been such a pleasure talking to you, Edward. And thank you for taking your time to share your absolutely incredible times with Shri Mataji that you and Brigitte have had the privilege to have. So thank you for sharing all these beautiful presents, the diary notes... taking us from one continent, one country to the other—from Canada, America, to Russia, to India, and to England and Spain and beyond. Being with Shri Mataji, one seamless world.

Speaker: Yes, it's all one place. This is it. Very kind of you. Thank you so much.

Interviewer: And my love and regards to Brigitte and to you and to the family.

Speaker: She's a bit shy about doing interviews, otherwise...

Interviewer: That's nice. It's a beautiful background behind you. Thank you so much. Thanks for sharing. Jai Shri Mataji.

Speaker: Jai Shri Mataji. Bye bye.
