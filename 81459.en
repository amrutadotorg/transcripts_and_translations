Was there a point you can remember that was a secondary, profound experience—something so impactful that it took you to another level of understanding who Shri Mataji was, or recognition, if you like? Apart from the initial process of self-realization, was there one of those "oh, she's really God" moments? Did you have an experience like that later on, when you were either with her, or she was doing something for you, or something just occurred to you?

Yes. We used to get invited to Shri Mataji's flat in Ashley Gardens, and we used to go there quite often. One morning, somehow I arrived first. I came up, and I was alone with Mother. Mother came in, and the sun was out, and she really looked divine; she looked incredible. She asked, "Do you want some breakfast?" I said, "Well no, Mother," but then I said, "I'll have some breakfast." So a cook brought some halva, Indian halva, and she said, "Oh, sit down." She had me sit next to her; I didn't sit on the floor.

So we had breakfast, and I tell you, I really felt that she was God. It was quite incredible to have her attention on you, personally. I was alone with Mother. It was quite amazing.

Well, I think my first probably profound experience after that was going to my first puja, which was the 2nd of December, 1979—the Guru Puja. Not only had I been asked to put kumkum all over Mother's feet, which was amazing in itself, but Mother gave this talk where she declared who she was: "I am the one who has come again and again to give meaning to itself."

I just couldn't believe there were so few of us. These few people in the whole world, and how lucky that I was there, with these few people, when Mother declared who she was. She said, "This is for Sahaja Yogis' ears only." And she did. And that was so historic. You felt it because you knew. You had known all this time who Mother was.

And we probably had; it was just accepted. Everybody knew who Mother was. But this was the first time she actually said it. And you felt, "Wow, this is historic." It was incredible. And everything changed. Something fundamentally deep, I felt, changed at that point. Even though I remember she said, "Don't tell anyone else," you felt we were moving out now.

Myself and Douglas were transcribing that talk in the Hounslow ashram, and we got so high just transcribing it, listening to it and typing it out. It was incredible. She is the only incarnation, isn't she, that's ever declared who she is.

Yes. And then, in this little two-up, two-down house, Mother would go upstairs and sleep, and all the yoginis could sit around her. We were so few that when we would travel with Shri Mataji, we would all travel together. She so generously stayed in people's houses, and often she stayed at Pam's. The ladies would all be invited in to sleep on the floor in sleeping bags in Mother's room. So it was a very great blessing being a lady in this lifetime.

The boys as well. In the Hounslow ashram, we used to sleep, boys and girls. We used to bring our sleeping bags and sleep with Mother. I guess we should say that it sounds a little odd, sleeping with Shri Mataji, but we soon learned—and she showed us—that this was her way of working out our left side. We would go to Dollis Hill every Sunday. She would come and sit, and we would sit around and she would discuss everybody's problems or what was happening out in the world. And then she would literally make us go to sleep. She would fall asleep, and we would all fall asleep. Then when we'd wake up, she'd go, "Ah, better now," because she would go into the subconscious and work out the left side.

And she would let us rub her feet. But quite often, she wouldn't sleep much at Dollis Hill because she'd be working on somebody. People would be pressing her feet; she'd be pressing theirs. And then the rest of us tried to get a little bit of sleep, but she didn't sleep much sometimes.

Then there would be this funny maya. I remember one night being invited to sleep in her room with Hester. I remember laying down to go to sleep, and then Hester was sitting still meditating. I felt, "Oh, maybe I shouldn't sleep," so I sat up too. Shri Mataji was literally in a deep sleep, but every so often, I noticed thoughts would come into my mind, and she would cough. I would kind of get more alert and go, "Oh, not that thought." Then, after some time, she just said, "Go to sleep now, Hester," from this deep, deep sleep she was in. And Hester lay down and went to sleep. I felt, "Oh, it's okay, too."

So wherever she was, whatever state she was in, she knew everything about every person who was there, everything that was going on. You just could not help but know who Shri Mataji was because all the time she was constantly surprising us with details of things that... how could she know that? How could she know that about me? I never said anything. It was just little things. There was a question, "What miracles do you remember?" I mean, there were so many little things you would count as miracles that it was hard to pick out the big ones.

We went by train once to Birmingham, I think. It was just Shri Mataji and a few yogis, and I was sitting opposite her in the carriage. She said, "You've done karate, haven't you?" I said, "Yes, Mother." I thought, "How does she know that? How could she know that?" So it's quite incredible to have somebody like that in front of you. Something else.

So, we hear on the old audio tapes these fantastic recordings of Shri Mataji chopping in the kitchen and chatting. It's something that is so otherworldly to us who came later—this relationship you had, this day-to-day experience of the goddess in the home. I think people would really like to know, what was that like? In one way, it was obviously just amazing, but it must have also had its intense sides. The fact that you were there, having a meal or going shopping, must have been incredible. Can you remember some recollections?

Yes, after Caxton Hall, we used to go to this Italian restaurant, Spaghetti House. Yes, most of us have been there. Very often, Shri Mataji was there with us. And many times, she invited us to her flat as well when there was nobody there. That was quite amazing as well, just having a meal. Oh, she would cook for us.

Yes, there was one incident. At the Spaghetti House, I remember that Shri Mataji just went into the ladies' just before coming to eat, and I was waiting outside for her. And then she came out—she'd just given the talk—and she said to me, "What do you think of that talk? Wasn't it wonderful?" Completely detached.

And on another point about Shri Mataji knowing all about us, when I came to see her for the first time at somebody's house, she said, "Have you been to any gurus?" And actually, I didn't really know what a guru was, although I'd done an awful lot of terrible seeking. I said, "No." And she looked and said, "Ah, Krishnamurti." And somebody had read that to me every day for about two years. And she knew.

Just on that, knowing everything, I went up to London. I was a big Miles Davis fan, the jazz trumpeter. He'd come out of retirement. He was a very mixed up, caught-up person, but a brilliant artist. I really wanted to see him before the end. Ruth, my wife, said to me, "You must call in on Shri Mataji when you go up to London," because she had said, "If you're in London, come and see me." And I thought, "I don't really want to do that," but it was like a challenge thrown down.

So I very shyly knocked on the door. This was in Brompton Square, her house there. And she said, "Ah, come in, come in, come in." She talked about how she was setting up a brains trust, and I should be on it, and so on. And then somebody said, "Are you ready for the meeting tonight?" I had no idea that she was actually giving a public program that night. And I said, "Oh, my God." I was going to see this musician. I was in two minds. I mean, this is God, but I did want to see Miles Davis. She said, "No, no, you must go. You must go. Give him his realization."

I tried to imagine myself giving him his realization, but I worked very hard during that concert. But it was so nice. She said, "He's an old man. He hasn't got much longer to live. He must get his realization." And I thought, "How does she know about Miles Davis?" because this is not her kind of music. But she knew everything. It was so kind, the way she made the decision for me, and that by going to that concert, I would be doing something worthwhile.

This question of Mother being divine and yet an everyday human personality at the same time is something very hard to describe. But because you're living in the present when you're with Mother, it all flows very naturally. From the moment I saw her, one of the main things I felt was awe. And I always felt this awe for Mother; I'm sure everyone has. But it was always there with me. I didn't have a mother; I don't remember my own mother. So this idea of what a mother is was rather alien to me. It took a long time to get a little bit closer to understanding that this is your mother. It's all right. It's your mother.

Once when she came to Bristol to stay with us for two or three days, I remember greeting her at the door. You do aarti, and she said, "How are you?" I said, "I'm a bit nervous, Mother." She said, "Don't be nervous," just dispelling it like that. So much happened in just an hour with Shri Mataji. Important things, really serious spiritual things, light things which make everybody laugh. You are really living. It's just a very beautiful and deepening experience. So what can I say?

I think the most important thing for me was to do the ritual for the day. I remember speaking to her, and I would be talking to her while she was looking for a tie. She was thinking about shopping that day, and she was looking for pop socks. So kind of mundane. And she wanted a tie for Sir C.P. And Bristol, as she had said, is the Vesudie of England. I thought about it, just working on the collective.
