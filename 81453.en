 (England)
She is the consummate, supreme speaker. She has that hall in her hands. And the way she would switch from a funny joke that made people laugh, into the deepest, most spiritual conversation. Sometimes you would just watch and see the way she moved, and you could see how she would bring the point of the talk back to something else. She was just a brilliant speaker. She once said that she found it very hard to be serious for more than 10 minutes at a time.

Once, I think it was in Brighton at Pamela's house. We often used to go to Brighton for Ganesha Pujas at Pamela's house. We came from London, and we were outside looking to see who was coming in. It was a very narrow street, and Shri Mataji's car, a Mercedes-Benz, was parked on a double yellow line. This big policeman came with his helmet and said, "Whose car is this? That's not allowed." We said, "Well, it's a very holy lady; she's downstairs." So he went downstairs to check. We were waiting outside, wondering where he was. After about 10 minutes, we went down, and he was sitting on a little stool in front of Shri Mataji with his helmet underneath his arm. Apparently, he actually went to India and was a seeker. He got his Realization. He was a big policeman. He forgot all about the double yellow line. It was very funny, that.

She used to make us laugh a lot when she talked about the fashion at the time, of ladies with very skinny legs and short skirts and high heels. She used to say, "Mosquitoes. They're just like mosquitoes." One day in the Dalitil Ashram, Shri Mataji was going up to bed, and I followed her up. My Kundalini was well up, and I just laughed and laughed. She looked at me and said, "What is it?" I could hardly see anything, and I just said, "Mosquitoes." And Shri Mataji laughed and laughed, and we were both almost falling around with this bubbling joy of her laughter. It was an amazing experience.
