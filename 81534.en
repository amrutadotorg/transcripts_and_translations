This was at a freshers' meeting. The people from TM brought a lot of drama for a while because when you tried to raise their Kundalini, they had really dramatic effects. They'd scream and howl and jump and do all kinds of things, just from raising the Kundalini or starting to say a mantra. You could actually see the power of these vibrations; it was quite interesting.

A lot of their friends came, and more and more were coming, but the TM organization got wind of it and started telling them things like, "If you go near Sahaja Yoga, you'll have lifetimes of doom," or something like that. So they all ran away. But for a time, we had quite an influx.

Combined with all the new seekers, the whole thing changed because it got a lot heavier and more difficult. We weren't on our own private plane with the goddess anymore; it was more like a collective thing. It was very powerful, but it was different. It was heavy.

Relating to something you said earlier, once we weren't getting such personal attention and there were so many more people in the collective, I really started to go through a lot of heavy stuff which went on for a long time. It got to the point where it needed to work out, because I wasn't being held up by Shri Mataji in the same way anymore. I had to take my chances and work it through.

How did you do that?

It just happened. I didn't have to do anything. I just had to hang on in there. It's like riding a bucking bronco and hoping that you're still on at the end of the ride, basically. I used to get very down sometimes. On one occasion, I was really depressed. The way she got me out of it was she took her bangles off her wrist and hung them on my ears. That did it. From then on, other people joined in and it went on. A million things happened. That's more or less what happened, very briefly.
