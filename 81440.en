The Flatland Society was there, weren't they? They used to come in. But the thing I remember most is the first-ever public meeting because we really didn't know what to expect. We had no idea. Then Shri Mataji actually made us sit on the stage. Oh my God. Yes, on either side of her, like pigeons... Oh, it was so embarrassing. We were completely red because we were burning up. We had no idea what to expect or who was going to come. Oh my goodness.

That was just for the first meeting. I presume it was so that the people would know who we were. At the next meeting, fortunately, we didn't have to sit on the stage. The meetings were quite amusing, really, because Mother would turn up around 7:00 or 7:30 and give her talk. Then she'd go around checking everybody. I remember the old guy, the caretaker who was there, would start turning the lights off at about half-past ten. Mother would just carry on and take no notice. Eventually, he got used to the way we operated because Mother wouldn't stop until she was finished. It got to the point where he just waited for her.

Quite often, she'd work on all the new people, and she wouldn't go until the job was finished. We used the Great Hall for quite a long time, but then, after a couple of years, we started using the small hall upstairs as well.

One interesting thing I remember was a demonstration by the National Front outside the hall. Mother said, "Oh, don't worry. When the fox wants to die, it comes to the town." And that started the demise of the National Front. We also had some politicians speaking one night in another hall. We left our bag behind, and they had to call out the bomb squad to defuse it. Who was it? One of the Conservatives, I think. It was quite funny.

But that first public meeting was really awesome. I mean, it changed, Sergio, it changed. It was incredible. In two hours, we went into the meeting as one thing and came out as another. It was just completely electric... like the lights got put on. It was like changing gears, like a whole new era was starting. You could feel it, couldn't you? It was just amazing.

At that time, there were these phases, weren't there? Because the first time we met was at a video showing; it was like an introduction.

"Well, I wasn't there, Doug."

"You were at that video one."

"No. Honest, it wasn't me. Marie brought me to..."

"Yeah, she did go there. Marie went there... She brought Pat and me to Judd Street."

"Oh, right. They went there from that Hatha Yoga teacher. Right."

Well, let's put it this way, then. We went to Bharata Vidya Bhavan, and that was like an introduction. From Bharata Vidya Bhavan, we went to Judd Street. Now, Judd Street was like a germination because one or two more people came in. After Judd Street, we went to North Gower Street, and I think that's where it started to take root. You could feel it; the roots started to grow. Then, coming here, the plant was starting to grow. It was starting to flower. That's what I think. It was a real change; it definitely changed.

And then we had all these new seekers coming, like Bogdan and Bala.

"Bala will be coming to England next month, I think."

"Oh, great."

"Bogdan came to the first-ever one, the very first night."

"Yes, that's right. And Bala came to about the second. Grissom came..."

"No, no. He was already there. He was from a long time before. He came for the first Mind, Body and Spirit."

"Yes. But who else was it who came to Caxton Hall? Somebody... David Baxter."

"David Baxter! Oh, yes."

He got his realization. He rang us up at the ashram about four days later and said, "Excuse me, how long does this bliss last?" I said, "What do you mean?" He said, "I can't do my job. I'm dissolving in bliss! What am I going to do?" He was a reporter. That was hilarious. He was always funny. He moved into the ashram with us. David Baxter.

"Sorry, can I just stop you guys for a moment?"

"Okay."
