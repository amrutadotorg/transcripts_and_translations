 (England)

Interviewer: Good morning and a very warm welcome to you, Alex Henshaw, and Felicity Payment, for this part two of your interview, Alex. Thanks for joining us here. It's minus two and sunny in this Garden of England. Felicity, who's joined from Gloucestershire, is it pretty much like here?

Felicity: It's beautifully sunny, it's warmer.

Interviewer: It's summer probably where you are, Alex, isn't it?

Alex: Yeah, I'm currently in Australia, in Melbourne, and today's been a bit overcast, but it's like 26, 27 degrees, so it's not too cold. We've had some very hot days, 29, 30 degrees the last few days, so it's cooled down a little bit, which is a bit of relief from the heat.

Interviewer: Amazing. Your part one of the interview was very much appreciated by the viewers, and thank you for that, for your comments, everyone. They appreciated how you had shared very earnestly and honestly your interactions with Shri Mataji, so it's great to have you back here for part two.

In our first episode, we had talked about how you got your realisation and your times with Shri Mataji in England, in Brompton, Scotland. Where would you like to take us on your journey from there? How Shri Mataji asked you, or how it happened that you went to Hong Kong and then on to China, and how Sahaja Yoga spread there?

Alex: I'll pick up from where I left off, which was basically in Brompton Square with Shri Mataji. She then travelled back to India. I accompanied her, which was just Shri Mataji and myself on the plane. This is something that really surprised me about the English back in the day, and I think Felicity might remember those days, where there was a real Nabi problem. They had only bought Shri Mataji an economy ticket on the plane to go from London to Bombay.

Anyway, when she came to the plane, it turned out there was a yogi, I think Captain Chandra his name was, flying the plane. He found out Shri Mataji was on the plane and he immediately upgraded both of us to business class. In those days, it was a lot more comfortable in business class than it was in economy, so it was kind of a surprise that the English had just bought Mother the cheapest ticket they could find. It was a bit of a shock, really.

Aside from that, it was a lovely flight. I remember just having that time with Mother on the plane, which was really wonderful. You're just sitting there, and she was talking about the English and the Nabi, and that spurred all this talk about the English. She was saying that they have to work it out and should be able to understand the importance of treating her in the right way, with the right sort of transport and ticketing and that kind of thing. So that was interesting.

Then at the airport, she was saying it's always sad to leave, but then she said, "All my children will be in Mumbai." So we arrived at the airport, and it was just chaos. There were so many people there with flowers, and she received people and took all the bouquets. Everybody was accompanying her to the car, and I sort of took all the luggage, helped with it, and put it in the car. The car went off, and then all of a sudden, I realized I was left behind. There was nobody that thought, "What happens to me?" I said I was supposed to be accompanying Shri Mataji, but I got left behind. Luckily somebody took me over to where Shri Mataji was staying.

So I spent those days with Shri Mataji. Then we went on a tour of Maharashtra. This is before the India tour had started...

Interviewer: Remind us of the year, the time.

Alex: Oh, sorry, this is 1984, the end of 1984. So it was the '84-'85 tour, but this was before the Westerners had arrived. It was like a mini-tour that we did with just a few yogis. Mother was driven, and I was sort of hitching a ride with a couple of other yogis. We went around Maharashtra, visiting villages. It was amazing because there weren't any... there were small venues like schools, and then the place was just completely packed with people coming to see her.

I remember we went to Alibag Village, which was on the coast, and we stayed at Mr. Coley's house. Mother was there for a couple of nights, and there was a big program. All the fishing villagers came out to get realisation. It was amazing. There was just such strong vibrations; it was really tremendous. And seeing... it was like a sea, because the fishermen are very dark-skinned from working in the sun. It was getting dark, and all I could see were the smiles on their white teeth, because it was very dark, and that just lit up the whole place. They all sort of put their hands up because they felt the cool breeze, and they were all just in deep meditation. It was a really wonderful experience.

And then the Europeans arrived, and we did the India tour. That year, I got married. Then I traveled back to Australia with my wife, left Shri Mataji in India, and went back to Australia. For the next couple of years, up until I think it was 1989, I was attending the tours. I obviously did the tours in Australia with Shri Mataji, traveling around to different cities, and I was often doing the video camera work. That was something I picked up in the UK, and then I continued to do that for her trips around Australia and also into Asia.

It was on one of those trips to Asia, I think it was '89, where she traveled around to the different countries. We went to Malaysia, Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, and then came back to Hong Kong. That was basically the time where she asked me to go to Hong Kong. It was a really spontaneous situation because we had just done this tour, and the Hong Kong program was cancelled. The yogis that were there—well, they were sort of yogis, I wouldn't say they were established—had no idea how to arrange a public program. They'd only booked their private club and invited their friends. They were actually expats from New Zealand that had organized it.

When Shri Mataji found out, she said, "I'm not going there just to give the English johnnies realisation. I have to go there to give realisation to the Chinese." This was a big shock, and then it was cancelled all of a sudden. We ended up having to go there because the flight was leaving from there, and then she was traveling back to India from that point.

Anyway, we had everybody packed into a tiny little hotel room, and Shri Mataji was talking about how we were going to establish Sahaj in China and Hong Kong. She said Hong Kong is the key, the gateway to China; the key place which needs to establish Sahaja Yoga. I traveled back from Taiwan, and I thought—there was a yogi there, Michael Staniforth, who was working in Taiwan and had a business there. He said, "Look, there's lots of work," because I'm in design engineering, product design. He said there were lots of opportunities for designers and engineers in Taiwan.

So I spoke to Shri Mataji, because I felt maybe I could go and give a hand. It was my background, so I could get a job and I could work and support Sahaja Yoga in Taiwan. I mentioned this to Shri Mataji, and she said, "No, no, not Taiwan. You come to Hong Kong."

We were staying in an airport hotel, a very tiny little room, and we'd walked around this area. I thought, "Who on earth would want to live in a place like this?" It was hot, it was sticky, it was just built-up high-rise tenement houses, and really grotty. I thought, "What a hell of a place to live." And then Shri Mataji tells me, "Oh, you come to Hong Kong," and I just went, "Oh, dear, what have I done?" because the first impression was quite bad. Later on, after she left, I stayed back and had a better look around Hong Kong, and I realized it's actually quite a nice place.

So then I just set about preparing and winding down what I was doing in Australia. I had a job, and I was starting a new business, and I had to wind all these things up. And family, of course; at that stage, I had two children. It took me about eight or nine months to get all that sorted out. Then finally, I got a working visa in Hong Kong and I was able to go there. I literally left with just whatever money I had. Being a yogi, we had full faith in Mother to work it out, so my family and I just moved up to Hong Kong.

I established Sahaja Yoga, but there was a yogi whose wife was in Australia, and she would travel up to see him every few months. They were separated by distance, but he said, "Oh, you can come and stay at my place." His place was a big flat, with an office in the front part and his residence in the back. He rented us one office room. It was a small room, not terribly big. It had two sections; we put the children in one section, and we had the other.

It was August, very hot and humid. There was an air conditioning unit in the room, and when I turned it on, all this black soot came out of it. So I had to turn it off, clean the filters, and get it working. Finally, this cool air was coming, and I thought, "Thank God the air con's here." Then about half an hour later, more black smoke came out and the whole thing blew up. So we didn't have air con. It was really hot, and we didn't have a huge amount of money, so we just went out and bought one of these pedestal fans that just circulated the air.

But the room was so noisy. It was right on the corner of the tram line, and there was a flyover about 20 meters away. There was traffic noise, it was a huge intersection, with the honking of horns and the high-pitched grinding sound of the trams going around the track. I was just lying there thinking, "What have I done? We've been displaced." It was a big adjustment for us in the beginning.

But we were running programs, and we were planning for Shri Mataji to come the following year. This was '91, and she was going to come in March of '92. So we were planning to get everything organized. It was a big learning curve. I didn't speak the language, and there was just a handful of people there. There was one girl who'd moved from the UK; she had Chinese parents and spoke Cantonese but couldn't read or write it much. She was a designer. So we ended up forming a little design company with her and my ex-wife at the time.

I couldn't get work. I got a little bit of contract work, but it only lasted for a short time. Then I had to reinvent myself and start a design company. It was pretty touch and go there for a while. At one stage, I was just down to the last bit of money I had left, and that was going rapidly because of all the expenses. We had to pay for schools, rent, food—all these things were just adding up. More money was going out than coming in, which is always a difficult thing.

I reached that point where I had to make a decision. I ended up having to send the family back to Australia because they had return tickets. They went back for a period of time until I could get things more stable, work-wise and financially. Then I reached the point where I had to call Shri Mataji and say, "Shri Mataji, I'm sorry, I have to leave Hong Kong because I haven't got enough money to stay. The job situation isn't working out."

She said, "No, no, no, no. What are you doing?" I explained that I'd started a business and been trying to get work, but there wasn't a lot around. She said, "Don't worry, I'll give a bandhan." So she just gave a bandhan, and within a week, all this work started coming in. I was just flat out. It was a miracle. Mother just said, "No, no, stay there. I need you in Hong Kong. I need you there to work things out." She just gave a bandhan, and it all worked out.

All these jobs came through. I'd gone around to many companies, pitching design work and services we could offer, and nothing had come through. Then all of a sudden, everybody wanted us to do this project and that project. It all worked out very quickly. I brought the family back, and we managed to get a bigger ashram. Then some yogis came in from Australia, and we had some local yogis that moved in as well. We ended up establishing a little ashram.

Interviewer: How many people in all?

Alex: We had about six, seven, eight people in the ashram at that time.

Interviewer: That's a good number.

Alex: It was a good number. We were doing programs a couple of nights a week, and we were hand-billing and postering, working up towards Mother's visit. In those days, that was our only means of advertising—postering or using the newspapers. There was no internet, no social media. We had designed beautiful posters for Mother's trip.

We organized a radio interview with some very new yogis. They weren't really established, but they were Chinese, and the interview was in Chinese. We booked the hall, and then Shri Mataji came. There was this big storm, and we were up all night, postering in this torrential rain, putting these posters up in the middle of the night around the streets of Wanchai. It was really a special time because you're doing Mother's work, that's it, and the ganas are helping.

Interviewer: Was the poster in Chinese then, obviously? I'll just quickly share and I'll show you. Let me just share it. So in Hong Kong, they speak Cantonese or Mandarin?

Alex: They speak Cantonese. Let me just share this. Can you see that?

Interviewer: Yeah, nice.

Alex: Okay. So this on the right-hand side is the poster we designed. My company actually did that; one of our designers put it together. We had this idea of the sun and the moon.

Interviewer: Oh, yes.

Alex: It's a lotus here, and it basically says, "self-realisation," and then the details in Chinese. This is a picture of Hong Kong at night. It gives you an idea of the vibrant city. This was 1992.

Interviewer: Isn't the script read right to left, in the opposite way from how we do it in English?

Alex: Yeah, and then down. We read this way.

Interviewer: That must be very different spatially, that you read down. I think your brain must have to kick in a different way.

Alex: They start learning to read at the age of two. By the time they're five, they have memorized maybe 2,000 characters.

Interviewer: It's a very complex language, isn't it?

Alex: It is. It's a pictorial language. These are abstract pictures of things, and it's evolved over thousands of years and become very stylized. If you look at calligraphy, it's just so beautiful. The writing is in itself an art form. So, this was the poster that we put together for that particular program.

We had Mother's arrival, and we put her up in the best hotel we could afford. Luckily, we got some help from Australia at that time because there were very few of us. Some yogis came up from Australia, and we got financial support. We were able to hire a big hall and put her up in the Peninsula Hotel, which is a very prestigious hotel in Hong Kong.

Luckily, there was a friend of C.P. Srivastava living in Hong Kong. His father ran an international shipping company, and through that, he knew C.P. very well. He was the son of this tycoon, and he kept in touch with C.P. over the years. C.P. would always put an order in for his white, silk-collared shirts that he used to wear. We had his car and his chauffeur drive Mother around. It was a great asset to have Mother driven around in a nice Mercedes. We'd pick her up from the airport, take her to the hotel, and then we'd often go shopping down in Stanley Market, which is on the south part of Hong Kong Island. It's a famous market, and they have a lot of handmade items.

Mother would always go to this particular shop called Tong's Linen. They have beautifully hand-crocheted tablecloths and hand-embroidered things. She used to buy a lot of handicrafts there; she always loved it. We used to take her to this Chinese Emporium with all these hand-crafted things, and she used to buy a lot of handicrafts from Hong Kong every year she came. It was always a joyful time to go shopping with Shri Mataji in the car.

Felicity: We should say that there was a deeper symbolic meaning behind Mother's shopping trips. She said that everything she touched or looked at absorbed her vibrations, so that when other people came to shop after her, they would all get these vibrations and their Kundalinis would be awakened. Also, she was so supportive of handicrafts and all these artisan things you're talking about. She said that when we as yogis—and obviously she's the divine—purchase these things and support these industries, they become more successful, and this spreads out into the collective country.

Alex: She was always supporting local handicrafts. She said that handmade things have vibrations, they resonate with her vibrations, and they basically create this vibrational coefficient which spreads out in the community. As you're saying, Felicity, it was very important for her. Whenever she touched things, we'd buy those things because we knew the significance.

The programs we had that time, we managed to get an interview with these very new yogis. These ladies had gotten some benefits; their anxiety and insomnia had been cured. So they were very positive about talking. They didn't have a lot of knowledge of Sahaj, but they knew they'd benefited from the meditation. We managed to get them onto RTHK, which is like the BBC in Hong Kong. There was a radio program in Chinese, and this program aired with the interview with these ladies. It was very successful; a lot of people were interested.

On the night of the program, the hall was absolutely full of Chinese people. Shri Mataji walked in, and she was so happy to see Chinese people there to receive their realisation. I think she was just overjoyed because she said she'd tried to reach them but never had the opportunity. This was the first time we had so many in one place.

During the program, one of the newer ladies was trying to translate, and she wasn't that good. Then somebody from the audience just popped up and said, "Look, I'll help." He came up—he was a university professor—and he was able to translate so well, everything that Shri Mataji said. So all these little things just worked out for the program.

Back in the car, Shri Mataji held my hand. She said, "You've done it. You've done it. We've got the Chinese."

Felicity: That expression, "you've got the Chinese"—in those days, we should help people understand that Shri Mataji was just so completely focused and dedicated on getting into every country she could. I remember her waiting and waiting to get to China. Around the same time or a little bit afterwards, Russia too. It was a huge thing in the collective that suddenly Mother was meeting the Chinese and meeting the Russians and giving them realisation, going into these big superpowers. It wasn't all that easy in those days to actually do that, was it?

Alex: Well, we were lucky in Hong Kong in a sense that it was still under British rule and was very free and open. There were no restrictions on what programs we could run. Through these programs, we established the first group. In the discussions after the program, Shri Mataji said we really need to look after them as much as we can to make sure they can really establish and understand me. So we really put a lot of effort into working with these people.

Our biggest challenge at that time was that we didn't have a lot of materials translated into Chinese. Luckily, there was one lady who got realisation and managed to get a friend of hers who was very good at translation. He helped to translate from the English brochures we had into Chinese. He was actually the head of a very large advertising agency called BBDO, a very famous company globally. He was humble enough to even do our translations for us. It was a very special time.

Later on, another yogi came back from England, a Chinese yogi called Albert. He was able to translate a lot of the materials and spent a lot of time translating Mother's books. Then we started to do the subtitling on the videos. The first ones we did were overdubbed. We showed Shri Mataji and she said, "No, no, no, you shouldn't overdub my voice. It's not good." She told us that we should always use subtitles, and that goes for all the different translations we do. I know in some countries they overdub Mother's voice with somebody else's voice, and she said we shouldn't do that.

Felicity: Because it interferes with the vibrations, doesn't it? Even if you can't understand what Mother's saying, you are feeling all her vibrations working on you. Then your mind can read the subtitle, and you can understand. I was on an India tour, and I remember Mother just spoke in Hindi, and I still got realisation and my chakras all cleared. The words are helpful—Mother said we must understand what's happening—but the most important thing is to actually experience Shri Mataji's vibrations as they're flowing and working. So important she actually said, "Don't voice over her."

Interviewer: So important to hear the voice of the divine, isn't it? There's nothing quite like that. It's good to be reminded in these days where a lot of Photoshop has started happening on Shri Mataji's photographs and videos. Yes, it's a very important incident to relate. Carry on, please.

Felicity: Can I interrupt? I know you're in the middle of sharing, Alex, but it just came to me that people don't realize that in those days there was no YouTube, no internet, nothing. So when Mother gave a program, it was recorded. You did the video. Can you talk a little bit about living in Hong Kong and how you would get access to the talks that were happening around the world? How did it work for you being in a kind of outpost?

Alex: We were supported a lot from Australia because that's obviously where I came from, so I was able to tap into that support network for videos and talks of Mother. On our trips to India, of course, we would get a lot of things as well. We started a team to translate everything into Chinese. In mainland China, they use the simplified form of Chinese, which came after the revolution. But in Hong Kong and Taiwan, they have the traditional, full form of Chinese. You'll find that a lot of the Chinese communities around Asia use that traditional form.

We tried a lot of different things to find the actual spiritual terms. You have to look into Buddhist writings, you have to look into Taoist writings, to try and find similar references. You have to be careful because you can't be too Taoist or too Buddhist; you have to have a balance. You can't just translate from the Sanskrit; you have to find words that the Chinese people themselves can relate to.

You've got to remember that China is a very ancient civilization, 3,000-plus years, so like India, it has a lot of tradition of spirituality. They have Taoism, which Lao Tse established, and they have Confucianism, which is more about the right side—the structure, governance, respect for elders, and good administration. So they've got the spiritual, poetic Taoist scriptures, a tradition of poetry, and the beautiful calligraphy as an art form, and the beautiful Chinese paintings.

Shri Mataji loved all of the arts. She said that the Chinese kept their arts alive. They have these state-owned factories churning out this stuff, but there were still artisans doing the pottery, the ceramics, the silks. In Hong Kong, we had a lot of those big emporiums from China. Sadly, a lot of those shops have shut down now because people aren't buying those arts anymore. Shri Mataji said we should support these artisans, because if there's no demand, their arts will die away. After that generation passes, there won't be people to take it on. She was very supportive of the arts and said how important it was for us to buy and support these things of beauty instead of cheap plastic, disposable things.

Whenever she came, we'd always go out and look for beautiful art objects and sculptures. One of the advantages of living in Hong Kong was that we had access to all of these beautiful sculptures, embroideries, crochet work, and linen. We could always find something really nice to bring to Shri Mataji for her birthday or for the pujas. We gave her these beautiful jade items. It was always a nice time to spend looking for something really unique to bring to Mother as a gift.

Interviewer: So when you were there, did Shri Mataji talk about the importance of semi-precious stones, for example, jade? And are there some photos you would like to share with us at this point?

Alex: Yes, I can. Let me just have a look. These are from 1995. Now, '95 was a very important year because this is the year that Shri Mataji came to visit Beijing for the Women's Conference. I'll talk about that as well, because that's a significant time.

Interviewer: Would you like to share photos from her first visits? We can do it in a chronology.

Alex: Okay. So this is 1976. Shri Mataji visited China a couple of times. This was on an official visit with C.P., and she met with dignitaries. She talks about a beautiful story where one of her earrings had fallen out on the pillow in the hotel, and they found it and took it to the next place she was staying to give it to her. She said they were just so careful; everything was done very nicely. She always had a lot of respect for the Chinese because they really looked after her.

Felicity: Mother looks so young. We never saw her...

Alex: Yes, this is when she was living in London. She was doing Sahaja Yoga, and she had started a group there. In India, they already had realisation. These are some shots of that first trip she did.

Here, this was the '84 trip, and she met with some Chinese dignitaries. In fact, she met with Li Peng, who was an official in those days and later became the Premier of China.

This is a trip she did down the Yangtze River. She described it very poetically in the talk she gave at the first public program we had in Beijing in 1995. She said, "I did this trip down the Yangtze River," and she said, "The Yangtze is the Kundalini of China." She described how it was just like the beautiful Chinese paintings, with mountains and mist on the water. She said they travelled down the river, and it was such a beautiful trip because they could just sit and watch the scenery unfolding before her. She ended up in Wuhan, which is the heart of China, in the center.

So her attention on China had been there for a long time.

Interviewer: So this is '84. From this time to when she went in '95, that was her first official visit where you were able to do Sahaja Yoga programs in China?

Alex: Yes. She didn't have an opportunity to do any programs on these earlier trips because they were official trips with her husband. She was accompanying him in an official capacity, doing sightseeing and meeting with the leaders' wives. That's her on the Yangtze. She was vibrating all of China, spending time... 11 years before, she was preparing China vibrationally for the visit.

This is the Temple of Heaven in Beijing. It's a special place, built by the emperor. It's a very significant place for worship, a really special Buddhist temple. It's so amazing that she went there and walked around it, because all her vibrations would have blessed this place that so many people have come to visit afterwards.

Interviewer: 1992.

Alex: Yes, these are some photos from the programs. This is in Hong Kong, because she didn't go to China at that time.

Felicity: How many visits do you think she made to Hong Kong before she got to China in '95?

Alex: She came in '92, '94, and then '95. And when she went to Hong Kong, were those also part of an Asian tour? Yes, it was part of the Asian tour.

Felicity: Was that the precursor of the Music of Joy tours then, later?

Alex: This was long before Music of Joy tours started. We're talking about the nineties, and Music of Joy was much later, like 2005.

Interviewer: Share the Asia tour photos, that would be nice.

Alex: Okay, this is '95, the year she went to Beijing. This is the public program in Hong Kong. This is a bhajan group before Shri Mataji arrived.

Interviewer: There are a few of you there, isn't it?

Alex: In '95, we had a good-sized collective. This is in the hotel; Shri Mataji was showing us a bhajan and singing. This is Beijing. Herbert Reiniger was actually... no, he was living in Hong Kong at the time. This is John Kula and another young lady from Australia. All these yogis, we travelled... Herbert was living in Hong Kong because Mother asked me to give him a job in my design company.

Felicity: It's interesting as you're sharing about establishing Sahaja Yoga in Hong Kong. It reminds me of how we were establishing it in Vancouver. You had to have a nucleus of yogis. When we started, we were just seven in a little ashram. You see over time how the vibrations start to change in the city. When we moved from seven to like 16 yogis, you could feel the gravity and the roots of the vibrations going down. I can understand Mother saying, "Give Herbert a job," because he was such a strong, established yogi, and you needed everybody you could get. The more established yogis you had in that city, the more new people you could support.

Alex: Exactly. That was the interesting conversation I had with Shri Mataji. She said, "Establish 12 yogis in Hong Kong, and then I can work out the whole of China." I thought, "Wow." She said, "The Chinese, once they come to Sahaja Yoga, they'll be the best. They'll be very focused and very serious, dedicated yogis." And that's basically what we see today. They're extraordinarily dedicated and have a lot of bhakti and devotion towards Shri Mataji.

But getting those 12 Chinese yogis in Hong Kong was challenging. We were in the most materialistic sort of place, where people are working so hard, very right-sided, and not interested in spirituality. There are seekers, of course, but the average Hong Konger is just interested in making money and surviving. It's tough economically. People are very serious and hardworking. The challenge is, how do you break through to those seekers and get them established? It's hard if they're so right-sided. Their liver's hot, their mind can't sit still, they can't go into thoughtlessness.

It was like a revolving door. I'm sure you've had the same experience. People would come—after Mother's visit, there might be a group of 35, 40 people, fantastic. Then after six to eight weeks, we're down to 10 people. After a few months, we're down to five. Why aren't these people sticking on? You might end up after a program of a couple of hundred people with just a handful of yogis that established. But that core group, they're the ones that have been filtered out; they're the diehard seekers which are left.

Felicity: And that's why it was so important to have a core kernel of established yogis, even from other countries, because whatever happened, you were still there, sticking it out. I wanted to pick up on what you were saying about Mother saying, "12 Chinese, we can work out the whole of China." I remember when a yogini came from Poland, she was the first one, and Mother said, "Ah, now we can work out Poland." Because as this yogi comes from their country, all the conditionings start to clear through their chakras. As each one of us from our culture starts to clear, it has a collective effect on other people from our culture, even before they get their realisation. So that's why she was saying, "If I have 12 Chinese, as they establish and continuously meditate, I can work out all their problems and it will start to spread through China."

Interviewer: With families expanding and the collective growing, were you still able to keep up the discipline of the ashram life in the nineties?

Alex: Yes. I'd grown up in the ashram in Turramurra, which was the hub of Sahaja Yoga in Australia, so that gave me the discipline. We did have that discipline, which I brought into the ashram. We all got up for collective meditation, we had rosters for household chores, all those things. We kept that ashram discipline, and it was very important because we had new yogis coming and joining us, and that core discipline helps them to establish.

Our group was all expats—people not from Hong Kong. We had an Australian couple, two men from the UK. We all lived in the ashram. We were all foreigners, and you have to learn the Chinese culture. Sometimes it was awkward when you saw how culturally insensitive some yogis were.

Felicity: It's so different. Our Western culture is so ego-oriented and not sensitive to people's feelings, whereas the Chinese culture is completely focused on not upsetting people, much more respectful. They're like opposite cultures in a way.

Alex: And it's by example. You have to live up to those values as a Sahaja Yogi. You can't say one thing and do another. They just watch how you behave, how you act, and you have to be mindful of that. You have to have that sensitivity; you cannot make people lose face. That's the worst thing. You can't dress somebody down in front of others.

In the beginning, it was interesting because we had a lot of hardcore seekers. We had these Tantric Buddhists that came along. Every week we'd do a program, it was really heavy. We'd exchange vibrations, clear them out, they'd all feel fantastic, and then they'd go away. The next week, they'd come back, and the vibrations were super heavy again—the void was catching, the Swadishthan. This was going on week after week. I asked one of them who was more established, "It seems that every week they come, the vibrations are back to square one. What's happening?" He said, "Oh, they're still going to their Tantric Buddhist master, this Lama that they were seeing."

So I had to say to them, "Look, this is the truth. This is Shri Mataji. She's the incarnation, she's the Maitreya. This is your opportunity to have the enlightenment that you were looking for with the Buddha." Anyway, to cut a long story short, most of them dropped out after that because I said you have to make a choice between coming to Sahaj or your Tantric Buddhism. We had like 25 of them, and then we were down to about three or four. But it was a relief in a way because the vibrations just lifted after that.

Felicity: That's what we saw in Vancouver. When you're first establishing in a new country, you get all the false guru people coming. Very heavy. You try, and eventually, you have to say to them, "You have to make a decision." And just like you, they sort of drop out. Then you get the next layer, which is a little bit more simple. It's like you have to work through these layers of the society that you're in.

Alex: It took more than 10 years to get the 12. It was a lot of revolving door, a lot of damaged seekers. We had people from Reiki, Taoists, Buddhists, Tantric Buddhists, all sorts of seekers. At one stage I was so frustrated, because it's a huge effort you have to put in. One day I just said to Mother, "Please send us the true seekers that can establish in Sahaj, that can really become yogis." And then there were 10 from this group that actually established, and they became the core group of Chinese yogis which really helped to establish Sahaja Yoga. This was in the late '90s.

But prior to that, in 1995, we went to the Women's Conference in Beijing. This was a major step forward. Mother had an invitation to come and address the International Conference on Women.

Felicity: How did she get that invitation?

Alex: I think there was one yogini from the UK who had contacted the organizers and gave the bio of Shri Mataji. They said, "Yes, it would be wonderful to have some representation from India of her standing." So she was invited. It meant she had a platform and a reason to be coming to Beijing. And she knew that we could organize a program in Beijing under the umbrella of the Women's Conference, which gave us a little more leeway.

We had been doing programs in Shenzhen, just across the border, from about '94. During the Women's Conference, there was an expo in a place called Huairou, about two hours from Beijing. We found a big tent left by a telecom company, and we were able to give realisation nonstop to lots of people coming to this expo. Then Shri Mataji was arriving that weekend, so we went back to Beijing, received her at the airport, brought her to the hotel, and prepared for her visit.

This photo is her address to the UN conference. She was on a panel. If you've ever read her speech, it's a very beautiful talk. She talks about corruption and how Swiss banks have laundered people's money for so many years. She said this dirty money from African dictators goes into the "nice, clean Swiss bank." All the delegates were nodding their heads. There were a lot of delegates from Africa. This lady on the right-hand side of Shri Mataji was very much taken by her and got her realisation.

Felicity: It was a mixed international audience?

Alex: Yes, delegates from all over the world. NGOs, representatives from Africa, Europe, the Middle East, everywhere, and China as well.

Felicity: How amazing, because in one room, Mother could reach out to all the corners of the globe. Their Kundalinis must have come up, and then they go back to their own countries. An incredible opportunity.

Alex: A lot of the delegates got their realisation. And she spoke very favorably about the Chinese. She said, "I must thank the Chinese for organizing such a wonderful event. They've been very good hosts." In contrast, Hillary Clinton was the First Lady, and she came over and just started criticizing the Chinese. Mother was very upset. She said, "Such a stupid woman. What sort of person would come and insult their host?"

Felicity: It was just the East and the West clashing, isn't it?

Alex: This is shopping in Beijing. Every time Mother went anywhere, she always did some shopping. This was a handicrafts emporium. She bought some of these beautiful jade items. She loved this green; it's the color of the Nabhi, very cooling.

We bought around one metric ton of stuff that Mother had purchased in that shop. She bought handicrafts, carpets, wood carvings, jade, ceramics—so much stuff. It was a logistical challenge to get it to India, but we managed. After all the shopping was done, all of the shop assistants came and got their realisation. The manager, then one by one, all the assistants. Mother was asking, "How do you feel the cool breeze?" and they could all feel it. It was amazing.

This is the public program we did in Beijing. Shri Mataji is being presented with flowers. In her talk, she spoke about her trip down the Yangtze River, how the vibrations flow through this river and it's the Kundalini of China. She said it unfolds with beautiful scenery, like a sari. It's like a journey of the spirit, with many twists and turns, and then eventually it opens out and you see everything very clearly. She said the depth of the river reflects the depth of spirituality in China.

And this was a birthday celebration for three of the yogis. Mother said, "Oh, there's a cake," and they sang happy birthday to them.

This is the collective in Japan at the time. Shri Mataji visited Japan in '94 and '96. And this is when she was in Taiwan. She visited in 1990, '91, '94, and '96, which corresponds to her visits in China and Hong Kong. This is Shri Mataji with the Taiwan collective.

Felicity: But she never went to Korea?

Alex: Never went to Korea. There were no yogis there, nothing had been established. I went in 2009 for about a month, and it was very tough to establish. It's very right-sided, there's a lot of drinking, and a lot of hardcore Christianity. After the war, American missionaries came in and converted the Koreans from Buddhism to Christianity. If you go to Seoul at night, you'll just see neon crosses all through the city.

Here we are in Thailand. I think she went quite a few times, maybe five or six. And this is in Malaysia. She visited in '83, '90, '92, '94, '95, and '96. This was Singapore in 2007, the last time Mother came through Asia on the way to India. She wasn't speaking a lot at that time.

This is the Music of Joy tour in China, much later, in 2004-2005. Music of Joy is a group from Australia that started in the early '80s. They do beautiful arrangements of bhajans. We organized for them to come to China for an Asian tour. It was a logistical achievement; you've got about 60 people to move around with equipment. The yogis in China organized hotels, transport, flights, train tickets. We visited about eight cities: Shanghai, Beijing... every concert was absolutely packed out. In the middle of the program, we'd give them realisation, then do more bhajans to check the vibrations, then meditation, and at the end, there was dancing. A lot of joy.

Felicity: I remember when Baba Mama, Mother's brother, came and started teaching the qawwalis, bringing all this music and joy into the pujas. In the early days, pujas were just mantras and Mother's talk. Then when Music of Joy got off the ground, it was this wonderful wave of music we suddenly had access to. It was an uplifting of the spirit, a significant phase in the growth of Sahaja Yoga.

Alex: The quality of the music was really good. Shri Mataji was very happy with the arrangements and encouraged them.

This is me... these are my two daughters when they were younger. Rosie behind and Sophie in the front. This is at the program with Shri Mataji, and this is the Hong Kong collective. Mother was always very happy to see the children and would always give them lovely gifts. Rosie is now doing a lot of Sahaj music; you've probably heard her Music of Raya. Her music is beautiful, very joyful. They had an interesting upbringing, spending their holidays in Hong Kong and then at the school in Dharamshala.

The thing I used to enjoy most was that Shri Mataji was with you intensely for a few days, but it was a very intimate setting. There weren't too many people, just a small group of yogis, and you always had time to spend with her. Mother would talk to you about many things.

We tried to pamper Shri Mataji, give her a chance to relax. One of the yogis was a beautician, so we would organize a facial for her. She always enjoyed coming to Hong Kong because we never organized too many things. We'd have the public program, then shopping, and then try to give her a chance to relax. She used to love Chinese food.

Interviewer: Did she have any particular likes there?

Alex: She used to really enjoy the variety of Chinese food because it was very light. She said they don't use heavy spices, and they don't overcook things, so everything is light and crunchy. She enjoyed the fish, the pork, roasted duck, Peking duck. China has so much variety in its cuisines. Cantonese cooking is probably the lightest, with a lot of soups and steamed things. She used to enjoy the prawn dumplings. We were talking about how the Chinese can cook a meal with just a handful of sticks, heating up the wok with minimal wood. She said in India, they use so much wood because things cook for hours. She loved how the Chinese can make a delicious meal very quickly and simply.

We would always find a very good hotel, take a suite, and then decorate it. We'd take out the hotel decorations and bring in very nice Kuan Yin statues, beautiful cushions, nice furniture, carvings, and paintings to make Shri Mataji feel at home. We had fresh linen that we'd only use for her, all the dinner services, the china. We made sure her stay was perfect, with a lot of purpose and intention and love. And reciprocally, she would always be joking. We'd do bhajans together and have very intimate times with her. She would always talk to the yogis and make sure they were okay. It was a very special time.

One time, there's a very famous restaurant in Hong Kong called the Jumbo Floating Restaurant. You have to take a boat to get there. After shopping, I told all the yogis, "Let's go meet at the Jumbo restaurant." We took up a whole boat; every yogi in the collective was on that boat. I said to Shri Mataji, "Shri Mataji, we're on the same boat of spirituality!" And she laughed. "The whole of the Hong Kong collective is in this boat." She really enjoyed that.

After these wonderful times with Shri Mataji, in 1995 she did the trip to China. It took around 10 years before Sahaja Yoga really kicked off in China. The foundations were laid. There was one reporter that reported on the event we had in Beijing. After 10 years, we went and did a program there, and she came along and said, "I've been waiting 10 years for this to come back." She took her realisation again, established, and became a yogini.

We started outreaching seminars in China. We'd go to a city where there might be a handful of yogis and do an intensive workshop for a whole weekend, a full immersion of Sahaja Yoga. We'd introduce them to vibration sharing, footsoaking, candles, Havan, and a small puja. We would sponsor a small apartment for them for six months to run programs, and within that six months, it was up to them to establish and bring in more people to make it financially viable. That's how centers opened up.

There was one lady, a yoga teacher who had gone to India in the '70s and brought Hatha yoga back to China. She was very well known. She got her realisation, recognized Mother, and became a yogini. Then she gave realisation to all the students that were coming to her yoga studio. These students would go to different parts of China, start their own studios, and give realisation. That's how the collective expanded very quickly. Nowadays, we've probably got about 2,000 yogis in China, and it's growing very fast.

Interviewer: Is there any particular thing Shri Mataji told you to help you ascend, for your spiritual growth?

Alex: The main thing is you just have to be incredibly surrendered, understanding that the divine is looking after every aspect of your life. If you start thinking about it, things don't work out so well. You need dynamism, but you have to be completely open and surrendered. Who in their right mind would go to start Sahaja Yoga in a country without a job, without any idea about the culture, not knowing the language? Mother said to go, you just go. That was full faith in Mother that everything would work out.

There were trying times when you're down to your last few hundred dollars and thinking, "I've got to exit here because I can't afford to pay the rent." And I had the family back in Australia. It was challenging. That surrender you have to have is really important. Just when you think you're surrendered, Mother pushes you that little bit longer, and then you really know you weren't that surrendered until you really are. As a yogi, you go through these tests, and it helps you to become more detached. You really recognize that Mother does do everything. Things are mapped out for you, but if you're thinking about it and trying to do it yourself, it becomes an obstacle.

The more you give, the more you get. The more you put your attention on doing the divine work, the more it works out. You have to be an instrument. You have to just pray to Mother to make you a pure instrument, take away your ego, take away your superego, so that you can be in the right balance, and then things will work out.

Felicity: In your intimate times with Shri Mataji, what did she talk about?

Alex: She talked about everything. She talked a lot about the importance of handmade things. She said, "We should never lose the ability to do things and make things with our hands." That's why she wanted the school in Dharamshala, where they learn handicrafts, learn practical things with their hands, learn how to grow things.

She spoke about how important the dexterity of doing things with their hands is. It's very relevant now with artificial intelligence and all the devices we have. The focus of attention has gone to the smartphone, completely absorbed into Snapchat, Instagram—all these things that take your attention away from yourself. This is an attack on our attention. And this is what she talked about: your attention needs to be on the divine, on me. You need to channel your energy and focus so you can reap the vibrational benefit.

Everything would be a measure of vibrations. "See the vibrations from this politician? Horrible fellow." This is the awareness that we all need to develop as yogis. Shri Mataji kept reminding me of vibrational awareness. When selecting leadership, she would say, "Check the vibrations." She'd know the people in the collective by their vibrations and feel who would be good.

Mother's attention and love, you could feel that presence all the time. She said, "My attention is always with you all the time." And you could feel it so strongly. In her presence, you'd feel that incredible power of her vibrations that would just send you into another dimension, a blissful state. You didn't want it to end. The sad part was when Mother would leave. You'd be on this massive high, and then the reality would set in: we have to pack up, organize programs, do our work. But there was that magical time where time stood still, and you were just in this other dimension of blissful awareness. It just flowed so beautifully.

She spoke about how the Chinese and Indians were culturally very similar, both very traditional, old cultures with that Asian respect for each other. She said it's a shame that there are these conflicts that come up, because if they worked together, it would be great.

She would also focus a lot on the problems of the collective. She'd often come and say, "This woman, so-and-so, she's a witch," or something like that. She'd ask this woman to get out of the collective, and then the vibrations would pick up. You'd realize this person was undermining everything and creating divisions. Mother would just say, "Stupid woman, get her out." Those sorts of things would have a very profound impact on the collective because you'd feel some negativity get pulled out.

Felicity: As a yogi, if you were looking at the collective and you feel there's a problem, she said, "No, the problem is with you." She said, "I am working everything out." If you see something and it causes a reaction in you, it's your problem. You have to work out, "Why am I reacting to that?" Anything that tries to take you away from the collective, that puts an idea in your head that creates a division, it starts with little things.

Alex: That's right. Mother said you have to be very strong to be able to deal with problematic people. The problem now is that it's very hard because there's no one there to correct anybody. In a council situation, there are always differences of opinion. In the early days, Mother gave that authority to the leaders.

But as individuals, we have to introspect. We have to see if we're going off and have the humility to take advice. I was on the CC for eight years, and you realize that you can't really do much but surrender to the divine. Ultimately, that's all we can do.

We always have these characters which pop up that test you, that create the drama you need for people to evolve. Ultimately, the only reason we exist on this planet now is for our own evolution, for our own ascent. We have to remember to keep that as our primary focus and not get distracted by leadership, organizing, committees, or roles. This is just an illusion.

Sahaja Yoga has to always be foremost a spiritual movement, not an organization, not a religion. In 2008, Mother gave that speech where she said, "Everybody's responsible. You have to become your own guru." Sahaja Yoga has to be a dynamic of each individual reaching that state of higher awareness and manifesting that divinity within us. If we don't reach that state of consciousness in our lifetime, then we've failed. Collectively, it works out that if we reach that point, it'll bring everybody up and work out the world.

We are the conduits for this divine energy. We have to recognize the importance of maintaining that connection with the divine. If we don't have that connection, we're just like ordinary people. There's only that relationship with you and Shri Mataji that is the reality of this world. We have to work towards connecting and becoming integrated into that divine being. It starts with our movement. We have to manifest that cohesiveness, that collectivity, that love, that foundation that Mother's given us. We have to imbibe that and become that, otherwise, the rest of the world will fall apart. And it is all as simple as praying to Shri Mataji for doing all this for us, as an agent, just being an instrument.

Interviewer: A nice way to finish, isn't it? Thank you so much, Felicity. Thank you so much, Alex, for your time, all the way from here in England. Thank you for joining us and sharing beautiful memories, bringing alive those times which are irreplaceable and unparalleled. Thank you so much, Shri Mataji, for making this happen.

Alex: Thank you, Shri Mataji. We have to bow to Mother, absolutely, for bringing us all together and giving us such a wonderful time together.

Felicity: Listening to your wonderful times, and the other yogis who have been so honest and so willing to share their memories, it's just so joy-giving. Thank you again. Jai Shri Mataji.

All: Jai Shri Mataji.
