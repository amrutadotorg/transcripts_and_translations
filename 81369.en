Jai Shri Mataji.

Interviewer: Jai Shri Mataji. Thank you for joining us for our part two of the Golden Memories recollection, Mr. Sanjay Talwar Ji. Thank you so much, and a belated happy birthday. I believe it's a special innings that has just gone, is that right?

Sanjay Talwar: Yes, into the 70s.

Interviewer: Fantastic, fantastic, very auspicious. Now, the talk that we heard was Shri Mataji in Ganpati Pule in 1988. In our part one of the interview, that is the time, that's the occasion when you presented the Rohani Roshni tapes to Shri Mataji. Would you please continue recounting your journey? Over to you.

Sanjay Talwar: That speech brought me back to those times. Like Shri Mataji is saying, we have to feel the love and the concern for the other. And we can only do that once we are satisfied within ourselves. Once we are satisfied, it's fulfilled. And in that fulfillment, you become very creative in your expression to give the other that fulfillment. That is, I think, what I would make out from what she just said.

And that is what I think she first did with me. She fulfilled me completely, giving me all the importance that I think lacked in my life. We all have some sort of a lack that we live in, and that becomes a big problem that we call a problem of life. Something is lacking within us, and we don't know what it is. We are just groping in the dark, like every human being. But when we do Sahaja Yoga, when we are introduced to this beautiful awakening of the Kundalini, you can feel your spirit, you can feel the love in your heart. And what Mother says, she does so beautifully, touching every heart. Every person is going to feel fulfilled when she speaks. She has an immense way of reaching out to every soul. And each soul thinks that it's for them, that Mother is giving them something.

That's what I felt. And I could see that in her acharan, what you call her behavior with other people. Day to day, how she would deal with people, it was really interesting to watch her. What I felt was that she was teaching you first with so much love. And how did she give me the love? If you go back, how did I become a musician? How did I become a writer? How could I compose? How could I sing? If I look back, it was a series of miraculous incidents. Like I told you, it was Vishnu Maya whose image came to me in a physical form, in a ball of fire. It was something that you would feel, "Oh, such a great miracle." And I'm watching, and only the Adi Shakti is watching other than me. Nobody else witnessed that. But it sort of just stayed with me, just to see that it was our secret. It was her secret and my secret. Nobody there, the 45 people sitting there before her meditating, noticed it or saw it or heard it. So it was like my word to tell you that it happened. And then I went up to her, and she confirmed that yes, it was my Vishnu Maya.

And that Vishnu Maya is basically the one who announces. Shri Mataji has always spoken about Vishnu Maya, that she is the energy within you. And when she announces, you are released of all the guilt. Because when you announce the coming of the good, the golden age, what you're announcing is that you are coming now. You're becoming. And when you're becoming, then you are reaching out. Then you are showing that responsibility of what Mother does to us. She actually taught us how to be responsible and reach out to others and give them that fulfillment.

Interviewer: May I just ask you, you had mentioned Shri Mataji's behavior, the acharan and the conduct. Can you tell us more about it? What was it like? Because you were there witnessing it. A lot of us weren't there and so many won't be there. So tell us, please elaborate on those qualities, if you would.

Sanjay Talwar: Yes. We meet a lot of people in our lives; we just take it by the way. But when you meet Shri Mataji in person, then there is something very special surrounding her. And you don't even know that she is the Adi Shakti at that time, because it takes a little time for you to get to know who she is—when she talks, the way she moves, the way she touches people's lives, what she says, how she lives her life. If you can become very observant, which I became—I was lucky that way—I observed her very closely. And I found nobody mirrored her as a personality, as a mother, as a divine person.

First of all, you don't expect a human being to be divine, because you would never give that stature to any human being. But then all of a sudden, when she comes in front of you, that aura that surrounds you, and it's the vibrations that she's probably carrying around her, they just envelop you. They envelop you with all her grace, her beauty... it's just not so possible to describe. You're in a state of stillness, of heaven, of absorption. Here is a source that has come. And her Maya is so amazing that she doesn't expose herself fully. She behaves like you and me. She talks to you like any other person would talk to you. And you could get lost in that Maya. But if you had that innocence, that simpleness in you, that basic goodness about you, then you could easily pierce through the Maya and see who she is.

I think she was all the time what she was. But how did we actually see her? How did we comprehend? How are we able to visualize that beauty? It is something which is within you that reflects. And she makes you reflect. She is the source of reflection, but then you have to be a good reflector. So that comes from your inner beauty that you already are. She said that your soul, your spirit is already very pure. You're born pure, but you carried with you the baggage of your past karmas, your old life, and what you probably gathered in this life out of sheer ignorance. And here now she is to dispel that darkness, that ignorance, to come before you as that light that dawns and that surrounds and that enlightens and that gives you that vision which you never had.

And I felt that her acharan and her behavior was such that it used to attract me. It used to catch my attention that I would like to know more about her. I would like to listen to what she's saying. I'd like to follow what she's trying to tell me, because I felt here is somebody who is my benefactor. There is somebody who wants me to benefit from this relationship that she was establishing. And she was making that effort.

I could see her making it. Like when you go to a public program, people have arranged everything, and now people are waiting to see who Shri Mataji is and what she is going to speak about. They have announced that there is something wonderful that you're going to hear and experience in your life, and this is going to be a life-changing experience. And that you should be there to listen to the Mother. So you go with that blankness inside you. And yet, you're like a small scientist waiting to see what experiment is going to come for you. And if at all it is performed on me, how will I fare in it? It is like a child just discovering his life.

Though we were grown up, she gave us a second birth. She raised us for millennia. In fact, even to be in her presence, you were almost just born. And then as a child, you're groping to find out. A child just crawls and touches everything. And sometimes he touches the wrong things and can hurt himself. Sometimes he can put his hand into the fan, because he doesn't know anything. But here she has come with this whole wealth of spiritual knowledge, knowledge which is far beyond how a brain can comprehend from a normal lifestyle.

I heard her say that you're living with a limited brain. And then all of a sudden, your brain, your Sahasrara opens, and all your petals just reach out to the all-pervading power that is around you. And there is this huge brain of the divine that sort of connects with your brain. Literally, I felt that. There was some sort of a sudden opening that happened. And now I've become vast. I've become huge. I was so limited in my brain, and now it's become unlimited. And that's what she was explaining, that the power of God's love comes into your brain. And the minute it comes, you do nothing but surrender. You just let it work.

Our scientific mind should have understood this. When our body is functioning, without our knowing which organ is doing what, it works so beautifully and in the right communion with the other organs. Everything is working out so beautifully, and we don't know that. And how are we sitting on a pedestal saying, "I know, I do, I am, I am this, I am that"? No. You are what you were made out to be by her, by the creator. And she is the creator who has come down herself in the form of Shri Mataji.

It is very hard to comprehend all this. But then, in her maya, in her acharan, in her behavior, she came in front of you like yourself, like a human being. But you're suddenly so bowed over to her. All of a sudden, the seeker in you is actually now behaving himself. You're not yourself anymore. It's the seeker that has all of a sudden become a scientist. And now he's exploring, he's meditating, he's finding out. And then all these roots are growing in the brain, and all the chakras are getting nourished. And then you become silent. You become still. And then you become magnanimous, like the spirit. And then she says, "You have to give." So, all this I experienced in my early years. It is amazing. I can relate it today.

But how did I notice this? After this experience of the Vishnumaya, it was amazing. A ball of fire coming from just a concrete wall and then vanishing into the other side of the wall. And what relevance it has in my life, if you look ahead at the years that went by... Shri Mataji, of course, declared that she wanted me to be a musician, to be a writer, to be a composer. But I was none of that. I was just writing some sort of vague, funny poetry, and I used to sing film songs. I'm very fond. I remember at my sister's wedding, my brother, my sister, my parents—we were known as the singing family. We used to sing so many songs there, and Shri Mataji was watching us sing.

And when that episode happened in Jaipur, she asked me to take her to Rajasthan, as I had to buy things for her house in Rajasthan. I was just like, "Yes, Shri Mataji." She said, "I want you to drive me." Out of the blue, she asked me to drive her. There was no plan. How is she going to go with me in a small Fiat car? Mind you, those days, there were only Fiats and Ambassadors. Mercedes were for the very, very rich people in India; there weren't many other options. And then you had people like Rajesh Shah, who would bring a Mercedes from Bombay to make the Adi Shakti comfortable. She has to go very comfortably; she's the divine mother after all. And it was all well understood that there was a car standing there to take her. A driver was supposed to be on duty. But then, what other drama she played, Shri Mahamaya! Isn't it? How she engineered the whole situation so she could bring you up to that level that she wanted.

And then when we were driving, she was asking me to just sing. While I'm singing, her hand is on my back, massaging me on my chakras, massaging me on my Vishuddhi. At that moment, I didn't even realize what was happening. I thought she was being very kind to me because I was going to drive so long, that she was just giving me a massage on the neck. "How are you feeling?" I said, "Yes, Mother, I'm feeling very nice, but I don't have much pain." And she's saying, "You just don't worry. You keep singing."

Then I could see that while she was doing that, something was happening within me. And that trip actually made me create 18 songs in three days. And she was prompting me, the way I explained last time, how the words came out and some miracles happened en route.

Interviewer: Yes, you shared with us how she dictated the words to the song as well.

Sanjay Talwar: Yes. Like I was singing, and in the middle of that, she stopped me and said, "Why don't you think of me when you're singing?" Most of the songs were meant for a lover; either he's a jilted lover and then he's just wanting to praise his paramour. And she basically said, "Think of the Devi. Think of me." The minute you put your attention on her, the words have to change. And then she's prompting me with the words. Fortunately, my wife was in the backseat and she was having a dictaphone. We sort of prepared that something unusually great was going to happen, and she put on the dictaphone. She trapped her voice on the dictaphone, so it was easy for us to listen to it later.

Interviewer: Do you still have it?

Sanjay Talwar: I just found one of the tapes of my dictaphone, and I don't know whether it's working because dictaphones don't work. I have probably thrown my dictaphone. I'll have to look for how to run those small tapes. Maybe it's there. We had her on record.

During the journey, when we were making the songs, she said, "This is the beginning of music in Sahaja Yoga. And I want you to sing all these bhajans for me in your public programs." It started with the 1986 Jaipur public program, the ones that I created during the journey. She was very excited about it and she gave me a lot of examples about how this bhajan would work with the public.

I remember there was a bhajan where Shri Mataji was saying that people generally come and they are so restless. "I need somebody to hold them." And then my dad had just entered and used to speak a lot, so she was telling him to give a speech. And when he was speaking... you're not so great a speaker in the very beginning of your career in Sahaj. But because he had a very aggressive way of talking, he would get people's attention to listen to his voice. That was the quality my dad had. But she placed me there to sing alongside. So when he would stop for a while, I had to do a bhajan. And that bhajan had just been created by her, and she had planted it for that public program so that I could sing. It was a film song, and as you mentioned, she flipped the words. She said, "No, people get up and they go. They don't wait. They're thinking all the time, and they just walk out. So there are people walking in, walking out in my public program, but that gets very disturbing to the others." These are the little things she was so concerned about in the early public programs.

And that's when I sang this song. I could literally see people who had walked away were coming back to sit down.

Interviewer: Could you sing that for us, please?

Sanjay Talwar: Okay. I'll give you the words she gave in one of those songs.

Interviewer: The version that Shri Mataji gave.

Sanjay Talwar: Yes. So the original song was... (Sings original melody). So I'm singing, and then she said... (sings Shri Mataji's version)
Just these words, when I sang, people came back because it was a very popular Hindi song and the words had been changed. People were just wondering, "What is he trying to say?" And just in that wonderment, many people walked back and sat down. When Mother came, she saw a full house. People had not walked out. And I realized what magic she had done through this song. First, she chooses me as an instrument. Then she plants the poet in me. Then she makes me sing a song. Then she puts the words in the song. And then she controls the entire public program through me. There I realized, she was making me an instrument. And as long as I can feel that this instrument is hollow, it will play her tune.

So, soon after, in 1987, I wrote and composed a song myself. And this composition also happened in front of her. This is where Vishnumaya was working. The announcement part had started. And it started with Saraswati within me getting awakened, through my Swadhishthana, and joining hands with Durga, with the left heart deity within us, Parvati, and the Radha of the Krishna. They are all so interconnected. And then she showed me how they are all related to each other. And she said, "Now what comes out from your vocals is just vibrations. And when you sing that, people just get vibrations." They get into meditation.

Interviewer: Did you notice a change in your voice when Shri Mataji worked on you? Let's say, in Sahaj terms, when she was charging your shoulders and your neck.

Sanjay Talwar: She worked very subtly. More so, at that time, how to write poems and how to write things which could be sung in public programs, they started working. Then she had triggered somewhere in my Vishuddhi that when I started singing, my voice started becoming sweet. I wasn't having a very sweet voice earlier, and I noticed it. In fact, when I went back after that Rajasthan trip and I was singing at home, everybody was commending. They said, "We have not heard this kind of voice that you have."

Then came the real trigger, when the voice really opened. It was 1987, in Shivratri Puja in Bombay. And there, in the Puja itself, I was writing a song. And that song was about the life of a flute. That the Kundalini is the breath that you blow through me. My chakras are like those holes in the flute. And then, when your fingers run over it, your tune is playing through me. I am so hollow.

That is the poem. The poem is: Tere saanson ki jab ek ladi, Sukhman meri ko bhar degi. Sukhman is your Sushumna, and saanson ki ek ladi is your Kundalini. It's just that one sutra that rises. We used to talk about it, that don't think that all your Kundalini rope is being awakened. Just one thread is coming in, and that is giving you self-realization. So, you're feeling all that because of just one thread of Kundalini. Imagine if you were to grow it in your depth, and all your chakras get aligned, and you are totally surrendered and in the stillness. How many threads of Kundalini will automatically get attracted to come up to your Sahasrara where your Mother is sitting? It wants to come up. It's dying to come up. Are you allowing it? Are you clearing your chakras?

Because it's a natural process of the Kundalini that it has to rise against gravity. The two and a half feet distance the Kundalini has to cover from the base of the spine to the fontanelle is literally sucked in through this autonomous nervous system, which is auto. It works on its own. Nobody engineers anything. You surrender, and automatically, it's sucked up. And the minute it crosses your brain, it makes you thoughtless. And the minute it crosses your Sahasrara, you become doubtless. That means you are there.

So, this poem said that: Sukhman meri ko bhar degi, tab deh mera, Bansuri bane. Then my system, my subtle system, becomes like a flute. Tab deh mera, Bansuri bane, sab raag madhur swar me baje. Now you play through your fingers this flute on my chakras, and whatever comes out from me, my voice from my singing, is your music. Your raga of love. So, whatever flows out is nothing but pure vibrations. And then Shri Mataji said, "Once you have become an instrument to give your songs, your music, to the world outside, you see the kind of benevolent work that is happening through you. Because people are getting those vibrations, they are going deeper into their meditation, and they are understanding that there is nothing much to be known except surrender." Surrender yourself to the higher power.

Interviewer: Very nice. It's so beautiful, such a lovely song of surrender, of love for the divine, for Shri Mataji, and how it manifested. Moving on from here, how did you keep that state of a humble, hollow flute in yourself? And what was life like then for you? What were the further encounters or meetings with Shri Mataji like? Because we can see the change from when you first met Shri Mataji at your sister's wedding proposal, to the journey in Rajasthan, to here at Mahashivratri Puja where you composed this song. How did things evolve from there for you?

Sanjay Talwar: There was a path-breaking thing that happened when I went to show her that poetry. Because I had just written it; she hadn't heard it until I did. When I went to her, it was past midnight. She was just relaxing after her puja and having dinner. And after dinner, she was having a chat with these world leaders; they all used to come at that time where she was staying. I was staying at some other Sahaja Yogi's house. I had written the poetry, and I was getting very fidgety. I wanted to show this to Shri Mataji. He said, "Well, she just came out of the puja, now you can't disturb her." There were these protocols which were known to all of us. But somehow, within me, there was this urge that I have to... that Shri Mataji wants to hear this. She's waiting for me. I said, "She's waiting for me." He first thought I was crazy, but then he said, "Okay, I'll take you."

And then we both went to her; we knew where she was staying. The minute I went there... I'll tell you, this incident is like a big miracle that happened. The doors were ajar. It was two o'clock in the morning, and we walked through the doors where she was staying, in a Juhu villa that Mr. Rahul Bajaj, I think, owns. He was giving that place for her to stay on the puja day. When we entered the villa, Shri Mataji was sitting at the head of the dining table. We were just walking through the gate, going through, and I could see Shri Mataji from a far distance. And then I could hear her, while we were walking towards her, she was saying... (speaks in Hindi) which means, "Come, come, I was waiting for you." And then this Sahaja Yogi with me said, "Wow, this guy was already telling me that Mother is waiting for him, and why was I not listening to him?" So, this was like I was just connected to her somehow at that moment.

And then something great was supposed to happen. What really happened was that when I came next to her, after I bowed down at her feet—we both went totally flat down—she said, "Come, sit next to me." She was sitting at the dining table. She had just finished her dinner and was washing her hands in the finger bowl and wiping her hands. When I came, she said, "You come sit next to me." They used to keep one seat vacant next to Shri Mataji, and nobody would sit absolutely next to her. There were others all surrounding her. Sir CP was also sitting, and Rajesh Shah was sitting, other world leaders were sitting. And she said, "No, no, you come sit next to me here." So I sat down next to her. I held my ears, and she says, "It's okay, just relax. Now, you tell me, what have you brought?"

So I started to take out that paper and read it out. The minute I started reading, she said, "Stop. No reading. Sing it." And that was a shock. I had not composed it at all. It was just a poem. I had just written something, and I wanted to read it out. So I just looked at Shri Mataji and said, "But Shri Mataji..." She said, "Just sing it." She didn't even give me a chance to rebut what she was saying. And I just said, "Jai Shri Mataji," closed my eyes. And then she moved that finger bowl towards me. She said, "First, drink this." So I drank from that finger bowl that she had just finished washing her hands in after dinner. I just gulped it down. And I knew what it smelled like... it was like when you're washing her feet, you get the smell of the ittar and the roses. And you can feel that there was this elixir flowing. It can't be described. Like when you're washing her feet with honey and so many things, and then all this becomes such a beautiful thing that people are offered. It was something like that. I had that whole thing in the finger bowl.

The minute it went into my system, I felt at that moment the same thing I had felt in that car, when I was suddenly among the stars and the planets and the moon. I was somewhere, floating in the atmosphere. I was like the soul, and it felt like I was in the comfort of the arms of the almighty. I felt so comfortable there. And then from very far off, I could hear Shri Mataji's voice saying, "Come sing, sing, sing." And then it's coming closer, closer, closer, and then I'm back into my body. It was like that experience I had. And I just burst into a song. I don't know what I sang.

After I finished singing the whole song, everybody in that room was clapping. And Shri Mataji said, "See, this is the Raga of the Sahasrara that you have composed." And I didn't even know. She asked somebody, "Which Raga is it?" Somebody commented, "Mother, it is Raga Darbari." And that's when I first time came to know that Raga Darbari was actually flowing through me, and it is the Raga of the Sahasrara. At that time, she declared, "I am going to take him all over the world to spread his music and his vibrations from his bhajans." And that is where Nirmal Sangeet Sarita was officially appointed by Shri Mataji to accompany me overseas for the public programs.

She met old Baba Mama immediately, and she said, "Baba, I have a singer here. I want you to bring all the musicians, and they have to perform along with him. And then we will take this music group all over the world." And from there, our journey of Nirmal Sangeet Sarita also started, from 1988. That was my first trip overseas, and my first Guru Puja overseas in Andorra.

Interviewer: Oh, yes. Before we get there, would you remember the song, and can you please sing a bit of it for us? This one?

Sanjay Talwar: Okay.
(Sings the bhajan "Tere saanson ki jab ek ladi...")
Thank you. Thank you.

Interviewer: Wow. Most beautiful.

Sanjay Talwar: So, this song was recorded in Rohani Roshni, and it was Mother's favorite song. Then she said, when you record your next album... of course, I had done two albums in December 1986. This was called Adi Shakti Pujan 1 and Adi Shakti Pujan 2. She asked me to bring them to Ganpati Pule, and they were very popular there. In fact, both those cassettes used to play in Malvan village, in all the shops. So if you were walking from MTDC to Malvan village to attend her seminar or her program, all the shops were playing my songs. And it was so funny for me, because when I was walking, I was hearing my voice in some shop, because the cassettes had gone all over Malvan. That was the first time the cassettes were ever brought into Malvan village.

And Mother had put me in charge. She said, "Go sit there, and you distribute them." At one point, when I started to distribute them for free, and she came to know, she said, "What are you doing? Aren't you going to recover the cost of your recording? Aren't you going to cover the cost of these cassettes? Please, put a price to it." And you won't believe it, she priced those cassettes at 50 rupees. In that time, 1986. And I do remember, 600 cassettes had been brought there, and they were all gone within one hour. Because she announced, "He has come up with this cassette, and everybody must buy it." There were people like, "Oh, can't I get it for free?" And she said, "No, if you don't buy, your Nabhi will not open." This is how Shri Mataji used to direct everything herself.

When I was doing Rohani Roshni, she wanted me to do a very professional recording in Bombay. She said, "No, don't go where you went last time. Now you go to a very professional studio." And that is the time I got Kavita Krishnamurthy, the great playback singer, to sing for me. And Shri Mataji monitored Rohani Roshni's entire recording herself, from the phone into the studio.

Interviewer: Please, can you describe the whole process for us? What was this breaking the coconut, the whole process that you just mentioned? Could you give the details, please?

Sanjay Talwar: Yes. Shri Mataji said that this is what you should do. You should go to the studio, because musicians who perform before me, they immediately go into that state. I put them in that state. So when they are performing in front of me, they are actually using music to transfer vibrations to everybody who's watching, who's listening. That was one way she used to have music all night in Ganpati Pule. But the musicians were from outside, mostly. She was gearing up people like me to become musicians, the Sahaja Yogis to become musicians, so you don't need outside people at all.

So when she said you go for a studio recording, she said that they are all professionals. They all work for money; they were charging for their time. But she said, "At that moment when you are recording these songs, I want the vibrations there. And those vibrations will be intact in the recording. So when everybody listens to the recording, they will get the vibrations." So, how to create those vibrations so that the musicians are playing within the ambit of what Shri Mataji wanted? She said, "You have to break a coconut before you start." Like when Mother used to arrive, before she would put her feet on the ground, we used to break a coconut. And then we used to lay those red carpets for her, whether we were putting our shawls or our most expensive clothes where Shri Mataji would put her feet. She had taught me that concept in 1985-86.

Same thing she taught me in the studio. When you go for the recording, you have to do my agaman—means, I am coming. And when you do that agaman in your heart, you break the coconut, you take the bandhans, you say the three mantras. Then she told me to take the 108 names, openly. Everybody was joining us. We did a very small, quick puja with the 108 names. And then we sat for 5-10 minutes, and we said that we are now engulfed in the vibrations for this task of Rohani Roshni, and may Shri Mataji bless us all in our hearts to play what she wants us to play. May all the vibrations get encased into that recording. That's how she taught me how to record that album.

And when I was doing it, she was monitoring it on the phone through Mr. Pradhan, Dr. Ashish Pradhan's father. He was the one I was coordinating with when it came to Shri Mataji calling up at the studio. She would say, "Now is the right time, you start." Shri Mataji was so interested to know how Rohani Roshni was getting recorded. I remember, after each song, I would go to her and play it for her, and she would tell me if anything had gone wrong, to go back to the studio and correct it. That's how we got Kavita Krishnamurthy to take her self-realization, and that's how Shri Mataji gave all her blessings to Kavita.

Do you know that Kavita Krishnamurthy is one of the most anointed playback singers of India? At that time, she was nobody. She is a very famous Bollywood singer, very nice, touching voice, melodious. She was like a melody queen. Shri Mataji said that she's such a great singer that one day she will rise. And because she's recording in your cassette, she will get this rise very fast. She said that. And then I told Kavita that Shri Mataji is blessing you. She was so happy. She didn't only do Rohani Roshni; she did another cassette with me, Sahaj Sadhana. She did three volumes of Kabir with me. This story of music goes on and on for years. We made 20 albums in those times.

Interviewer: Is she a practicing Sahaja Yogi now?

Sanjay Talwar: Well, she said that this has to come from within you, the seeking. You could be a good person, you may participate in a Sahaj program, you may create vibrations through your music. A musician is a born divine personality, because music in itself is a surrender to God. And all the ragas and all the seven notes are related to seven chakras. Shri Mataji brought music to amalgamate with our realization. But it didn't literally pick up so much.

So, this was one miracle, which I told you, how my voice suddenly became so silky when I was singing. And I couldn't believe it. She said, "Can you believe what you're singing?" I said, "No, Mother, I don't think this is my voice." Then in 1988, she took me overseas, and I became very popular with my bhajans. Everything was so lovely. A guy who never got attention in his life was getting so much attention, so many claps, so much love from everybody. What could I ask for? This was a miracle, wasn't it? In a short lifetime.

Interviewer: Immense. Yes, words aren't adequate to describe it. When is this, "Sitting in the Heart"? Because it came out in our conversation, and we've been in England for a good quarter of a century nearly now. But I didn't know that you wrote that song with Mother. Could you please tell us about it? When, where, how did it come about?

Sanjay Talwar: In fact, your questions seem to be chronologically shifting to the next thing. In 1989, I was in London with my tour with Shri Mataji and our Nirmal Sangeet Sarita. After one of our performances in Brighton, I think, Shri Mataji had a public program there. She hired a van for us to be taken to Shudy Camps. We left for Shudy Camps around 11:30 at night. And sharp at 12, after half an hour of driving, I started talking to Paddy and Herbert, saying, "I think it's about time we wrote something in English." And they said, "Yes."

I used to keep a diary with me and a pen, and I started writing. As I would write a line or two, I would talk to them and say, "This is coming to me." They would say, "Wow, this needs to be developed further." Sometimes they were suggesting a few words here and there, and I kept writing. By the end of maybe a couple of minutes, the whole song was written: "Sitting in the Heart of the Universe." And I'm telling them, "Mother says that London, England, is the heart of the universe. So let's dedicate this song to the UK." And I also said at that time that the UK is like my second home. That's where my heart is today.

When I wrote this song, we were trying to hum a tune in the van. And they were so excited, because Herbert has a guitar. He was almost jumping out of the van, saying, "When are we going to reach? Let's go, we're going to play it for Shri Mataji." I said, "No, no, it's past 1 a.m. in the morning. We should all sleep over it." By the time we got out at Shudy Camps, we went into the main entrance where Shri Mataji was, and we were supposed to go to our respective places and spend the night. The next day was supposed to be a music program before Krishna Puja, which was organized in Shudy Camps in 1989. So we all had to be ready and prepare.

But this song was ready. We were so excited. As we entered a room, there were about 15-16 Sahaja Yogis from different countries playing the guitar. And we said, "What are you doing at 1:30 in the morning?" They said, "We are practicing for tomorrow's music program." So then Herbert said, "All of you, just hold on for a second. Let's string towards what has just been written." That is where the tune actually materialized. They were all there, 15-16 of them. In fact, 16 of them, I would say, were the 16 kalas of Lord Krishna. There were 16 people on the guitar, and we were humming, "Sitting in the heart of the universe, we know your love is flowing through us."

Interviewer: Please sing it.

Sanjay Talwar: (Sings)
Sitting in the heart of the universe,
We know your love is flowing through us.
Shri Mataji, we love you.
Shri Mataji, we love you.

So that's how it just happened, so fast, so good. And everybody was so excited. They said, "Oh, we must play this to Shri Mataji." Of course, we couldn't disturb her. But the next morning, he was so charged. I went up to her and asked if I would like to present one small song which was composed last night. And Shri Mataji said, "Yes, you can do that in the evening program." She never heard it at that time. She didn't ask me to play it. And that kept the excitement still more, because you knew that Shri Mataji knew what you had done. She is the all-knower. You don't have to go and make all this drama of showing her things. She always used to know beforehand everything you've done.

And then she called Sir C.P. and said, "Sanjay has created this song for the UK. And now he's going to play." That is the time they all sat with me with the guitar, and we sang to Shri Mataji. It was sung in that music program before we had the Krishna puja the next day.

Interviewer: Amazing. That is so beautiful. We will hopefully find the link in amruta.org for the evening program and put it with your talk so everyone can enjoy this beautiful song that we sing here in the UK pretty often. It's so full of love.

Sanjay Talwar: If you get that link, send it to me, because I have never heard that recording from Shudy Camps. But yes, it has been sung several times on YouTube by me. The latest one is when I recorded this in my next album, called Sahaj Sadhana, which was in 1990. It was composed in '89 and recorded immediately in '90 with Kavita Krishnamurthy again.

Interviewer: There was another phase, as you mentioned Sadhana Sargam, I remember at least two more famous playback singers from the film industry had performed for Shri Mataji. Is that right?

Sanjay Talwar: Yes. Sadhana Sargam joined me in my Kabir albums, and she also rose to big heights after she recorded. Another one was Shubha Mudgal. She also rose to great heights after she recorded just one song for me, written by my mother for the album Jagruti in 1992. Then there was Ustad Amjad Ali Khan; he had performed for Shri Mataji in Cabella, I think, and then his fame also took off. The blessings of Shri Mataji were so abundant.

I know one more great singer called Anup Jalota. He's from Lucknow, I'm told. In 1982, Shri Mataji went by ship to America for the first time, and he was in that ship with his father. He was a young teenager, and he shot up to great fame after that trip. Shri Mataji took a liking for him when she heard him in somebody's house. His father was singing, and he was also singing along. And Shri Mataji said, "I would like you to come to America." They said, "Mother, we have nothing to take us there." And Sir C.P. arranged their travel in the same ship as Shri Mataji. Anup Jalota and his father were both transported to the US where they met the Indian diaspora. The Indian diaspora literally adopted him. Shri Mataji even came back without him, and he became so popular with his bhajans. He remembers it all. That was 1982.

Interviewer: My parents were big fans of his "Tumak Chalat Ramachandra." We'd hear that practically every morning. It is beautiful how Shri Mataji just showers her love on all of us.

Sanjay Talwar: It is. But getting a musician to become a Sahaja Yogi is a very daunting task, because he becomes a temporary Sahaja Yogi. The depth has not been touched by many. You can see there are a lot of things going on in different countries, how people are taking to Sahaja Yoga, and what kind of acharan, behavior they should have had, what Mother talks about being a real Sahaja Yogi. But in those times, I could see that very clearly, and Mother used to show us. She says you really have to have that in you to get this great experience, which is not everybody's cup of tea. It is only for those who deserve it.

We try and give Sahaja Yoga to everyone. It's good that you feel good and you want everybody to know, but you should leave it at that. Because it's their inner desire, their karma, their Prarabdha Karma has to be so good that now is the time for you to get your self-realization. They have to be ready for it. Even a seeker is a person of a great mettle that he actually becomes a Sahaja Yogi. Otherwise, there are many who are just there for different reasons. They are not really going deeper into meditation. Because if they were, they would be just that one. There would be no other. This duality still exists in our Sahaja Yogis, unfortunately, and many of them practicing for years and decades haven't gotten there. It's sad.

Interviewer: It is sad. And we know of people who have been close to Shri Mataji and yet have lost the way, in a physical and spiritual sense. There is, even now, what Shri Mataji has called "guru shopping" going on. But that's not for us to dwell on. That's for Shri Mataji to take care of. Tell us, what are the things that you would suggest to the seekers of tomorrow, to the Yogis of today? The words of wisdom that you gleaned from Shri Mataji that helped you to touch that depth, that silence, and to have that power.

Sanjay Talwar: I would say that do what you feel very happy to do, firstly, because you are at freedom to do what you want. But one thing is there: if you are born in this world, you must look for that purpose. And for the larger purpose of living a happy, healthy, satisfied, and a spiritually uplifting existence should be your main goal. I would like you to think that if you have taken the step of taking your self-realization, you know about Shri Mataji, you know what she's talking about, please stick to listening to her tapes. Only that. Please do not follow what others do. Follow what your heart is actually believing. Believe in yourself. Believe that you are the guru, that you are the one who's seeking, and that you are the one who's going to be getting everything.

Once you have everything inside you, what are you seeking outside? We are seeking happiness, good health, perfect relationships with our families and outside. We are seeking good jobs, a good house—everything material that satisfies this human body at a gross level. Please, look within and seek beyond the non-material self in you that is your spirit. Seek the comfort of yourself. And how does that come? It's when Mother tells you to do Sahaja Yoga meditation ardently, by becoming thoughtless and getting into a state of doubtlessness. Because the moment all your questions finish, your depth starts. The more you meditate, the more vibrations you feel, the more deeper you get into Sahaja Yoga, the more beautiful this world will become. The more loving, the more affectionate, the more magnanimous. A very helping personality. You become, like my Mother said in her speech just now, benevolent. You start giving out to the world. You become a source of all what you are seeking for yourself.

There is no dearth of people you can give this to. There is a huge life to live by giving this love, by becoming love, by feeling it, by embracing, by becoming one. So, don't fight, don't say bad words, just join everybody. Make a huge family, because she said if we do this all individually, we can become collective. This is a collective force that is going to change the world. It's not just you and me alone; it is us all being one. So if we start fighting with each other, if we start pulling each other down... see, when we came to Sahaja Yoga, we were all full of mistakes. Shri Mataji bore us. So what do you need to do? You have to have patience. Have patience with yourself and patience with others. Don't lose your anger, don't lose your patience. Be very magnanimous. Start giving. I don't know, I can't say more than this. Please, be a real Sahaja Yogi.

Interviewer: That's really putting it succinctly. Share with us any other miracles you would like to. We're living in times which are, on the worldly level, full of unrest and calamities. Peace is threatened in so many parts of the world, and yet we have Shri Mataji and her blessings, and the peace that she grants us. Share with us some other inspiring moments, please, that you spent with her.

Sanjay Talwar: Sister, we'll have to do this the next time. I would have loved to share more, but I think I now have certain obligations to get back to. I'll keep this in mind, and we'll come back again and talk about this. This is a very deep subject and needs a proper way to handle it. I'd love to do that again and come back afresh to you, if that would be okay.

Interviewer: Yes, that's fine. Thank you so much. Thank you very much for joining us today for this session and sharing your amazing times with Shri Adi Shakti, Shri Mataji. Thank you so much.
