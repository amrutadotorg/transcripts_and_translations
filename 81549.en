I went to college in London from the North East because London was the city paved with gold. I went down with a couple of guys from school, and we got digs in Stratford in East London. We went there the Friday before we were due to start college on the Monday. We walked to college all mob-handed over the sewer bank—I mean, how romantic. It was a big path over huge sewer pipes running the length of East London. It was very salubrious.

And there, I saw Maureen and fell in love at first sight. I knew I would marry her just then.

We started going to college and shared some lectures. Because we'd gone together, my two pals and I always used to sit together. Then one day, the guys were a little bit late, and Maureen sat beside me. This was horrific to the other guys, really shocking. This was in 1979.

Very soon after we started college, she started meetings on campus, and I started going to them. It was because of Maureen, but I was fascinated by her. Then, quite early on in our relationship, she said, "I don't want boyfriends, anything like that. I want to save the world." Which either makes you very, very intrigued or run away fast. Luckily, I was very intrigued by this and started going to Maureen's meetings in college, where we had a massive response of two or three people.

Then Maureen said, "You should come and meet her." I was fascinated to meet this person, and it was on a Monday evening in Caxton Hall. At that time—and this sort of shocks the Sahaja Yogis that we meet now—Mother used to do Caxton Hall meetings every Monday, as regularly as possible. Quite often afterward, we would go to the Tabernacle, the Italian restaurant near Victoria Station, and Mother would be there eating as well. Or sometimes, we'd be invited back to Mother's flat at Ashley Gardens, beside the Catholic Cathedral, and Mother would send out for McDonald's. Mother would have a Fillet-O-Fish.

When I met her, Mother told me later I was born realized, so what I felt from meditating was not dramatic. It wasn't a big thing, but it fell into place when I saw her. I was sat at the front of Caxton Hall, and Mother walked in. It was like she wasn't walking or floating; she was walking like a normal human being, but she sort of almost ghosted in. Very smooth, very non-dramatic, but very awesome, very immense. Everything was full of her presence. I can't remember at all what she spoke about.

When she finished her lecture, everyone had been given their realisation. Everyone was asking, "Who's got it? Did you feel that?" I had felt it beforehand at the meetings, but when Mother was there, it just felt like coming home. Because of what she said to me later, everything fell into place. I had almost felt a little bit like an outsider, and I wasn't really a seeker, but I knew there was something far more important than the run-of-the-mill life that everyone seemed to lead.

I'd been brought up a Catholic and sort of subscribed to it. I was an altar boy for years and years, way longer than you should be—until I was 17. The parish priest was a friend of the family; he'd grown up with my dad and his brother, so we knew the guy anyway. And it just wasn't right. I knew him quite well—he used to play football with us at the parish—but it just wasn't right.
