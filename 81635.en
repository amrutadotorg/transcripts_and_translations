 (England)
Good evening, everyone. I'm Christine Hage. I was born in France to Polish parents, so I have stories about France and about Poland. I'm living happily in Vienna, Austria, because Shri Mataji gave me a lovely, strong, Austrian husband.

During my first India tour in '85-'86, we were in Rahuri. I heard the Mahalakshmi Stotram for the first time. I don't remember if it was a music program or during a puja, but when I heard this song for the first time, I was so moved. I was blasted, and I started to cry and cry. In myself, I said, "But why are you crying? Shri Mataji is here, and you are crying." I looked at Shri Mataji, and she was crying too. At the end of the song, she said, "You see, it doesn't matter if you are singing or if you are listening. When you feel the Spirit, we are one."

For this session with stories, it also doesn't matter who speaks or who listens. These stories are so fascinating because they show the divine play of Shri Mataji for each one of us. And we are thousands. She created a story for each one of us to learn something about ourselves, to go deeper in spirituality, and with such love, such care, and such humor also. Only the divine can manage such a show.

I met Shri Mataji for the first time in August '82 in Lausanne, Switzerland. I saw a poster of Shri Mataji. It was not the motherly face on this poster; it was the guru face. I looked at her, and I said, "Oh, I know her. She's strict, but I need someone strict to make order in my life." And I went to the program.

I observed everyone who was there, and I saw at this time Marie Martin was pregnant. I said to myself, "Oh, we can also get children when we do this yoga." Shri Mataji came a little bit later, maybe 30 or 45 minutes. She came in, walking majestically in her white sari. Suddenly, a couple of Swiss people stood up and showed her their watch because she was too late—and we were in Switzerland. Shri Mataji just went on and said, "For God, there is no time." Just to hear this, I said, "She's the right one. She's sent by God."

After, during the realization, I felt such strong vibrations. This confirmed what I was looking for all the time, even when I was a child. My name, Christine, has Christ inside. And I was born on Pentecost. I knew I would once feel the Holy Ghost on my head, like the apostles. And this was the time.

Shri Mataji left the hall, but I stayed. I was alone. I couldn't go away. And suddenly, she was near me. She took my hands and said, "Did you feel it?" I could just answer, "Yes." I felt... I cannot describe what I felt, but it was like an energy, something that she gave me.

So I came back to Mulhouse, to France. I gave realization to some friends and some relatives, and we were a little group, meeting every week to meditate with the help of the Swiss yogis. In Easter of '83, my friend Martine and I, who were both teaching, had holidays, so we went to the ashram in Le Raincy. For the first time, I entered a meditation room, and this was also overwhelming, to see all these pictures of Mother. I remember I just sat down and told Shri Mataji, "Please come to my town, also, to give realization to so many seekers there."

In June '83, five of us ladies from the province, from Mulhouse, went to Paris where Shri Mataji was giving programs. When we were at the airport, Shri Mataji came. From our group of five, I was the only one who had seen Shri Mataji physically; the others had only seen her in pictures. One told me she was expecting a princess or a queen to come. But Shri Mataji arrived just with a coat and a scarf on her head, like a normal lady. When she saw us, she said, "Why are you looking so serious, all of you? Thinking about your catches, about your problems. Are you not happy to see your mother?" And she left.

We didn't know where she was going, to Marie's flat or to the ashram, so we decided to go to the ashram. We just knew the direction, Le Raincy, but we had no address. We went to the area and suddenly saw a house with a lot of shoes outside. So we said, "Okay, it must be there." We entered the house, and there were not a lot of yogis, maybe ten, and Shri Mataji was sitting in her armchair. The leader at this time said, "Come, come, come." I came in front of Shri Mataji and did namaste. He said, "Shri Mataji, this is Christine from Mulhouse." And she said, "But I know her." She gestured to me to come to her. She took me, she embraced me, and she said, "You are meeting again after 2,000 years." She confirmed what I was already feeling as a child, that I was living in the time of Christ.

At the evening program, at the end, she asked the yogis to come to the front to help her work on the new people. We from the province didn't know how to work on someone; we didn't want to do something wrong, so we stayed completely behind in the hall. We had such vibrations coming out of us. All five of us ladies were feeling a little bit guilty that we couldn't help Shri Mataji. But I tell you, we were just in thoughtless awareness at this moment. We were just looking at her, so happy to see her.

Shri Mataji finished her session and left the hall. But when she passed near us, the little group of the five ladies, she stopped. She did namaste and said, "Thank you very much. You helped me this evening. Thank you very much." This is pure Zen: action in inaction.

That was in June. Our first puja in a foreign country was in England, Guru Puja in Lodge Hill on the 24th of July. Oh, wait. I forgot to tell you that when I was in the ashram in Switzerland, I meditated and asked Shri Mataji to come to our place. After this, when I came out of the meditation room, Arnaud, the leader at the time, told me, "You see, Christine, Shri Mataji's tour is already planned. But write an invitation to her. It might be that she's coming to Mulhouse." So with Martine and with our poor English, we wrote a little letter just to thank Shri Mataji for giving us realization, that now we knew the meaning of the words love and friendship, and that we would like her to come to give realization to the seekers of our place.

And in Lodge Hill, on the 24th of July—which was Saint Christine's, my name's day—Arnaud came to me and said, "Christine, Shri Mataji is coming to Mulhouse."

She came on the 1st of September, my sister's birthday. I mean, these details, these coincidences. First, we were in Switzerland for the Krishna Puja. We were not a lot, maybe 20 or 25 people, in the garden of the ashram. Martine and I left quickly to go to Mulhouse to prepare my flat for Shri Mataji's coming. In my bedroom, there was a cupboard, and on this cupboard, there were so many spots. I wanted to get rid of these spots, to clean them. I took chemical things to clean, but nothing went away. After some time, I said, "Okay, I give up." I just took a little cloth for a last chance to wipe away the dust, and suddenly all the spots disappeared by themselves.

In the same moment, Martine was in the kitchen cleaning the candle holders, and she shouted, "Christine, what is happening? The candle holders are cleaning by themselves!" Later on, we were told that the Ganas and the deities were already in the place to help us prepare for Shri Mataji's coming.

Shri Mataji came from Basel to Mulhouse by train. We had organized a comfortable armchair that we rented and put some saris on. But we completely forgot to prepare a table for her food when she was eating. Can you imagine, Shri Mataji had her warm plate on her lap to eat because there was no table? Warren, who was with Shri Mataji, was so cross with Martine and me. How could we dare not to think about this? It was really tough.

We got a little bit of a fright, so I went to my neighbor to get a table. I came back with a little table, and when Shri Mataji saw it, she said, "No, no, no, no. I don't need any table. I'm completely satisfied. You see, I could have eaten in the train, but I said no, I want to eat in Mulhouse." This delicacy of hers, not to hurt us. And also, she was asking my permission to use my telephone to phone her husband in England. She asked for permission. The other yogis didn't; they just took the phone and called.

She did the program, and at the end of the program, she suddenly said, "How is it that I'm here in Mulhouse? It was not planned. It's only the desire of one woman who said..." and she repeated exactly the sentences that I had said in the meditation room in Switzerland. And only I could understand this.

I repeated this story in the 90s when we were in Poland to start Sahaja Yoga there. Annegret and I were just the two of us, doing programs twice a week. The people were asking, "Do you think Shri Mataji will come once to Poland? We are such an incipient country." They were hesitating. I told them this story. I said, "Look, it was the desire of one woman. We are here, 200, 250 of us. If we have the desire, Shri Mataji will come." Annegret also said, "Let's give a bandhan."

About the bandhan, Shri Mataji also gave us the meaning of it in Warsaw, Poland. We told her that people were queuing so that we could work on them. Since there were just the two of us, we couldn't spend a lot of time working on each one. So if it was cool, it was okay, and if it was warm, we just gave a bandhan. People asked us, "What are you doing?" And we said, "We are phoning God without a wire." There were no handys at this time. We told Shri Mataji this story, and she was just laughing. After, she told us the meaning of a bandhan. She said, "You see, when you do this movement in the water, it goes very deep in the water. When you do this movement here"—and this is the Sahasrara—"it's going deep in the Paramchaitanya, who takes over all problems."

After one of these programs with Annegret, we went to the post office because her husband was in Switzerland and she wanted to call him. At that time, in the 90s, we had to wait for some time, hours, to get a connection at the post office. I went and gave the lady the phone number, and I was wearing a medallion of Shri Mataji. She looked at me and said, "Who is this lady?" I said, "She's my spiritual mother." She looked at me, she dialed the number, and immediately we had the connection. Annegret went into the cabin to phone, and suddenly I heard her shouting, "Christine, Christine, Shri Mataji is coming to Poland!" The desire worked out.

But before going on with stories about Poland, the story of my marriage. This was in the first year of the marriages in Ganapati Pule, '85-'86. I was matched to Herman Hage, an Austrian. The day of the weddings, we had the Haldi ceremony in the morning on the beach. Shri Mataji was sitting on a stone, and we ladies were all around her. She spoke very strictly with us. She said, "You see, if you don't want to marry now, you have to tell me now, because I don't want you to make a man unhappy. And never, never argue with your husband." Since this time I've improved, but there is still a long way to go. She said, "If there are some problems, just give a bandhan because you are the left side, and all the Ganas will help you."

We had to meet under the pandal at five o'clock. We were all there, two rows of yoginis, two rows of yogis. Everybody was there, but not Herman. He was not there. The place was free near me, but I didn't know where he was. So I just meditated. Suddenly, the voice of Shri Mataji: "Christine, where is your husband?" I was already a little bit shocked because she said "husband" before the marriage. I looked at her and said, "Shri Mataji, I don't know." At this moment, I went completely on the left side. I couldn't control it. In me came all these emotions of previous experiences: "They all wanted to marry me, they left me, and it's happening again now in Sahaja Yoga the same," and blah, blah, blah. I couldn't stop it.

Suddenly again, Shri Mataji: "Christine, where is your husband?" Again, I told her, "I don't know, Shri Mataji." But this time I went completely on the right side. In me, there was such an anger. "He is not here! He knew he had to come here!" I couldn't stop, and I wanted to meditate, but I was in a turmoil of thoughts. And again, the voice of Shri Mataji. I answered, desperate, "I don't know, Shri Mataji."

Suddenly she started laughing and telling everybody, "Look at her! She doesn't even know who is her husband!" Because she didn't ask me this time, "Where is your husband?" but "Who is your husband?" But I didn't hear the question; I was so involved in my thoughts. Everybody was laughing, and I was thinking, "How stupid you are. Now everybody is laughing about you. What should I do?" I remembered what she said in the morning. I gave a bandhan. In my heart, I said, "Shri Mataji, you know where he is." And I looked, and suddenly he was there.

And now Herman will tell his side of the story.

Herman:
Hello, everybody. I'm the one who is responsible for these bad feelings of Christine. I can tell you shortly how it happened. I was quite relaxed before the wedding, and I knew we had to meet at the pandal and that Shri Mataji would be there. I was thinking I would just take my time and see what happens. When I was looking around, there was nobody, so I said, "My God, what's happening? I have to hurry up." Of course, everybody was already there.

What I remember was there were about 56 couples sitting in four rows, and I was just at the end. What a situation. Can you imagine? Shri Mataji is there, I am at the end of the pandal. Where is my wife? But suddenly I felt a force pulling me right to the front. Then I said, "Okay, I have to apologize to Shri Mataji for coming too late." When I came to the front, I saw Christine sitting there, and looking happily now. Okay, that's my part.

Christine:
So, to come back to Poland, just some stories that were very strong moments for me.

One time, we were with Shri Mataji in a little shop of porcelain. She bought a lot of handmade porcelain, beautiful things. The shop was very small. All the time, there was a little boy, maybe five or six years old, a gypsy boy. I must say he was very, very dirty—his face, his hands. All the time he came in, the owner of the shop was pushing him back. He tried many times.

The moment these thoughts came into my head—"He should not come close to Shri Mataji. Her sari is white, he will spoil her sari"—as I was thinking this, the little boy came in. Shri Mataji took him, embraced him, looked at me, and said, "You see, he recognized me." What a love, and what a lesson for me.

Another story: she was in the hotel, preparing presents to give to all the yogis, and I was helping her. Can you imagine how stupid the ego is? At this time, my ego was really so stupid. All the time, in my head, I had to have a special present. I had to get a special present because I started Sahaja Yoga in Poland. I couldn't stop this thought. I was near Shri Mataji with all this stupid ego in my head. I said, "How can I stop this?" In myself, I just said, "Shri Mataji, please, help me stop this thought." In that moment, she took a box with a necklace and earrings, gave it to me, and said, "This is specially for you." But I didn't feel well. But the story is not over. Afterwards, she gave the same present to a lot of yoginis. She helped me just to be relaxed after this.

After a program, her feet were very, very swollen because she was absorbing all this negativity. She asked me to massage her feet. As soon as I touched her feet, she was screaming out of pain. I was scared; I didn't dare to touch her. She said, "Come, come. Strong, strong. Massage very strongly." A thick water came out of her foot, a lot of water. She said, "You see, Christ was crucified once. I'm crucified every day."

Another time, while massaging her feet, she said, "Do you see the light coming out of my feet?" I must confess, I didn't see it. She said, "Look." She said, "Every pore of my skin is a universe. You are massaging universes." These are dimensions not for us human beings.

So these are the main stories I remember now about Poland. It would be nice now to pass on to Herman to speak a little bit about Cabella.

Herman:
Hello again. Yes, I am an architect. I was very lucky that Shri Mataji called me, like other architects, to Cabella to help with the planning and all the things. I actually prepared some sequences, because there was a book in '95 which was made by an Austrian yogi with pictures, and I had the opportunity to write the preface. So I will read; it's easier.

"She herself sometimes moved from room to room so as not to hinder the building work. Her bed and pieces of furniture were carried from here to there, and everything was covered with a thick layer of dust. This did not seem to bother Shri Mataji at all, as she always remained good-humored in the atmosphere of chaos. She hardly ever left the room where she was staying at the time and never went up to the upper floors. However, she always knew what was going on everywhere, and she baffled the architects with her knowledge of details that one could not have without going into these rooms."

"The original walls are approximately 1,000 years old, since the building was originally erected as a fortress and a few hundred years later was converted into a castle. The fortress characteristics can still be seen in the four corner towers. In front of the facade, the south tower on the right-hand side has a crack in the lower floors that is a few centimeters wide and goes down into the foundations. One company tried to convince Shri Mataji to pay for a hugely expensive restoration, telling her that the house was in great danger of collapsing. Shri Mataji merely indicated that she knew that this part of the house stood on rock and the crack would not get any bigger. Besides this, during the restoration, she always let us know that Shri Krishna himself was holding the house in his hands. This must also be the reason why, in spite of some daring removals of walls and construction beams, there was never any damage."

So, I will end with this personal experience in front of Shri Mataji. We were talking about a plan, and she was pointing to an outer wall and talking about a window. I knew there was no window, so I was really confused. A couple of yogis were sitting around, and they were just laughing. They all had big fun. I was confused and, unconsciously, while I was talking, I put my hand like this. I wasn't aware that I did it. Suddenly, I knew what she meant. She meant the window which wasn't there, and she wanted a window to be there. The workers immediately objected and said, "But, Shri Mataji, there are such thick walls, and the bricks are like huge cubes." She said, "Now, go on. You will see." What came out was that there had been a window there before, and they had filled up the wall with little bricks. So it was no problem at all. There was a window, which she knew.

I must say, I was quite astonished because she never went to the basement, she never went to the roof floor, she never went to the attic, and she knew every detail. You cannot imagine. So, what a luck for me to be there at that time. Thank you.

Christine:
Yes, and some stories for me about Cabella also.

One story also involves Caroline, without her knowing. It was like this: Caroline was pregnant at the time when we were there. When I knew that she was pregnant, suddenly all the negative emotions came into me again, because I had lost a child many times. I couldn't get a child, and in Poland, Shri Mataji told me not to be pregnant again, otherwise it could be dangerous for me. It was a Sunday, I remember, because on Monday I was with Shri Mataji, as Alka was not there. All night, I was just sad, I was just crying, because I will never get a child. I was caught up. I said to myself, "No, you are going to Shri Mataji to be with her, and you are completely caught up."

I was waiting for her to call, and she called. I opened the door, came in the room, and there was this beautiful picture: the chimney with the fire, and Shri Mataji sitting near it in the armchair. Shri Mataji looked at me and said, "Oh, Christine, you are looking so much better now. You left the idea to get a child." But the whole night I was caught up because I couldn't get one.

So I said to her, "Shri Mataji, I accepted it because you told me, but in a way, this desire is still in me." She said, "No, no, no, no. You see, to lose a child is always such a shock, physically and emotionally. You are always looking so pale. No, you are looking ten years younger. And what is it to get a child? Food, napkins. Food, napkins. You couldn't do the job you did in Poland. And your husband, he's like my husband. After I got my second daughter, he didn't want me to go through all this again. And in India, it's a curse not to have a boy."

I said to her, "But Shri Mataji, people are asking me what is wrong with me, which chakra is catching, why I do not get a child." At this moment, her face became completely dark. I saw, I felt, Shri Mahakali. She said, "Who are these people who are torturing you? They have no right to torture you. They have to look after their own vibrations." I tell you, this was such a balsam for my heart. And this balsam, I shared it once at a seminar in Cabella, and you cannot imagine how many people were in the same situation as me, and how these words of Shri Mataji helped us all. This compassion. She knows everything.

Another time in Cabella, I was alone with her in her room, and she asked me, "Christine, how is it that you people, as soon as you got realization, you took to dharma? When you open the TV, you always see a man having his hand on a woman who is not his wife." What could I answer? So I told Shri Mataji, "Before Sahaja Yoga, I didn't lead a saintly life, but I was longing for this innocence. And I found it in Sahaja Yoga." She said, "These are punyas from previous lives, because you all were great people in previous lives."

There was also the situation that Herman already mentioned. With two or three yogis, Shri Mataji asked us in a room to put all the cartons from one side to another, to move one bed. We were busy the whole day moving cartons from here to there. In the evening, she came in the room and said, "What did you do? It's not the right place. Please bring everything back." Can you imagine? If you start thinking, trying to understand, you are lost completely. The only way was to surrender and to enjoy the vibrations.

Also in Cabella, she decided to go to Prague. I was asked to go with her. For the preparation, she told me, "Christine, go in this room, there are coats. It's autumn. Bring me the violet coat." I went in the room. A lot of coats, many colors, but no violet coat. I went back to her and said, "There is no violet coat." You are not supposed to say no, and I forgot it. She looked at me and very strictly, she said, "If I say there is a violet coat, this coat is there. Go and bring me this coat." I went quickly in the room. No violet coat. What should I do? But she helped me with her inspiration. I came back and said, "The violet coat is in the room, but with my human eyes, I didn't see it." She was just laughing and said, "Okay, go and bring me a coat, but not one with fur, because I don't want to show off in these countries."

We were driving by car from Cabella to the airport. At the end of Cabella, there is a cemetery, and passing near the cemetery, she looked at it and said, "How is it? I don't understand why human beings are building houses for bhoots. In Italy, they build these monuments. I can understand that human beings are building temples, churches, cathedrals to worship God, but even this... the real, true temple is the heart."

In the plane, it was autumn, and we were watching the nice autumn colors of the forest. She said, "Look, it's like the fell of a tiger." I looked at her and said, "How beautiful is your creation," meaning the nature. She looked at me and said, "But you see, the most beautiful are the human beings."

We were flying over a river, and she asked me the name of the river. I knew it, but at that time, it was a blackout. I couldn't find it. I said, "I don't remember. Danube? No, it's not the Danube, but it is something I know..." And suddenly, behind me, a man was whistling "The Moldau" by Smetana. I looked at her and said, "This is the Moldau!" When we came to the hotel, one yogi put on a cassette and said, "A small piece of classical music," and it was "The Moldau." She looked at me and said, "She knew it. She knew it."

Herman:
Really short, some sentences. I was flying from Warsaw to Prague, and she did not talk much. She was sitting in her chair and sleeping, actually, the whole time. When we landed, the plane was bumping on the runway. She woke up, looked at me, and said, "You see? German style." Because we were landing in Berlin.

Christine:
Okay, to go on. We were living in an ashram, and we were meditating in the morning. Once, the leader at the time came to check our vibrations. He was sitting behind us, taking our vibrations. Can you imagine how relaxed we were to meditate? After, we had breakfast together. We were only two women there; it was an ashram with only men. When my husband left, the leader told everyone, "Christine is catching. She has the worst vibrations of the ashram. She's catching on Mooladhara." Boom. I didn't show any reaction, but inside me, I was destroyed.

When he left, I went out of the ashram and called my sister in France to tell her this. My sister was good at this time, because she told me, "You see, Christine, Shri Mataji just gives us tests that we can bear." This was good for me, because no self-pity is allowed. After, I met my husband in the park, and he also told me, "You see, Christine, where is the problem? Either you are catching on Mooladhara, and you have to accept it and work it out, or maybe he's an idiot and it's completely not the case. But why are you so destroyed by one sentence from someone? You have to strengthen yourself inside and take the divine weapons we have: to forgive and to witness."

When we were in Prague, Shri Mataji's attention was on this guy, who in the meantime had left Sahaja Yoga. Someone told Shri Mataji this story about me, maybe it was my husband, I don't remember. When we were alone in the room, Shri Mataji asked me, "Christine, why did you not tell me that this man was torturing you?" I said, "Shri Mataji, I took it as a big test to forgive and to witness." She started laughing and was speaking about this man, telling me that he was feeling his own Mooladhara, because when he was near her, Shri Mataji's Mooladhara was burning. And after this, she said these sentences that every yogi should hear once. She said, "In Sahaja Yoga, no one has the right to use vibrations to judge someone."

One more about Poland. We were in a train station. Shri Mataji came with a lot of suitcases, and there was no trolley with a trailer to put the suitcases on. So the yogis went all around to look for a trailer. I stayed with Shri Mataji near the suitcases. Suddenly she said, "Look, this man is waiting for us." It was a man with an electric chariot with a trailer. I looked at her and said, "Oh, Shri Mataji, I would also like, in my life, for all problems to be solved so quickly." She looked at me and said, "It's very easy. Just be relaxed."

So, as a conclusion, I would like to say the words Shri Mataji said in the nineties in India, for the inauguration of the new Noida center. She went into meditation. We were a little group in a room, and she said, "You have no idea how beautiful the future is. You have no idea how beautiful it is. But prepare yourself. Before, you will get a lot of shocks. But never, never doubt. And don't lose the joy of the connection to the Divine. Meditate, meditate, meditate."

And meditate means to be in the state of thoughtless awareness. This etheric area where no negativity can penetrate, where yogis are building an aura of spirituality around this Earth. We are her hands. We are her instruments. So we should go more and more into this thoughtless awareness, so that her love, her compassion, can come on this Earth and fight the negativity that wants to destroy her creation.
