 (England)
My story is very short—three little stories. The unfortunate thing is I can never remember the year. I went on five India tours in a row, starting in 1989, and I can't remember the place either. But Caroline, you might remember because I think you were there at this first one.

One day, we suddenly had a message from somebody that there was a snake in the ladies' pendal. Somewhere in the ladies' pendal, there was a snake. So, suddenly there was all this screeching and, oh my goodness, all the women rushed back to the pendal where all our belongings were. We started to unpack all our cases to make sure the snake wasn't in there, emptying the sleeping bags, looking in all the sleeping bags and looking under all the clothes and everything. It was completely frantic. We were all rushing all over. Do you remember that, Caroline? Were you there?

(Caroline responds: I was there, but I don't remember that.)

I'm sure you were there because I have a feeling it was the same year that your marriage was matched, yours and Chris's.

(Caroline responds: No, it was the previous marriage, Rosalind.)

Oh, right. Yeah, I remember that a bit. Anyway, so we had this frantic afternoon, I think it was, trying to find if the snake was in our tent and then to calm down a little bit. That night, of course, Shri Mataji always used to come and talk to us in the evenings. She started to talk to us and she was smiling. She said, "I believe that you've all been worried about the snake in the ladies' tent. I put it there. I put it there on purpose to test your faith."

She was kind of smiling and laughing as if we'd all failed that test. She was testing us to see if we would... I mean, actually, some of the yoginis were very calm. I think they were in that good state where they felt that nothing would happen to them. I don't remember being so frantic myself either, but I'm sure I didn't pass the test.

A lot of the memories I have of India tours—this was another one, another year—was just spending days and days traveling around on the coaches, on the buses. One day, again, I'm sorry, I don't remember the year or the place, but I do have some diaries. They're in my loft and I need to get them down really and have a look at the years because most of it is written down.

We traveled one day for hours and hours. I think we stopped somewhere for lunch, and then again, we traveled. Nobody ever seemed to know where we were going. We sometimes said, "Well, let's try and find out. Let's ask the drivers." And in their Indian fashion, the drivers just shook their heads. They didn't give us an answer. We never knew where we were going, and we just traveled on and on that day.

In the evening, they just took us to a block of flats, like a concrete block of flats, and we were told by somebody that that's where we were going to sleep that night. We didn't have anything with us at all. We just had our shawl. You know how we used to go off on the tours—we had a shawl and a bottle of water, and that was it. No toothbrush, no bag, nothing. It's so funny, we just lay down in these flats on concrete on the shawl. That's all we had, nothing to rest our heads on. And they said, "Okay, you're sleeping here now."

I think we must have had something to eat, although I don't remember that. That's it. We slept there. Got up in the morning. We hadn't slept very well, of course. I think a lot of you will say the same, probably. There were tests of our comfort. A lot of it was to get over comfort as well, wasn't it? So we got up in the morning, had a little bit of breakfast, I think. The Indian yogis put some breakfast on for us, and then we just traveled back all day to the camp. That's all we did for those two days. We just traveled to this one place, and I don't know to this day why we were going there or what we were doing. I'd love someone to tell us what we were doing. But we know now that a lot of that was to vibrate different areas. Shri Mataji was using us, using our Kundalinis to vibrate different areas, and probably other things as well, and to get over the comfort. But we just couldn't find out anything.

One year, I remember, I thought, "I must buy a map of India so I can at least follow where we're going." I bought this lovely map and took it with me. And then one yogi came up and borrowed it, and I never saw it again. So that wasn't much use either.

Another short story is, I think we were in Hyderabad one year. It's the same thing again: we were sent off all day somewhere on the coaches. Sometimes we used to go to temples and things, didn't we? But this particular day in Hyderabad, we didn't go anywhere, and we weren't given any lunch. We were out completely all day, for hours and hours, and we didn't have any lunch. So we had to get attached to that, you know, very much like, "Well, when are we going to eat?"

Again, we got back to the camp at night and Shri Mataji came. That was a very, very powerful evening. I've just remembered something else about it. Shri Mataji came in the evening and she said, "I'm very sorry that you didn't get any lunch today. I couldn't let you eat in this place because there's a very bad reaction." She said that's always lived here, probably born there, and "I couldn't let you eat anything in this place."

I've just remembered that night. At this point in time, she wasn't saying very much, and she just looked very intensely at each corner of the hall. It was a massive hall. She looked at one corner of the hall really intensely and she didn't say anything. Then she looked at the right-hand corner of the hall and didn't say anything. Then she looked down at the corner on the left and then the corner on the right. She just literally moved her head to those different corners, and she was definitely destroying something that night. She looked like the Goddess that was in a battle, destroying something. It was very powerful.

Later, a Sahaja Yogi I met, an Indian yogi who came to England, told me—he wasn't around then, but he came from Hyderabad—he told me, "Oh, I must let you know that it's very good there now. There's a big collective there and whatever it was has been cleared." So that was very powerful.

And that's it, really. I do have a lot of other stories, but I'll just keep it short for now.

(Facilitator): Well, that was lovely, Rosalind. Thank you very much. Elizabeth, would you like me to immediately start and share that first photograph?

(Elizabeth): No, not yet. The first photograph will be towards the end. I'll tell you when.

(Facilitator): Okay. Okay.

(Elizabeth): Well, unlike some of you in the 1970s, I knew absolutely nothing of Shri Mataji and Sahaja Yoga. I'd already left England by then. Believe it or not, Jeremy, are you there? I had wanted to be a teacher since starting school in Coventry at the age of five. So, as soon as I left school, I opted for a four-year degree course in French and Italian at Exeter University that included a year as an English assistant in a lycée in Clermont-Ferrand in France.

After graduating in 1968, I married a French teacher I'd met while teaching in Clermont and went to live in central France. The marriage was an absolute disaster immediately. Not only that, but I had to wait until 1979—that's 11 years—for divorce to be made legal in France before I could escape. In the meantime, I studied to qualify as an English teacher in France.

In 1980, this is where Mother started coming into it. In 1980, the French government posted me to the international school in Ferney-Voltaire, which is on the French-Swiss border just outside Geneva. It was there that I first heard of Sahaja Yoga in 1985. So, to cut a long story short, in 1986 and '87, I went on the India tours with the Swiss Sahaja Yogis. I was rather nervous about going as I'd spent the summer of 1985 in Kashmir and Ladakh. I developed hepatitis there and went on the Hindu pilgrimage to Amarnath on a diet of rice and water, having lost 10 kilos and feeling very, very weak. Whereas the first two tours that I did with Sahaja Yoga, I survived quite easily without any such tapasya at all.

In 1988, I went on my third Sahaja tour, but it started earlier than in the previous years. I couldn't get time off school before the end of term, and the main group had already left. But fortunately, I wasn't alone. Mathias Kaluzny and I flew to Bombay, and then we took a taxi to Pratishthan. This was before Mother's house was built, of course. The taxi dropped us off with our suitcases not far from a big tent. Strangely enough, there was no one around. It didn't take long to find out why. We'd arrived in the middle of a puja and Mother was already there. I dumped my cases outside the pendal and sneaked into a corner at the back, feeling very conspicuous and uncomfortable because I wasn't wearing a sari, and I wasn't at all fresh after the journey.

At the end of the puja, when Mother was giving our presents, I decided to take my suitcase up to the tents to find a place where I could freshen up and change into a sari. I was about to do so when two yogis appeared. I didn't know either of them. What were they doing there in the ladies' tents? One of them, who turned out to be Javier Valderrama, the leader in Milan, asked me, "Are you Elizabeth from Switzerland?"

"Yes. Why?"

"This is your husband, Nicola."

What? It was such a shock. I must have gaped at them, absolutely speechless and incredulous because I hadn't filled in a marriage application. In fact, I was quite allergic to the idea of marrying again after my previous marriage that had lasted for 10 extremely traumatic years. I had two children who were now teenagers on my own. But for some reason, I just couldn't react. I couldn't protest. I just surrendered. That was no doubt due to the effect of the puja, but it was also because nobody had said anything to me beforehand. I hadn't seen or spoken to anybody. Mother had organized everything in such a way that I just couldn't react.

This was confirmed when Nicola and I did namaskar to Shri Mataji before the wedding. Can you put the photo up, please, Caroline? That's it. Mother looked at me with such a sweet, loving smile on her face and said, "Don't think." It was obvious everything had been done by the divine. It was all worked out, all arranged. I had nothing to say, nothing to do, nothing to think about. It was all done for me. I even learned later that Mother had been through all the India tour application forms and picked me out, even though I hadn't filled in a marriage application. Jai Shri Mataji. That's my story.

Can you show the last photographs? Has the photograph changed? No. Yes, that's Nicola and me at the wedding. What year was that, Elizabeth? It was 1988. The 28th of December. My son's birthday and my wedding day. And has it changed again now? Yes. That's the last one, after the wedding. Looking very relaxed, surprisingly, when I see these photographs, knowing how it had happened. I was really in Sahasrara. Thank you.

(Facilitator): That's wonderful. Thank you so much, Elizabeth. And Antoinette? I need to open the photographs. I don't know if you can start before I do that.

(Antoinette): Yeah, okay. Well, I just wanted to talk a bit about the general atmosphere and the rivers that we were discovering in India on the India Tour. Shri Mataji would send us into the river, not only to wash our clothes—which we did, and it was very fun, all the ladies washing their saris there and then putting them on the shore to dry in the sun. It was great fun. But she also said to take the clay at the bottom of the river. They were very shallow, and the water was very soft, very sweet. It was not hard water at all. She said to put the clay on our faces because it's very good for the skin. We were all having this kind of grey or dark clay on our faces, and we looked very funny. I have a photo of it, but unfortunately, I didn't find it.

On another occasion, she also said to drink the water of the river because it's very good for the nabi. The rivers in India are just incredibly beautiful. So, big foot soak. I don't remember which river. It might be Brahmapuri because I recognize the rocks, but it might be any other, like the Yamuna River. It was quite a sight, everybody foot soaking like that. And then there's the other photo of us in the river, bathing and washing the laundry. That's very sweet, I think. It's a very Lakshmi kind of photo. We did that very often when we were in India.

I have a very beautiful story about the Brahmapuri River, also named the Shri Krishna River. Shri Mataji asked me to write things down, because later on people will want to know. So I'm going to read out of my diary. This is really accurate. That was actually April 10, 1986. I'm going to translate it from French into English.

Before the trip to India has left unforgettable experiences. There are three in particular which have marked my return to Mother India.

I'm going to talk only about the first one. The first one was at Brahmapuri, on the banks of the river Krishna, where Shri Mataji had come to bathe her feet, surrounded by all the Sahaja Yogis who came one after the other to get her blessings. I was evidently amongst them. In the beginning, Shri Mataji told me, "You need to look after your Vishuddhi. Your hands are pink." My attention the previous days was not that clear, and I was still kind of being worried about things from home. So she asked me to massage her feet in the water. Then she said to me, "Better now?" And I was feeling the vibrations really clearly.

The circle around Shri Mataji was so tight—she was sitting on a rock—that I couldn't actually get out of the river. So I found a little spot on a stone, just at the feet of Shri Mataji, very close to her, and my feet were in the water. It was just two feet away from her. On the other side was my brother, Gregoire. Then Shri Mataji spoke about the right Vishuddhi. She said to my brother and to me to say, "Mother, I'm not French," and that we had to correct this right Vishuddhi.

Later on, I saw a miraculous photo which had been taken at this moment by a Sahaja Yogi. I see a triangle of light coming out of the ankle of Shri Mataji, two rays of light coming out of her right Vishuddhi. That must have been at that moment.

Then a very beautiful event happened. There were some Sahaja Yogis coming through the river to get Shri Mataji's blessing. I remember there was an Algerian Sahaja Yogi who was quite new in Sahaja Yoga. When he came close to her in the river, he had a kind of revelation. He said, "Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar." He recognized that Shri Mataji was Allah. It was very moving. He was in the Shri Krishna river, recognizing who Shri Mataji was.

Then there was another Sahaja Yogi who was Norwegian. He was very tall, an executive in one of the UN organizations. He knelt in front of Shri Mataji in the water, and Shri Mataji took some water from the river and put it gently on his head, saying, "I couldn't baptize you when you were a baby. I can baptize you now." That was like a biblical moment as well, very beautiful.

We were just completely enchanted by this amazing scenery, and we started to sing a cappella all around the river. It was beautiful. We sang first, Kundalini, Kundalini, Shri Mata Mataji. Then the other one was, Mother, how I adore you. All my life I give you. I love you. All the Sahaja Yogis around the river were singing, and Shri Mataji was silent. The vibrations were tremendous. It is an amazing memory.

Shortly after that, an older Sahaja Yogi wrote at the end of his diary that it was the end of his earthly trip. He wanted to leave this earth; he had his realization. He was an elderly man. Six weeks upon his return home, he actually died, very pleasantly, very peacefully in his sleep.

At Brahmapuri, we also drank the water of the river. There was clay in the water, but it was so cool and so good. The taste was very nice. And Shri Mataji said, "It won't harm you. It is very good for your nabi."

(Facilitator): Tell me when you want me to change the photograph.

(Antoinette): I mean, just to give an atmosphere for those who haven't been at that time. Someone talked about the buses, and I think it would be lovely to see the photo of the buses. There they are, with all our luggage at the top. It was all the men who had to lift all the suitcases and put them on the top of the buses. So we ladies were asked not to have too-heavy luggage. Like the first yogini said, we would travel for hours—I remember sometimes 12 hours in the buses. Sometimes there was so much dust on the road that it was quite difficult. It was catching our throat, and we were putting our sari in front of our mouth. Then a bus leader said, "Give your attention to Shri Mataji and Shri Krishna, and think that the dust is actually from Mother Earth, from Bhoomi Devi, and you will not be irritated by the dust." And we did. We said a mantra, actually, and then it was over. We didn't feel this kind of dusty throat again. The bus journeys were epic, I must say.

Also, I just want to quickly say about the meals. The meals were delicious. They were served on banana leaves and were cooked beside us. It was always organic food, and sometimes they even cooked chicken for us because they knew we were not vegetarian. It was just delicious every time, always warm food. I didn't think there was a tapasya there; it was really nice. But yes, I agree that sometimes we would have our meals at one o'clock in the morning, not at scheduled times. It was just when we would come back after a program, sometimes very late at night. We were advised not to go to bed and to eat our food, because sometimes we didn't know when the next meal would happen. It was a big test on our attention. We needed to be very collective and have a good attention.

Oh, yeah, somebody talked about the tent of the snake. There you are. We have the ladies' pendal with all the suitcases. That was at the bottom of our feet. You see how we were there, very cozy, but quite a bit squashed sometimes. It was fine, you know, very homely, actually. I never had any problems in a tent. We had laughter and some very nice chats sometimes. Look how they would do the roof at the top; it was all kind of done with maybe old cotton saris. But yeah, that's our pendal, the ladies' tent.

The other one is an Indian wedding very early on. I think it was 1982, this one. I was asked to be the mother of the couple there, who is Deepak and Amrata, and I was so honored. This is me in the white sari with the red flower on it. I took it so seriously, so to heart, and Shri Mataji was very happy. That was actually my first ever tour in India, so early on, I think 1982 or 1983. I was just awed by this beautiful ceremony of these Indian weddings.

Then there was another photo of all of us before our Sahaj weddings. Shri Mataji is talking to all the future married couples there. I recognize quite a few, and I'm just there in the yellow sari.

(Facilitator): I personally feel if Maria Amelia doesn't mind, that we'll finish on your stories today, Antoinette, and just save all of Maria Amelia's for next time. It seems a little shame to cut you short and also to give Maria Amelia very little time to talk today.

(Antoinette): Well, I have only one more story, if you want, about music. It was a music evening with some local bhajan singers at the Radha Krishna Temple. It was so beautiful. This was February 4, 1984. Shri Mataji was surreal in her beauty, in a white sari with a pink border. We were all sitting down on very comfortable, thin white mattresses. The singers had an amazing rhythm, intensity, and unity, which was absolutely breathtaking. They were singing the sacred poetry and the praises of the saints of Maharashtra, like Machindranath.

At the end of their singing, they recognized Shri Mataji for who she was. They were singing to God, and then they recognized that Shri Mataji was God, which was extremely moving. They all were going to her feet, bowing down to her. For us, it was profoundly moving. Shri Mataji had an expression of deep joy. She left us, blessing us all. The saris on which she had sat and had put her feet had such strong vibrations. We were covered in vibrations. The Indian garlands were filling the night, and we were completely drenched in that perfume. The whole thing was from another world. Shanti, shanti, shanti.

Okay, I have a nice story, which is not out of my diary because I know it completely by heart. This was at a concert with young children, teenagers actually, from 12 to 16. I still remember it was a very sunny day, and we were all in a small, white pendal. There was an orchestra of teenagers from about 13 to 17 who were all playing different instruments without sheet music, just like that. I was absolutely amazed.

Shri Mataji had orchestrated it completely. I had the task to hold her bag and sit next to her. I was elated by the music and the complete unity of this young orchestra. I prayed in my heart and I said, "Wouldn't it be beautiful to have children who give so much beautiful music and joy to the world?" It was like being in meditation.

At that point, Shri Mataji turned to me and asked me to give her her purse. So I opened the bag, gave her her purse, and she gave me some Indian money to go and distribute to the children out there, you know, the way they do with Qawwali. I was completely elated to have to do that. I gave the money to the children, and then I went and sat down next to Shri Mataji again and did namaskar to her with a big smile. She smiled back at me.

Lo and behold, three years later, I had my three girls. They were born very close together—the twins just one year after Mahadevi. And they are all very musical, have beautiful voices and sing to delight the world. So that's it. It's a beautiful memory, this one. Okay, thank you. I'll leave it there.
