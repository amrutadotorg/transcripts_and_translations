AI GENERATED.

Tinder of the camera. Um, and that's the only way we can actually show it. Because it's recorded on the, the English system from the television. So if you wish you can show it to you. Only on the system you've got in fact we were getting tapes from the television station. Will they give us a tape from the television. So that's I think I've done a good job. Oh yes. Because it deflected him so much, he came with a direct question and then it just turned right around. I have to tell him what to do, he was so he was quite a character.

Yes, he talked of himself. It's very direct. He asked me, very direct person doesn't matter. I said I better give him a diary answer. So This is like the socket. Uh, and it worked, you see, the, it's nice you asked me such a direct question. I come to say things also. It's a very good lesson, how to handle a man like that. It was a very good lesson to us on how to handle that sort of situation because he was very direct and very awkward, and yet you continued by saying what you wanted to say and not responding to what he was saying. You continued by saying what you wanted.

Instead of responding to his negative. Approach, very good. I do but not straightforward man. Because she said you, you could be a fraud fraud yourself. I said I cannot because I'm the one who want everyone against them. And he, he got confused, you see your divide means are you like a child, he said. I think for the child like. This is so obvious if you see the newspaper thing like this child being saved, you know, that boy was saved and all. They're in the newspaper, so they don't want to know it. So what can you do about it?

They don't want to know about it. And you mentioned about the Kundalini rising and coming. the top of the triggers for the seekers all those little keys that the seekers will know is correct even ordinary person will see the, you see people just not only the person who's interviewed, but also the interviewer. What sort of attitude did yours take? Really funny I had to do. James liked it very much. Yeah, I was really composed. I just love the way that it was always. we would sort of come in very well here in all the programmes rather about money also I said that they don't want me to pay for their salvation. That yes yeah.

Didn't seem to realise that it didn't have to pay any money. But just about it, you know, people have no sense of group in just Western countries. And it said that if your guru is dependent on you, then you must feed the guru, must try to give all the comfort, everything that is possible. I make him or I look after him. That's the point, very respectfully, but also he said that we must give some duction with the. In the that. You see Something. For his uh. Yeah we see somebody absolutely dependent, OK. Then you can give him some Doxina like a present, how can you. But not that you collect the guru to take all your money, everything from you, may rob you completely buy those boys, you know, but this is that so far in India, suppose I go to I think it's a great thing that I want.

I mean for them it's very fortunate. Then They might give me a sadi or something at the present. While the food. I invite others on that day. Mother is coming to my house to come and have food. That is the minimum you should do for your guru, but never said that said that the guru will never accept it. I see to give me usually sar is also so difficult, you know that I don't think it's an expensive present. I don't take. I mean I myself so to. You can't give that.

But as a means of, I mean, the only way you can express your love is through your flowers, not through something that you want to keep. It's a little little things you can do. There's no harm supposing you give me something, but you know I return doubly whatever you give me that I do, not others don't do, but I do it because I'm a mother. Feeling very hot Yeah. And since uh when I'll be travelling to India. Then yes. And before that when I came here when all CP paid I think last time you people paid for my family. No, you people treat me for my travelling, but I had to buy another ticket because I went down at 4, but in any case you can many times, you see, I don't count it to some, but you should pay that all this and self respect for my child. But sometimes it doesn't happen so many times when I repo my car so many times, isn't it? Yeah, that's for that.

I mean so many travel together. I don't think That's great. Every time you pay to me. So we have, isn't it? Sometimes you just buy ticket force me to not to pay some time, but mostly wherever we go so many times. I mean how can you, how can we expect you to pay for our salvation and that's even they are travelling with me in the car so many times I paid for them, but it's not that because. It's not to be seen, but should not be done. That's not good. It should not be done, that you should make your go to pay for your travelling. That's too much and then for your food and for everything.

We have had horrible people back on Peter appears. I was just, he borrowed 2000 pounds from CP and never returned it. We have had horrible people. I mean that way many have done many things like these, uh, people in Europe. In Portugal, what they did. that many people know that. I don't even know it properly. It's, it's so high-handed. I couldn't believe it. My ears went switched off the ceramics because I was involved at the beginning and I saw the things disappear into the depth of the night and I saw you giving thousands of thousands of francs to these boys and then I heard the end of the story.

And I couldn't believe what happened in between. See, That story was like this. These 2 or 3 boys met me in Portugal, and they got their realisation, all right, so they told me that we want to start a ceramic centre here. Andor you that And this boy had a big huge place a little away from. I do. About 10 miles away which he could use he said actually he showed me that. But They haven't got any cynamics with that. But They said that If you have If you give us some Indian ceramics, then we can hold an exhibition. And invite people and then talk of er. I said, all right.

I So they came to London. They saw the ceramics I have. They send all of these with to us. So I said, all right, and we packed up they were about this house full of ceramics I have very expensive one. All that we put in a truck sent it we paid 500. Pounds for that shifting and for the customs and customs and everything. And went at least there. Mhm And they said one day the boy came, one of the wearing a very nice suit and this and that with the camera jumping here and there on the airport. I said, how who's this? I couldn't recognise it.

First of, I'm so and so. So I said, what are you doing here? I said, have you not appointed me. I'm the director of the Sergio Enterprise. I said what? Director of the soldier went to pri, what's that? She said we have started a shop. They showed all that to a bank. Around that guarantee, the bank gave them 4000 pounds or so. They took a shop, put all these things for sale.

I, whatever they sold, they use that money for their own purpose. So ultimately I said you better surrender the shop, return the money to the bank. It's got. It's incredible moment, absolutely. No, no, it was a big problem because we had seen on this one. I do a precious things I had. So, I didn't know what to do before CP was a big problem, sir. So I, when I went to Portugal, I gave them 300 pounds. I said, you buy something and I'll bring it with you to London when you come. So that I'll say it was the exchange for Portuguese ceramics if he doesn't know the prices or not, so they brought one dog, one cat, one.

Oh. Yeah. When I How to man. I'll be laughing. Even now people take advantage. It's uh my wife. I say she She she wanted to get some Indian stuff, you see, masalas this that. So she wrote to her mother. I such a big box, wooden box came. But you see shipping corporation because CP has worked there for I mean it has built the whole thing, so we are allowed, we are privileged.

And also under law, whatever things come to us can come free. He brought and put his box with. You know last time, When I was in India, she she wrote to me. We one carpet of the side. We need it very badly. But I had exhausted his money in the bank. I was done for that. I said now what to tell you, but I said let's say the back. And luckily in the bank, the money was there somehow. I don't know how for the carpet, so I bought the carpet.

And the carpet was to come with all other things that were coming because when I'm in India. Whatever things I use, then they all have to come and they can only come by ship because. In that, I think there are 70s, I was 7. Things of mine and she put her 8 things. So when all the things came, they gave us 7 things and she delivered a 7 things. And when we opened the box. I thought it is in the box. We found all kinds of dirty clothes. See, we started looking at it, so this junk. I couldn't understand.

He said, Throw away all this nonsense, but 34 dirty clothes we threw away. We didn't know it belonged to me and such filth inside and there was no carpeting. And we lost the pocket and it smelled like a Bombay d Bombay dried fish. Yeah. And the car was missing. That's a big joke where is the car? They said we delivered you 8 1817 and at that time you should have told us that this missing. We thought the carpet must be in this wooden box, you see. How are we to know that Minoxi Day's big box is coming? I thought, but she told me there's a small box coming, so I thought must have put in one of the boxes, you see, I it might be coming with it.

No. But They told, they said no you can't find the carpet, it's in your house is that. The drunk girl must have got CP some 1000 I. Because he got right, it was an expensive, about 50 ₹50,000 you see. of $5000 5000 dollars. So he telephoned here and he telephoned there. They telephoned us. The whole office was went to who is this Meenakshi and why and this thing gone and all that, and you know, the king started saying that they are these jogis are using mother's privilege. It's a very bad name for us because we have been very, very sensible people all over that. Yes.

And the carpet was lost. And CP said that's gone. I think we'll never get it back. But the chairman is so particular on CP's things. He said, How can you lose his carpet that I'm not. I'll sack the captain. all things worked out and now when I was in New York, I think he told me, or later on he telephoned to me in Los Angeles and said we found the car. So what to do? Even This time when you people came, 7 people did not pay me. In New York.

In India. Two Americans who came, they didn't pay me for their food or for travelling, but they incurred also a. Um. Loan of about ₹6000 which I paid. They took that money you made to Kashmir. This is Michael and Roger. What Two of them ran away too, huh. I must tell you, those two persons who came from Austria met her Betty surprising. But no money, mother. And I bet you said it was a horrid place. I went there, I saw this and all that.

Oh really? She saw them in in the place in in Kathmandu. She met them there. I don't know how they meant that I should have, I didn't have their address. They sent me a letter. She would have been going back through Delhi to back to America. He wanted to have a holiday. They had a holiday, so they thought they'll go to Bangkok, but Bangkok was hurried, so they went to Nepal and in Nepal they found these people. Imagine how she met them I didn't ask her. She knew nothing about it either, Mother.

She wasn't in so she wouldn't know anything about it. But in any case, I mean, I'm not going to ask them. I never ask Michael or Roger anything about it, so forget it. Yeah. Oh yes, it's finished. And that Michael was fighting with um John. Really? I mean, 2 Americans came only. I'm right. Surprise I had a word with Patrick again, Mother, everything's fine.

That that can be arranged in Toronto quite easily for your brother. And we told him, and he said that's fine, he can fix it up because I think. You see in that it's not done, it's not. Whatever way you live, your brothers are supposed to live with you. I say I have a smaller and a big dog. He was only worried that on the next day when he arrives I must telephone to Michael and tell him to make sure that he comes on the 7th, but the 7th, so that he comes the next morning after you arrive. But he said the only problem there is that if he wants your attention. There are 3 or 4 press conferences lined up in that morning. I said not to worry, we'll we'll um. And also we can arrange for them to be taken.

He's a very, very sensible. He's a very humble man. You'd be amazed. He believed in communism, that's all. Yes, he believes in communism. He thinks that communism is the only thing on the lounge room floor will be wonderful. Oh my word. And who is he helping as a bishop. He's a lawyer for that. For certain thing they.

They have not got or something, so he's fighting for them. I mean, he's a lawyer. Communist lawyer. Patrick sounds much better, Mother. I think your Bundan is working whatever it's working. This is very well done. It's done it you. What about you people eating something doesn't look nice. I'm eating your mother and you are not eating. You all have.

No. Let everyone have something. Your programme in Toronto, Mother, is in the Trinity United Church. So can't fail. See, actually, I'll tell you when they come out of the place. Without taking the responsibility like felicity. Restart Bost Like this Marcus in the words of Gregor Marcus. It nearly became horrible. You talked in such a funny manner, I tell you, can't imagine. And said when I came to Switzerland, I found it didn't have a left side.

Now that I'm here, Switzerland has a left side. I mean so imperiously he he was doing this as he said it, you know, sort of. It's very particular about this that. I must say I just couldn't understand it. Dual Dual was very funny. He kept saying, oh God, I'm gonna run away. Maybe I'll get possessed by a Brahmin too. Brahmy. I think that's what he has done, you see. Some Indians have possessed these people.

I think some Indians, definitely from Brahms. well didn't want to do Puja. He said, I'm not having anything to do with it. It's so funny. But I see it because all these people like they take money like. Uh, I love it. Peter Pearce took away $2000 2000 pounds this time. All this is Indian style business. Yeah that boy in South Australia stole $500 from Sully and Phillip. and the very first fellow that came to Adelaide, mother, not you, you may not remember him, John Anderson, who stole $500 from Sally Anderson was the TTM fellow.

Ah, they steal always stealing that's the point. That's that's coming in. That's how they steal and you know, another thing, once we go to a restaurant. And Peter said, I'll drive you down. I know the rest. So it's a very Out of place and that's not that expensive, quite expensive. And you had, you had invited the ambassador or someone there, huh, ambassador. So when you read it, CPS teacher, you also come along and have your food. So Ri Ruth said hello, hello how are you this that. So I asked the person in charge.

I said, how do you know him? Oh, he comes said very young. I said, really? And I asked Linda. Linda said that every practically every night she used to take us to some Indian restaurant. So I said, why didn't you ask him from? Where do you get this money? And that's how we became bankrupt. Some Indian fellow cannot eat any other food so as to get to Indian restaurants. Tina.

Amazing how they work. That. They they are like that. They steal money. EMP said be careful. Oh, thank you. Who's that? Cacciatore, mother. Chicken, chicken cacciatore. What is that got to do?

It's an Italian dish, Mother, which, in which you cook onions and garlic and I would have liked that. Why to make separate for me now. Would you like a taste? Oh, little bit little bit, but I'm too a little bit. I, I'll have from you. Let's see what is. Chicken and tomato and paste, it's a nice chicken, tomato paste, and vegetables and spice and herbs. It's a, it's a typical European dish. It's lovely. It's a good dish.

It's quite, quite spicy and nice. Would you like some of your own mother? No, no, no, I'm ready. I have tea. Do some other tea you have Jasmine. I guess if you put a little chilli it will taste better. I just put this back into the main bowl and. Thank you. This house is an architect's house. You can see clearly run by an architecture.

So this white thing has left one more. to continue the whiteness of the roof, the ceiling downwards, isn't it could be for a painting or something. But there's no wall here anyway, you see, so that must be the reason for that. And inside is the for the fire is very good very good idea for. I think from that news programme tonight we'll get a lot of people tomorrow night. A lot of people will come from that interview tonight, I think so. I hope so. Because they'll, they'll come because they, the interviewer was very. Abrupt and very sharp and You just cooled it to put a sophisticated attitude towards the whole thing above it all as if he was above it all, you know. Yeah, I got turned around on him, didn't it?

I mean, you were fascinating, you appeared to be completely fascinating. I must say the way you deflected his questions and then gave him such a lot in return, you know, to sort of chew on it was very good. Put this in your pipe and smoke it. Yes, I think he was a bit taken aback. Probably a good thing that he didn't have much more time. I think he would have run out of questions. OK that he at least gave us quite a nice he said where it's being held twice, you see, he felt that there's something about then he did sometimes these interviewers. Deliberately have a tendency to sound aggressive, to try and sound impartial to the audience, but actually sometimes they're quite sympathetic to them because when I finished with him, he was much gentler thank you very very well. You that's something about the. Yeah.

But Italians eat that pasta so much I mean. Yes. Pasta they eat whatever they eat that to you. The pizza business. Spaghetti, spaghetti. Mm. Did you see Billy and Rosie when you were in Italy? Oh, very nice. You're working in restaurants now. Billy has become.

You saw him because he came to England, he came to England, um. I think just before you went to Rome. Yes. uh, he seemed very well. What will he say? Well, he was telling us just about how he was working in the restaurant and how his child Zania liked being out in Italy, but they were having this tremendous heat wave. Do you remember Italy had this tremendous heat wave and they were having temperatures of about 110 every day and the forests were catching on fire. I mean they were having a lot of, you know, problems because I really, really, because they were the worst in Europe. We had a heatwave in England and France, but Italy was the hottest, you know, the worst. What was last year like last year good?

A no problem was a problem there because you see he is a left-sided fellow, but quite obstinate, very obstinate or something or something that's obstinous. And what he does, he locks up himself for 2 or 3 days. I'm not going to do any work, he said. Now this fellow said that. You see, suddenly if you're working with someone and if you say I'm not going to work at all, then what is the person? Yeah. Just any luck of himself, absolutely. I Poor widow was very much unhappy about it. Mm. You do, yes.

the good. It was lovely the way the Italians kind of helped you with the house doing the marble. It all floors, isn't that beautiful? All through out the base. I gave them a special present. I said, you're coming to India and I'm going to pay. They won't take any money. Oh, that's nice. I said, Mother, it was a great chance to be there, Mother. So I said, all right, now you, you don't take any money.

But uh, you come to India and you don't have to pay for your food for 400. Do like that. Then they thought that it is too much. I said, what are we doing now? That is decided. So I asked 5 of them who were there to come. How's the restaurant going, is it going all right, the uh? It's going all right as such, but that pizzario, is she the one who makes pizza is $2000 it takes, so it's too much for them to pay. Now they have decided to remove him, so they are getting no pay or something like that. They're still working it out, but now I sorted it out for them.

They'll get money, food, everything, but what a place. I won't believe what a place. If you have to see the real you came there, the real blessing of your mother, that's the place. It's in this lovely place high up in the hill. Every room has got a bathroom. Uh, some of the bedrooms are on this side. Incredible. It's a tremendous place. But I think people don't realise it. They take it for granted.

But Italians that we are very, very sensible, you know, very sensible. They have the sense of gratitude in them and they realise, isn't it? You've also got a very good quality to culturally it's there's something rooted there. They've got a natural grace and a natural dignity and Imagine they would not take any money from me for the making of the floor, not a single pie. They, they held the programmes in such a lovely hall for Mother. It was a hall with a painting created on the ceiling by a realised soul and Beautiful. And you know, there's a dignity about what they do. When they sing to mother, they sing from, you know, from the careful about when they got it, I think I paid for the hall. But the hall was very reasonably actually it was very reasonable. It was granted by the city.

You see what happened? They went to the city mayor. I talk to him about me. And he's going to distribute them over the whole country, so you should contact him with magnificent posters. I'm just free, of course, you might. The Italians said that, you see, he was so impressed by the photograph and all that. We did it all free, he said, and he gave us the hall at a very nominal price. I don't know about $50.50 dollars or $100. I think it was $75 but for a hall you should have seen it, a huge big place, you know. And the town hall actually it was the town hall he gave us.

It's Sala Boromini, which is the famous, the most famous meeting hall in Sydney in the city, and then for the final night they hired what is the equivalent of the BBC hall. Oh, sure. It, it was brand new, absolutely superb, and fit for symphony orchestra concerts. Tremendous tremendous. And you. And it's never ever been used for a public programme, and that's what I said. When you are positive, thank you, then things work out. They themselves were surprised at how they were given all this, you see that free this thing imagine the authorities themselves printing the posters and placing and placing them in the proper places. Can you think of it? Very good.

And the hall that was worth for 500 to $600. We were only for $75. Ruth said even communism has some advantages. Putting the posters up. And we had at least 400 to 500 people every day, at least 500 people, and Austria also we had about 500 people. Rome, Austria, Geneva was very good too. Geneva programmes were full. We had a couple of rat bags, but Mother threw them out. Good. The Bible bashing, but the audience actually threw them out.

The audience audience. Let's go back one Mexican came forward. It's a very tall. To the shoes, but the best part of it, the fellow who came with the Bible to hit me actually was going back like this, you see. He couldn't come forward. He was going backwards, backwards, backwards, you see, though I was not moving towards him, very big fellow. I think he was paid for it because. Mangal Singh and this Brahan were coming that side. He said, Are you going to listen to these ladies? They said, Yes, why?

He said, Don't go there. You'll go to hell. He said, we are already in heaven, but you'll go to hell. Immediately they dropped down the thing. See that banner on the ground, you know that? Yes, yes, and afterwards they came to collect it. Mm. Experiences and experience, but I may say Geneva, even, even France was very good. Milos, Milos was great. Great.

That was the most crowded place, a brand new city. Milos, ordinary industrial city, and they did such a good job. There's a journalist there who's so positive and the pool was overflowing, wasn't it, Mother, and they all. And we went to another place, uh, Mal, what was the name of that? It all something. I remember because Vita from Italy but that's when Chrissy went there also, you see, they said we want to start a centre here. I think we never had a meeting there, but people came all the way for the workshop. It's off. Also Paris and the provinces of Dan Bordeaux is going to begin. Uh, actually, right now there is right now this, this time there's a programme on in um in Bordeaux, that young boy that came and in Moos in And Brittany, Brittany is doing very well.

Brittany is coming up Rouen, Rouen, very bad, yeah. See, France has flared up. I don't know. It They I think you have to travel, you people have to travel in in November. I'm going to go to English places except for Scotland I've scratched out. Not brighton anymore, I think. We had been right, isn't it. Yeah. You had, you had the Buddha's birthday. So we have finished.

I think we have to go to places, Cambridge Cambridge, Norwich, Norwich is doing that. Norham, Northampton that one Exeter Exeter, yes, maybe Plymouth, maybe. Something you might, what about um Radio Southampton or something like that? I don't know if they're there anymore. Yeats. Southern part. Maybe, maybe Sheffield perhaps. Sheffield, Sheffield, Sheffield, of course, and Sheffield, of course, and the other one is uh Manchester, Manchester. No, no, no, the one that is. Uh, gonna be.

From where we got Kirby. Yeah, we got Bristol Bristol. Oh yes, Bristol. Yes, that's right, that's in the west. Bristol, the centre is not good, but we get wonderful people. Yes, it's, they're also having the meetings in Glastonbury. Glastonbury, Glastonbury, which is near Bristol where they have the big tour, like this big hill with the monument on the top, where all the lay lines cross. Airlines Those lines of force that go there. At Glastonbury, yes. But also in Oxford, they've got both of them, the big ones there's several centres around that they intersect.

They're the ones that they know. The mother telling us about the ones that. That's right. I think Bristol is a great idea actually, yes. That's it now, this one is you're talking near Bristol, we went to that place. Welham and that's near there. So we had a seminar there, didn't we? I didn't see the seminar in Cheltenhamltenham in the gardens in the gardens, and then we went out to the ven Springs, and we have that lovely video film where you actually bless the source of the Thames. I've seen that video, it's tremendous. Somebody told me, was it you, Nick, that there, there's been a report on the Thames and it's becoming less polluted.

becoming less polluted. Yes, I said has to become the Ganges now. But there was an official report and in which maybe it was Magda or somebody told me on the condition of the Thames, and it's just happened. At first they had a flight that comes out like going to a big space and all that. Yeah, overflow, yes, that's right. There was a flood warning, yes, and you're saying, yes, you have to be careful because she's angry, you know. See, because England is also the limit. London are special. Though they have become more harmic, isn't it? It's not so bad now.

You don't find all those new things, all that's not on the road, you know, punk rock is much less, but I told you about the international thing. International. Exhibition we went to see in Rome. They have very nice things there, you see. Some were selling some fur, some were selling some things made in their own country, some beads, very nice handmade things in everything and also beautifully lavors and all that. And suddenly they said there is this is the uh this is the what you call stall of England. So I deliberately went there. What do you think it was a punk rock thing you know 5 coloured pads, 4 coloured shirts, these wigs, all made with, all made with hat and fuzzy fuzzy dresses for ladies, you see. As long as they don't think everybody in England is like that I mean it is so bad of them to put it there. I mean horrid, and the one lady who was there, she was wearing a very funny dress, extremely funny and dude, and the gentleman, you didn't come that day.

Now you were not. And the gentleman was wearing another. like that cock like thing, all coloured, and they were doing a very dirty dance there, very dirty dance, and everybody was, you see, I think Italians have a sense of ridicule. They have a sense of ridicule, and they were all making fun of that. All of them making fun of that. Rome is. It's got certain negative qualities, but the general quality of people is they have a sense of serenity, you see, by photograph itself they see to understand photographs to that extent. And what respect and veneration they have for thousands they were that day when we went to the big hat. You should see the way they behaved and everyone got up and so respectful. They just wanted to come and touch or they didn't bother her with fix my knee, fix my uncle, fix my aunt.

Just touch her and walked away and traditional traditional people's I think they are. I think Egyptians have that Greeks, Greek people have this traditional people, whatever it is, tradition is traditional. They might have been horrid romances, but you see, by By giving for so many years, you commit all the errors and you correct. So I think traditional people improve and that's why in Europe, England is the best as far as the young people. We went to Cambridge. Deal and myself went to Cambridge. We had a really beautiful time there and we just enjoyed the cathedral. We saw the beautiful painting in the cathedral of the adoration of the Magi the whole place has seen you must see that cathedral. That's Cambridge University, remember Melody, from Cambridge University. Yeah I came away.

First was horrible. Second one was only there were 5 people out of them 3 ran away and the 4th 1 that was left, um, her boyfriend came and she ran away too. So only the one left was his wife, you see, she got a realisation and after that I was so angry. It rained and rained and lashed. And Mr. Maya was so hard. I haven't seen such tempest and it was in the papers that. I had never known such lashes. I mean, and we were not all trouble, you see, our car was moving and the thing was behind us, never touched, no water, nothing on our car. But what I thought that instead of going to London now, let's go to Northampton where our Jama was. We went to his house and I cooked a meal for them and we all ate.

Oh yes, he told me that. No we love you. I think it might be a good idea if we had ashrams that were outside London but near enough for us to have programmes inside, but maybe it's something about living in Southern people are actually living in London, I think it's quite a problem actually being in the middle of it all. But we can have it in the north of London. Queen's Parks in the north. Yes, but if you're a little bit removed from it. You know, like you can go down to the city and work it out, but then you can come out again and clear out, whereas when you're in the middle of London, it's, it's quite difficult to maintain that sort of serenity. Yes. But Soberton Sea was a good place, but the people surrounding people were horrid and very aggressive, typically of southern type of people. first I lived in Oxted, they were all like this, you see.

Very adversity. They're the real rights siders of England, but the people in the Midlands are very, are very good people. And the people in the north are too much though. They, they, they overindulge the familiarity and, you know. Oh, they are. Drunk or Scotland, we were going to this runoff place and our train reached uh what time about 12 o'clock and we had to remember you were there at that time no not that first time when we went to Ronna, and we had to take a train to go to Ronna, you see, and they said you have to go from another station. So we walked. We wanted to know which side is the station. But every person we met at that time, about 12:30 or so, was drunk. Can you imagine drunk at 12:30 in the daytime.

Mhm Yeah, we just talked about sort of things. Is this. But we didn't know who to ask because we even fellow went into the restaurant to ask so they were all drinking there, so he came with a greater speed than he had. I started there. Imagine what a place it must be. Crazy. Oh. Delicious. But it has We have tried Scotland for governors. He is very anxious about Scotland.

But this time we went there, he came back and said, Mother, don't go. Now please don't go to Scotland. Where are you from? I was born in London. But they did well in that is. Ireland they did well and again there was a, you see, because they were nobody was in contact, so they wrote a letter saying that mother should come once and this and that. I said all right we'll see about it. The thing about Ireland was with Dublin was that horrible psychiatrist who was a friend of the family who all got their realisation. Do you remember? He was, he was a disciple of this.

You must have already got a heart attack, I'm sure. He was catching so much on the heart that time only that was saying, but he must be out already the way he's having. Don't pay your attention, he said to him, let him die. We don't want, he said he's catching so much on the heart that he's not going to survive. Wellta is doing well. Mhm. He is giving realisation to people. You see what he says that he calls them and he puts some sort of a cover on my photographs so they can't see it, you see, and they said, now put your hand towards the wall, like this. Muslims Muslims like a blank wall. They do.

And it gives them realisation. He goes on the back. You don't understand what's happening. They're getting well, mad people getting well, alcoholics.

AI GENERATED.

Like a blank. You know, they're. Oh, not there. But yeah, it's all full of gold. Golden, golden this, that our house, she said is absolutely for. This is a modern Arab by the sound of it. The prince and all that. I mean that prince who came to see our house was settled down there. He said if I had money I would have purchased this house immediately. Ruston is a very tricky fellows is a very tricky fellow.

Because you see, he had a lady who was senior to him, an Indian lady never married a very manly type, stayed all over the world, all over the world, you see, like she, she was the one who was head of that. And then he came and I said, all right, I'll do something about her, and I gave her band this Saturday. When he went back, he telephoned to me, said, What have you done to this woman? She's become like a. Little goat under my feet. I But Ruston was very lucky. He just applied for the job. The next day he was called, just like that. And for very, you see, he's getting a pay as much as he figures I think. Making a big one.

He sent $2000 for the American trip. So it seems now. We have settled down a very settled feeling. It's good. Today's last interview I knew, you see, if I boast about myself, then it works faster. I didn't both, but it worked out that way. The people asked me a very direct question, and now it will settle. I'm sure it will settle here very well, going to settle very well. And as uh Ron suggested, after you people get quite good at. Uh, Sanjoga.

Then you can shift to some nearer places like there are 7 cities, you see, so one of you can go to another city, another can go to another city like that. But one thing one must understand that one should never quarrel among yourselves, never should never quarrel, never challenge anybody. And now say Laurie is here. She's the one whom I know. And she's supposed to be in connection with me in the sense if we have to write, we can't write to everyone, and you should not feel bad if I write to her and ask her or tell her anything till I find she's absolutely useless. You don't bother about her. That is important. If I find her useless, I throw her out. There's no problem. But you people leave it to me, all right, so I'll be connected with her whatever she says and guides, we should go, and also she will not because she's a lady, the ladies have a little restrictive nature always.

I'm also a little bit like that sometimes, but if the men have the expansive nature, she should allow you to expand. Go ahead with it, but it should not be like a bounder also, see, and we must understand that money is. It's to be, one has to be careful about it. One should not waste money on new projects and new things that should not be brought. If you want to do something you do on your own, but not to bring the central fund for the health. Of projects it's all right for the programme or for this thing. Later on, I'm sure when you have more people here, you won't even need that much for your halls and things. You may not need at all any money at all. You might be able to do it yourself, all those things for your own. And that's how we should try to be independent as far as money is concerned.

And if you have any projects, now these people have had so many projects like that. I never give any money to them. On the contrary, they have been given money for this, they have so much money for the work in America. All the Australians have established themselves, always they have come. So one should understand that money should not be wasted anywhere. There's no need to waste money on things, and we should be careful because this is the money of the states and we cannot afford to waste it. You have seen how careful I am myself about it, so one should not waste the money like that. We have to still have. A very good school in India to begin with, and we have to have those 56 big ashrams that we are building for new people. And you can always go and stay there and we have lots of plans for you if you want to.

Have a heart in our land, we might be just about. 50 to ₹6000 or so you can own a hut there, but you see, we can give ownership as such in according to their laws, but you will have it as a what do you call that. Deeds or something, so you can have it all the time for yourself in the ash. we are providing you. But now we have one problem is to have the school. And have this Nega thing a little bit established so it's quite substantiated by Indians. Indians have never, never asked me to give them money. I must tell you this one thing really so far for the book's book, partly of course I donated, partly they did, but whatever was possible they did and Gregar's book was published, and now I have money for republishing that book as well. I mean, I kept that much money back for republishing. So now the thing is in the same way.

We should try to develop ourselves completely independent. Now these schools will be available to all your children, all those who are schools will be available. You can also teach in that school and also the surgeries can go for their conferences. It's a very good school and a good place where we are going to have it. But for that also we need money. And I think I told them that just now only if you can spend how many it's 100 $100 per every surgery we should try to save for one year and send it over to Arno. We'll put it in gold and I can raise the price of gold and then we can have more money. That's why because the amount that we have now is something very, very little to be sent from Europe and America because we didn't have so many people, but this would be only $100 for one year, once a year, once for a lifetime. You have to send it for this. And that we try to make something out of that.

Indians have already got 8 lakhs with that and uh and in Bombay they have daily they have got about 4 lakhs. For Indians are really, I must tell you, they have never put any burden on me. And for the 1st 3 years we never took any money. All those who came were free. I would not say that 100% they bought the thing, but at least 50% expenses they bor. He went with us one day, first time when he was. What was the year you were? I came to you in 1980, 1980. So we started this thing from 1974. So you can imagine 4 years.

Uh, 5 years. Yes, 70, 71 and 2574. 74 January. Oh, I see, then, yes, 747475 76, 77 774.0. So it's it's 74 5 76, 77, 78, 795 because I came at the beginning of 80, so we count 79 5. 5 years, you see, we sustained. And quite a lot of people ask that. For their food. Actually, the year I came to your mother, you came, but even then you you were offering to pay for everything and you just didn't consider taking any money. I mean we were so bullheaded we didn't even think to offer either, but never mind that's another story.

We paid for your stay and everything, but travelling I think in the end we did, but we needed a few promptings. Some people told me that pay for your travelling. Yes, I mean I really spent a lot of money doing that. It doesn't. But now what I'm saying is that now we have to understand that. We have to have our self respect. Actually, the amount that you people have gathered also to send to India is so little that I felt sad, so I bought gold out of it like with the back. So that also when they rise, this 100 will just be the beginning, I feel for the West. It'll just be a nominal contribution from now on. I think the West will undertake a tremendous.

Effort in this regard and certainly I'll be doing my best to encourage everybody because we can do it $100 per year at least, at least. I mean if we can raise $14,000 for America. I mean in Australia 15,000 altogether I mean putting my money too a little bit. It's only the beginning. That's a token. We have to think on a big scale. Every year $100 is all right, I think would be sensible, not more than that. Every year 100 means per month. How much? $12.11 dollars a privilege.

Let's start with this. Let's do it one year like that. We'll see about it gently you see there's not much need because they have got money in the bank in India, but I mean Indians if they can do so much, what about us? They will give you the land, and everything. And then when you go there, you'd have a comfortable place to live in. That's the main thing now you don't have any comfortable place to live. We do and we have to pay it's not so comfortable and we have to pay quite a lot to them also, isn't it. They'd be more economical, more sensible. And also now you see the prices are going up. So I have said now ₹4000 for a month.

Everybody is shocked with that only the ₹4000 but what I'm saying I can't say next year may not be so and maybe after 2 years or 3 years I may have to stop this. Then you people will have to move above and it's for you people only because everybody has a house in India. Who's going to stay in the ashram. No, I mean, we cannot have an ashram like this in no question because everybody has a house. There's no question of anybody staying in the national in out of question. For Indians, Indians, it is out of question. They've already established theirs and they all have houses of their own. If they are young, they stay with their parents and they have their own houses. So everybody has a house sort of thing. So, ask them if you have.

I don't think unless until they retire, they won't be there. So it's you people who need an ashram more than anybody else. From this mad world if you have to go out sometimes. So these 100 things you should send it to Arno, and for the journey is $400 400 dollars to my dollar account and for your travelling. I'll have to find out. I'll send a circular as soon as I go back I'll find out from Air India what is the situation. Mother's Laurie, Mother's going to try and make a block booking for North America as well as England and Europe. And at a good price and you go by Air India, no problem. You see, Air India is adjustable for us. We can talk to them.

They'll take all your luggage, no problem. You see, you go by some Iran Airlines or some sort of a thing and get stranded. Some people got stranded in Kabul. You know that? So why don't know this person got stranded in Kabul. They came by some plane. I've forgotten the plane. This was not this year, last year. I don't know I forgotten their names, and they got stranded in Kabul and then a telegram came to us saying that we are stranded in Kabul. So you see all these things one should not try.

You see, if you cannot afford to go, better not. But they mustn't go on any of these to do such a thing? I don't understand. You see some of these Kabul, what airline goes via Kabul? I don't know it's probably Afghanistan Air Afghanistan Airline Afghanistan and they got stranded there because this problem of Russian business. Afghanistan. So they got to Afghanistan Airlines from where I don't know and how they arrived there straightforward you must go. And another is they told me is a very bad one is you should never go Syrians. Have you had problems. I was stuck there with you?

Well, I was in Bombay, if you remember, mother, and I had this open ticket which I thought, great, I can come back whenever I like. When I got to Bombay, I found out they weren't running a jumbo. It was like a half-size plane and there was a 3 month waiting list to come back. You put a ban it, mother, and he got it immediately, but waiting because everybody was trying to leave Bombay because we were shouting at Graham for being so stupid as to book it like that. I thought it would be good to have it open so I could come back when it was very dangerous, you know, I had to pay a ticket last time we bought one ticket then we paid for my ticket, ticket. The whole ticket was cancelled. The kind of we had such a ticket. Don't go to him. In fact, when I wanted to go to India, he was offering, he was trying to sell me a ticket that was ridiculously expensive, you know, so expensive. Very expensive ticket to either he gives very expensive or this kind of this time he gave a big expensive ticket to us also.

Isn't it? Well, you gave him the instructions, to just buy it like this from the Air India. I told him there is one or you told him he didn't even was for 340 actually he still tried to charge you more. Then I said, but you promised mother 280, and he wanted to charge you 299. Really that's very bad on his part to do and he'd already agreed to gone to the opening of his new office as well he's doing very well with that, but he doesn't understand that he should not make money out of me. He very quickly changed and the first he gave me was so bad that we had to change, and I said now I return this ticket to get to Canada had to come from Houston up to Dallas, Dallas across to Los Angeles. Los Angeles we had to run between two aircraft. Mother was running literally, then up to here to Vancouver. All in one day And then a programme the same night. No, no, no, we not have him anymore now.

He's trying to cheat I didn't know. I telling me something like that. That's what upset Billy so much as well. When Billy was working for him, he said, I can't stand it. I'm so jokey. I can't stand working for somebody who thinks about money all the time. Mm I think it's much better to deal directly with Air India. So we'll do it directly and then give us some concession they said but whatever it is we we already get 10% automatically in Australia, so I'm sure will get better than that. I can't. Well, I mean better in the sense that better than they can get.

Yeah. Can you pop the cat out? CP CP said he'll get me that. He said that what is my commission? I said what is mine first of all. What is I never taken any commission so far. I know you don't know also how to do it. But honesty goes a long way. I'm. You see That way they have been doing very well if you see to it.

People have been living in ashrams in such beautiful ashrams in England, isn't it? And we have had a big huge hotel to ourselves to big old huge places. Then the surton was another big blessing to us, I tell you, and that uh Nightingale Lane was another blessing. I mean, people could not believe that Is that they're living in such good places. So we spent a little more money for, but all this is your own property for ever and ever, so it's all right. We bought some washing machine and that also we got so cheap at one for the price you. Yes. Nobody could believe sheets, blankets, bedspreads, dining room tables, chairs, cushions, lounge suites. Washing machine fridge freezer and one big you cancelled that 1000 upstairs actually that if you cancel that 1000 thing you bought that lounge suit. The parting from Italy was how much?

7 was the one that sofa. I think the red ones. More than that. How much? No, not exactly. You mean the red one? I thought it was approaching 1000, but I didn't. I didn't actually see the price on it. So you can imagine and then also 3 sofa sets. T3 sofas, it's all wood.

It's wood and sheets and beds and beds, everything, everything that you think of even a kitchen services, s, knives and forks and how many tables, 4 tables, 4 tables and how many chairs, 16 chairs and solid 5. So many things to a nest of tables and one big coffee table. and one bath bath suit, bath suit things that. Can't believe it. No one can believe it when you see that. Basic uh drawers and Everything And carpets. What about the carpets, carpet was for it was for how much? 1, not even 1 part per square yard turned out to be a very, very good bargain, very good bargain, bargain. It was 11 pound. Or 50% or something like that 1st 2 yard and with a matting, rubber matting.

Matai, um, Laurie was telling me about this house. Did she talk to you talked to her how much it cost and all that. Well, the owners are an investment of some trust company or something, and they're anxious to be rid of it, and I know that in real estate means that it's a liability to them and therefore the market price would be quite good, but They need to get themselves established with this registration as a charitable organisation, so I don't think they've got enough money here to do that. They're literally very near the end. It's not going to cost much, just a few $100 but we can perhaps all of us can perhaps help just to help them get the legal identity, then actually they get a further grant from the government for that on top of this. So when they're buying the house, if they ever got to that position. They would get a further grant from the government being a charitable organisation. That's good. That I'll give you what you say I was going to ring a few barristers in town here just to find out because I know the ropes or James knows the ropes from Australia. We've done it now and we can just ring a few people and see what's involved, what the costs are and what the requirements are you could do that tomorrow.

And see, you know, just what we're up for in costs. No. I mean a house like this is great it's a wonderful asset, but then how will you purchase? News coming. Yes, that's true, but you have to pay down payment or you have to pay it would be like that, but if it is a trust thing, then you'll get it for cheap. We may be able to get a co op type mortgage, a cooperative mortgage. James, good to have a little look into this tomorrow. He's an expert in this. You're the expert, mother, aren't you? Ah, you see, it works out, that's all I can say, but I'm not an expert.

It works out with me, things work out very well. It works out in such a beautiful way, sometimes you just can't understand. Mother, may I just mention one thing, the, now the mother ashram in Sydney, um, it's up for sale. The in, in Sydney, yes, um. I, before I came away, Mother, I made an offer on it, uh without checking with you first, but of 160,000, it's worth about most probably 190, but he wants a, he wanted 300,000, mother, and I told him that that was far too much. And he's he's sort of talking in the vicinity now of 250,000, which is still a long way, so, but at the moment there is a sort of a negotiation going on and then I came here, but I. I don't know, Mother, whether that would be a good idea for us to buy it. Perhaps that money should be better spent in India, things like that. I don't know if we were. See if it comes off, if it comes off, then it's meant to be. I was going to continue it when I went back and then you can expand it if it's a freehold thing, you can expand it more because you may have to bring something on an upper story there you see when my birthday was celebrated, I mean the people were really jammed up completely and it's a very huge thing.

There should be a place, I personally think should be anywhere, whatever it is where you have a large hall like thing because last time there were so many people. That's what we lack, Mother in Sydney we really lack that, and we'd be very grateful if we ever get something that's more suitable with a big hall like you often, like we found, for example, in Switzerland. That's wonderful. That's my feet. Sydney if you can get some better this is right or whatever you may say, but long term may not be true. I did have some doubts in here about it, but I just started it to just let you know away from Sydney a little away from Sydney if you can get a big place, it's better to have it. For the same amount you might get a bigger place. we would out a little bit, and that's better to be there, because of course a place like this is good for people to come down and you need something central, but one thing, but Actually, such a place could be in a good locality, some place where people can come for weekends can stay there for weekends, and they could be there. All Sydney people can come for weekends and then contribute to the cost too, contribute to the cost as well. This is a new idea of mothers actually where the people that don't necessarily live in the ashram.

All come to the ashram for the weekend and contribute to the running costs. Little away if it is from Sydney they would like to come near a lake or near a river or something just to come down there to have a little sort of a much better and then Saturday Sunday if they stay with you, you see there'll be more sort of much more than I'll get started on it as soon as I go back and do something that's much better. And it's substantial and nobody will disturb you there. The neighbours problem, this problem, and there's more space to expand in Sydney. You must have, you can get it. I know I've seen this fellow who was this what was his name, the one who whose house we had that lawn we went down, huge big lawn we settled down there whose wife is Polish. Which country, Switzer Sydney. See, he had a nice place, but the place was not covered, you see. So if you could have something like that and covered, or we can make a hall there, you can make like using the back lawn as a big hall and sort of we can have a hall, double hall, or maybe that for people, ladies to sleep and gents to sleep, some bathrooms and bedding and. Some bathrooms, one good bathroom or big bathroom for them, like many washbasins and things.

You can build something like that. They can come for when you come to India, have a look at the plans of the school that mothers that I'd love to. Something like that so that so many people are there, you see, the more you come in contact with each other, it will be a real outing. You can have your programmes, you can have. It would be wonderful. Everybody would like to be there. Because when we get together now, Mother, we have a problem with space. We just burst at the seams and we're growing so quick. And you are going to grow very fast because most of the gurus have withdrawn from there. You're going to grow very fast.

You must have a big hall. You can make yourself a hall of your own. No. The golden builders can build it. That's no problem. It should be double story. Why? Because you can sleep and do and could be bathrooms upstairs and down below the. Golden builder's mother is very prosperous now thanks to your grace. Yes, tremendous.

And people should learn from you, really. It's very good. They've never had so much work and all these things are working out, and they're getting all their work, Mother, in churches. Mainly Mormon churches. Mor Mormon Latter day saints. You probably, it's an American Mor nonsense. It's an American boish business where they believe that Jesus Christ. was born in America, I mean. Yes they do, and they're very, they're quite big in Australia. The headquarters is in Salt Lake City and uh and they're very, very big.

They, they're big on family life. Actually many of their things are dynamic, but they're completely wrong about them. What is the need to have Christ born in America? Well, I guess it's a bit of ego. a man called Joseph Smith had a revelation and he found it on certain tablets that was written on a mountain somewhere near Washington these tablets. They say the founder of the movement discovered tablets, you know, large stone stones with writing on declaring that Jesus was born in America. Well, who wrote that English language that Joseph Smith, his name was unlikely. Joseph Smith, you know, good at Smith. In that smith means smith means uh smile. with But it is that not not that one.

Uh. Uh Marjorie Bassett we don't show. That's not the way. It's very bad, bad manners. The lady who was our publicity who was supposed to become our publicity agent came in and the first thing she said to Mother was that, well, we're going to have to fix up your accent. You don't speak English properly, and the Americans won't have she said. Out of date now. So I said, all right, now how do I speak? He said, you say, we say thought. Not even that man don't like this.

It's hideous thought. It's a much deeper way, thought that's the way we speak, not a thought. But this is also ego, you see, if it is English language, speak like English. Why should you have American English? This is also another ego that we can do anything to the language also, isn't it? What is the basic language, why don't you speak like that? I can't understand. Supposing we start speaking like Hindi, English language, you won't understand a word of what we are saying. Hindi. It's not even an accent or a dialect.

It's absolutely careless, slovenly speech. I know that is accepted now we have our South Indians will say judged. Not a part. That But this is also ego, you see, if it is English language, speak like English. Why should you have American English? This is also another ego that we can do anything to the language also, isn't it? If the whatever is the basic language, why don't you speak like. I can't understand. supposing we start speaking like Hindi, English language, you won't understand a word of what we are saying. Hi Hindi.

It's not even an accent or a dialect. It's absolutely careless, slovenly speech. I know that is accepted now we have a say our South Indians will say judge judge, judged, and they will say like that they talk like. Like that, you see, they say like that, but it's all right. I mean, we know they are like that and they accept that they are like that, and it's wrong to say, but they say it like that, all right, judgement, they'll say judgement was not good. I like that they speak like that, and then we have also people like from CP province, they say uncle. They'll say a station is not station they'll say India India like that, you see they say and say I have, I have like that they have a style of school. So we all have that kind of thing in India. Even English people have their own style, so to speak, but that doesn't mean that if you have those things that uh main English is challenged and accepted to be the right thing to do that way. I mean, English must be spoken like the English, but now even the English don't speak like English.

I must. They changed the way some of these people speak, I would say like that. Pat or Maureen is not right, she's educated, but Pat and uh Pamela, and sometimes the worst is uh this uh Tony's wife, what's her name? Dawn Dawn. I can't understand what she talks, you see, she's she's uh uh 10 times she must put R in between. So that's uh another uneducated style I think whatever it is. So they also don't speak correct English. True, isn't it? But on the whole and and Scottish and the Welsh and all other Scottish is I don't know absolutely I Scottish hero Mr. Mark Canahan. I told him now, will you please speak write English to me.

I can't understand. I'm really, and that is one thing about me. I cannot understand any language which is so much mispronounced. So American is absolutely out of question that way Canadians are good people, you know, and also uh Australians, they have not changed the language, so. But Americans and they, they want to teach you how to speak English of all the persons. That was amazing that morning. I couldn't believe what was happening. I said she's never had this happen before. What are you talking about? She said, well, we've got to change it.

It's just got to be you. Nobody will understand you. And I mean, everybody understands what you say. But uh she she told me the answer. She said, you see Americans is a Humphrey Bogart style. She said, she said, uh, you put a cigarette in one side, then you have to. Putting these sides out from the other side, so they're used to that kind of thing. She made a thing like that, you see, she closed here and opened this side the thing, you see this. I was quite surprised to not speak like that.
