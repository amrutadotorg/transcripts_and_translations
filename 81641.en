 (England)
Thank you very much. Ever so loving, so forgiving. It is impossible for me to describe; I don't have the words, really. And it is not easy, at least that's how I feel. But we know that Shri Mataji asked us to record the memories we have of Her because that's one way we have of recording the human side of Her life. This is something that Mother is not going to do for Herself. It's our job to do. It's our duty.

As I'm sure you've heard Shri Mataji say, we have a duty to record those things because She did so much for us. So being shy, not coming forward is not an option. It's actually a duty. And when Shri Mataji was listening to those books of Linda—the eternal recollections of Shri Mataji, what's the title? Eternally Inspiring Recollections. This is the title of those books that Linda Williams was the editor for. These books were being read to Shri Mataji by a family, by the yogis who were there, very close to Mother. Mother was listening to those books a lot. She liked them a lot. Occasionally She said, "Oh, well, how about Mr. So-and-so and Mr. So-and-so? Have they come forward with some of their memories as well?"

And another thing She said was, "What about the things I said about William Blake to people? I spoke so much about William Blake to people. Where are those stories? I don't see them. They're not there. Make sure you collect those stories, the things I said about William Blake." So then Linda sent those requests for people, all those people Mother talked to about William Blake, to please come forward and share those stories. I did that. I shared some of those stories I could remember. At least I could still remember some of them, but there were some I had difficulty writing down. They were difficult to put in writing, maybe. I'll try to record those. I've been trying to put those on record as well, since they missed the recollection books that Linda was preparing.

So, I'll start with a very small little story, a small recollection that happened there at Mother's house at Shudy Camps. A Sahaja Yogi came and said, "Look, I took all these photos of the last puja. It's the first time I'm taking photos of Mother at the puja. So can you leave this packet of photographs and show it to Mother?" I had a quick look at the photos. I thought, "I'm sorry, I'm not sure. This could be a lot of work for Mother to go through so many photos. And I'm not really sure," because I thought they were not that special after all. But he insisted. "All right, I'll put them on Mother's table. Let's see, Mother will decide."

There was another yogi who also came, and they had a poster or a leaflet of the paintings he had made. And his idea was, "Let Mother choose one or two, maybe all. If Mother wants any painting, She can have it. I'll bring it to Her. So just let Mother see them." I also felt, "I'm not really sure, because these paintings are a bit abstract. I don't know." "No, no, just let Mother see it." "All right, I'll put it on the table. Then Mother will decide."

In those days, sometimes Mother would say, "Come and see us," at 9 a.m. or 10 a.m., whatever the time. And we used to arrive there and sit on the floor by the door of Her apartment in the sitting room. We were sitting on the floor. Tremendous meditations. It was wonderful if we could arrive a few minutes before the time Shri Mataji told us to arrive. But that day, Shri Mataji had told us the previous day, "If you want, you can sit at the table, on those nice chairs." At the table, I meant at the table, not on the table. This is my English. And so we sat at the table, waiting for Mother. Mother came and She sat at the table with us.

Those papers, the photographs, were there, and that poster—let's say it was a kind of advert for a gallery with the paintings the yogi had painted. They were there too. And Shri Mataji asked immediately, "Oh, so what have you got there?" "Oh, these are photos, from Mr. So-and-so. It's the first time he's taking photos of Mother. He's not an expert." Mother had a look. In fact, even before Mother arrived, we had already looked at those photos and the poster, and in our little opinion, with our very limited understanding, we felt these photos were nothing special. This Sahaja Yogi was very far away at the back, so Mother looked so tiny, very tiny. All you could see were hundreds of thousands of people. It was a puja, so it was not a good location to take nice photos. But then at the end of the whole thing, you had three photos of Mother, only three. It was the first time he was doing it, so we were not expecting Mother to say much about that.

Mother looked at the photos very, very fast. And when She arrived at the three photos he had managed to get in a big size of Mother, because he had moved to the front maybe, Mother tore the pictures. She broke the pictures into four, and that was it. And we were laughing. It was so unexpected that Mother would do a thing like this that it made us laugh. So Mother knew that we were laughing because we felt, "Okay, now that poster with the paintings, it's probably going to get the same result."

But Mother knew that we were laughing, and She was laughing too. And then She said, "You can tell him the reason why I destroyed the three pictures is because I don't want him to meditate with pictures that are not right. They are not quite balanced. It's best for him to meditate with better photos. So on this occasion, I removed those three pictures from him so he does not meditate on those. But otherwise, let him try. He will get better gradually." And She also said, "The reason I cut those pictures is because it's not me. I'm not actually there on those pictures, because the vibrations are not okay."

So what to expect now? We were kind of expecting what Mother was going to do with those photos of the paintings that are abstract and didn't look that special to us. But to our surprise, Mother said, "Oh, yes, yes, I know who painted this. I know him. That's his style. And he always paints me, in fact." "Really? But these are abstract things." "Yes, yes, this is me. Can't you see this is me?" No, we could not see. "But this is me. And this, oh, look, this is me as well," Mother said. "This is an abstract painting. So is this one. Oh, this is my vibrations." Mother knew everything about those paintings, although they were abstract.

So it really showed us how very limited our understanding of art or our understanding of vibrations is. We really don't have any understanding of anything, really. Even on vibrations, we are such beginners that none of us could get this right. And then, in fact, She said, "Tell your wife to come here. I have some instructions for her." So Carol came, and Mother said, "Go and purchase those two paintings from this Sahaja Yogi. In secret, he mustn't know it's me buying them. Because if he thinks it's for me, he'll bring them for free straight away." And She said, "I believe it's very important to sponsor the artists, to help them, to encourage them, to do anything we can. And they will get better gradually. But this is a person who is a good painter, really. And he always paints me, although it's abstract." But Mother understood everything, of course. Mother knows everything. We didn't use vibrations, and we got it so wrong. It was a learning process for us, but we laughed. We laughed because it was unexpected to see Mother tearing those photos until She explained the reason. Then we understood.

I'll move to another memory this time, which is very puzzling also to me. With Mother, we never know what's going to happen. On this occasion, Mother sent a message: "Those who are free, anyone can come and help. We will shift some furniture." Mother was moving from a very prestigious place on Buckingham Palace Road. It's a special place for diplomats, and Mother had an address there. She had lots of her furniture there, and now She was removing that furniture, somehow, because She was going to India.

Not many people came, in fact, to help with that furniture removal. There was only me and another yogi. And I'm not that strong, and that Sahaja Yogi is not that big, really. So between the two of us, this would have been a bit hard, because there was one certain piece of furniture so big, so big, so big. It was unbelievable, the size of that piece of furniture. Of course, it was much taller than the door. Any sensible person would tell you that. In fact, I remember discussing that with the other yogi, and he said, "Yes, I know, because I helped assemble this piece of furniture. We may have to spend a long time disassembling it if you want to get this out of the house." He was busy doing many other things, as Mother was giving him instructions.

I don't know what happened to my mind. Suddenly, looking at that piece of furniture, to my eyes, it looked smaller. And I got the feeling, "This might actually go through the door," which is impossible, because I know I had seen it. There is no way that piece of furniture could go through the door. It had been assembled inside the house, it was so big. But when I looked at it, it looked quite small, suddenly. So I felt a certain courage, and I decided, "I'm going to drag this to the door and see if it goes through. You never know." And the furniture moved as if it had no weight, as if it was on wheels. I said, "This is lucky, this furniture is so big, but it's on wheels, so easy." It just moved, moved, moved, and went through the door, outside of the flat.

I couldn't believe my eyes. A minute ago, that was so big, and then it became small. It went through the door, and then it was so big again, it was filling up the whole landing place there, the corridor. So the people living in those flats could not go upstairs or downstairs. It was all blocked. It was a problem to leave that big piece of furniture there. There was no space for anyone to circulate.

Suddenly, a man comes up the stairs. He looked really strong, with a big mustache, that type of mustache that is out of fashion nowadays. I thought, "Maybe he's from a different country," as this was a place for diplomats. He was such a strong man with such a massive mustache. It reminded me of those characters you see in the books of Amar Chitra Katha, the stories of India. From a little gap between the wall and the furniture, as if he was made of rubber or elastic, he passed through. I said, "Oh, I'm so sorry, I'm blocking the way. I don't know what to do, this is so big. I don't know if this can even go down the stairs." And he tells me, "Don't worry about that, brother. It's no problem, it'll go down. Don't worry."

So he went upstairs, squeezing through a gap that is impossible for a human person to go through. Then comes another man, just like him. I said, "Oh my God, this must be his brother, or even his twin." He was just like him. And he did the same; he squeezed from that gap like he was a circus contortionist or God knows what. "No problem, brother, just leave it to us, it's okay." I thought, "This is really strange." We are only recording the human side of Mother's life, but even the human side of Mother's life is quite miraculous. It's very divine, really. Even the human side is a big surprise sometimes.

A third man appeared, just like the other two. I even told myself, "Could it be these are triplets or what?" They looked the same: big, massive mustache, very strong man. And he managed to squeeze from that hole as if he was made of rubber. Then I felt, "This is really strange. You know what? This is just what I need." I decided to ask them, "Would you be able to give me a hand to bring this stuff down, this big one?" They said, "Of course, brother, leave it to us. We'll do it. You go home and take a break. We need to speak to our mother first. We'll go upstairs, and then when we're ready, maybe in 15 or 20 minutes, we'll come down. We'll take this for you, nothing to worry about. We'll knock on your door and help you take that down. Just don't worry, just go and relax."

So I did that. I went inside, ate a sandwich, took a cup of tea in Mother's flat. Mother was there, but She was busy giving instructions to other people; different things needed organizing. Suddenly, the yogi who was there with me to move the furniture said, "What on earth did you do to the piece of furniture? Where has it gone? You can't take this out, it's impossible. Where did that go?" "Well, I don't know, it went through the door." "But you can't push that, it's too heavy." "Well, luckily it was on wheels, so it went very nicely." "Excuse me, there are no wheels on that furniture. I assembled it. There are no wheels whatsoever." "But it just moved." "Yes, and where did you put it? Where is it? I need to see this."

So we opened the door, and the furniture was gone. He said, "Oh my God, they stole it! This is terrible, let's catch them." So we ran down the stairs to catch them. They were gone, completely gone. And the furniture was gone too. Then we looked inside the van. Oh, they put it inside the van and went away. He said, "This only happens when we're doing things for Mother."

Many years after that, thinking about this small incident, I think maybe the ganas, God knows. Lots of strange things can happen with Mother. We are trying to record a little bit of the human side of Mother, and it's not easy even to record those things and to do justice to Mother. Extremely difficult. Everything with Mother, there's always some surprise or something, but we laugh a lot in the end, enjoy a lot, and learn a lot with Mother, because Mother will always share Her knowledge so generously and teaches us so much and helps us with every detail. It's quite extraordinary. There's no chance of ever doing justice to Mother by sharing memories, at least not for me. But we do our best and try and record as many as we can remember.

There was a certain incident that I can never forget. Mother was organizing Her possessions to pack them to take to India by boat in a big container. Mother was dealing with saris, and She had several piles of saris. Only She knew what She was doing. We were bringing the suitcases and bags of clothes and saris, and Mother said, "Okay, this one this way, the other sari to this pile, the other one for that pile." Then some of Her shoes were appearing. "Some shoes go to this box, some of those others go to another cardboard box." She knew what She was doing. It was very interesting to see Mother in action, no confusion for Mother.

Then suddenly came a big box. We didn't know what was in that box. And Mother said, "Oh, no, no, no, not that. Put it to the side. That's too much." It was too strong. In fact, it was too cold. "This is so cold, just not so close to me." But then another yogi came later and said, "Oh, what about this big box, Mother?" And we opened the box. It was full of Mother's shoes. It was like the Himalayas were there in that room. We felt so cool, so cool, so cool. In the middle of this confusion, we all went silent. We sat down, and we went into meditation and closed our eyes. This was quite rare. And Mother even said, "Look at this silence. Look at these vibrations."

This was just a box of Shri Mataji's shoes. But my goodness, these were old shoes, perhaps, from the past. But they were there in that box, and it was unbelievable vibrations. It put us into meditation. We actually sat down, the silence was so strong, and we went into meditation, and Mother let us stay in that meditation for a while. This was not expected. We were trying to help Mother sort out some of the material things, which is a bit mundane, people might say, but suddenly we're in meditation. The experience of the vibrations that came from a box of Mother's shoes was so deep that still today I cannot forget this event—what a deep experience of vibrations, what a deep experience of meditation. And what a variety when you are doing things with Mother or have a chance to see Mother.

There was also a lady there helping, a lady who was not doing so well in life. She had a problem. She had good qualifications, she was studying university things, and she could get good jobs, but she could not keep the job because the boss would usually sack her in less than five days or a week. She thought she had a curse. So Mother said, "If you want, come and stay with me in my house, and we'll see how we can work on that." This is typical of Mother, the extent to which She goes to help people. This lady has a difficulty keeping a job, and Mother said, "Come and live with me. We'll work on that problem."

A few days before, we had also brought a whole van full of Mother's furniture to the camps, and this lady, the one who could not keep jobs, was in charge. So Mother asked, "Can you find me this? Can you find me that? Did you bring this? Did you bring that?" "Oh, no, Mother, that didn't come." "So what came?" "This is here, this is that, this came." And Mother said, "But this is the exact opposite of what I told you to bring, remember? I told you exactly what to bring and what not to bring, and this is what you do. It's all wrong. What a shame, because now these boys have to take all the stuff back in the van again and then bring another van with more stuff here. What a problem." So this girl was feeling a bit... she was kind of disappearing into the ground. She was feeling ashamed of making these types of mistakes.

I don't know, I felt inspired to say something in her defense because she was just disappearing into the ground, feeling very shy, very ashamed. So I said, "Mother, the van was so full. There was nothing else we could have put in that van. And besides, we don't mind going back there and getting more stuff and getting the right stuff." And Mother said, "Yes, I'm glad you said something in her defense. That's wonderful. I really like that. But Luis, you should know all the facts as well. Look at this. She can't keep her job. And the reason she can't keep her job is because she always does the opposite of whatever the instructions are. If the boss tells her to do something, she always does the opposite or does something else. She thinks her discretion is so developed already. But in fact, it's because she doesn't obey the instructions. I've told her that many times, on this point, to help her. And on this occasion, I gave her two lists in writing. One list is the things to bring. Another list is the things not to bring. And as you can see, she did the absolute opposite. So we still have more work to do until she's ready to go to work. I'm working on her. I'm trying to help her. So don't imagine that if I'm telling someone off, it's lack of love."

But she was not able to take this criticism easily, in fact. It looked like, "Oh, my goodness," and we were worried she was going to cry or something. We were looking at each other, wondering what would happen. Then another Sahaja Yogi comes and brings another pair of shoes to Mother. "Mother, what pile shall we put this one in?" Mother said, "Oh, no, no. Those shoes are special. These are different. Actually, these are not my shoes." They don't belong in any of those piles. "These shoes are from Kalpana, and she left them behind." And the Sahaja Yogi said, "Oh, yeah, but they are very new. They look brand new." "Yes, yes, they are brand new. But Kalpana left them behind. Sometimes she leaves a few things behind for me to give to other people, in case someone needs them. She left those for someone. But it's not easy to find someone for these shoes."

Mother was holding these shoes in Her lap now, like something very special, very precious. "They are so ladylike, so decent." Mother used such words. I remember She said, "So discreet, so modest. So modest, so beautiful, so discreet, and so dignified and sophisticated. I'm trying to find someone I can give these shoes to. But also, Kalpana wears a size number six, and this is quite hard to find sometimes. A lady that tall that wears size six."

And then Mother looks at the feet of this lady whom She had just given a little tell-off. She says, "Wait, your feet are exactly like my daughter's feet. You must be wearing a size six, don't you?" She said, "Yes, Mother, I do wear a size six." "That's it. They are for you." Now she was laughing. Now she was smiling. So Mother avoided tears after all. Everything ended up beautifully. No problem. There was never any problem, other than such a way to show Her love with such intensity that we could all feel it. So Mother prevented the situation from escalating, in case she cried or something. It ended up beautifully. She was smiling, she was very happy. Only Mother can do these things so beautifully.

There was a time I got the message that Mother said, "Come and see me." But the person who gave the message didn't give the full message. He just told me to go and see Mother. And it was a bit strange because it was Good Friday, which is the day when Christ was crucified, so it's never a happy day. It seemed a bit strange to be told to go there, but wonderful to be invited.

So I went there. And being Good Friday, Mother was not quite Her usual style. Not so happy, of course. It was more formal, a bit of a meditative mood. And Mother was going in and out of meditation. She was on a settee, and sometimes, I didn't know if Mother was asleep or awake or in meditation. And She started talking about Christ. So I thought, this is normal. She spoke and spoke and spoke, and then She stopped and meditated or slept or rested, I don't know. This went on for a long time, and She said so much about Christ.

Then once or twice She told me, "How can you sit there with your arms crossed doing nothing about it when Christ is being insulted?" Then I gradually understood what was going on. There was a film that had been released recently. Easter was coming, and the film was on. I think it was called The Last Temptation of Christ. It was a very stupid film. According to Mother, it was a horrible film. It had no respect for Christ, and there was a certain insinuation that Christ had a romantic affair with Mary Magdalene. Can you imagine? Horrendous. Mother was so offended to hear this insult about Christ. She couldn't tolerate it.

And then She asked me again, "Really, do you sit there doing nothing about this when this is happening? You call yourself a Christian. You think you love Christ very much. And then what do you do? These things happen in the country, and no one does anything about it." And then She told me, "Can you read the last two paragraphs, please?" That's when I realized, "Oh my God, I should have been writing this down, shouldn't I?" "Yes. Didn't they give you that message?" "No, Mother, they never told me I was coming for this purpose, to write down your talk." Usually, you record, you don't write it, isn't it? "Yes, but this is a letter for a newspaper about this film. So, never mind. Don't worry, it's not important. It's not important at all." In fact, Mother said, "You know what? Go and get a piece of paper and write everything down. It's very easy. You just stay in meditation and write it all down."

Five minutes before this happened, another person had entered the room. It was a very advanced Sahaja Yogi, very well-educated. His English is perfect, his knowledge of Sahaja, amazing. And he heard the last five minutes at least. So he said, "All right, don't worry, Luis. At least I heard the last five minutes." "Yes, but Mother talked for more than half an hour already." She was there for an hour, but in between resting and meditating, Mother must have talked for half an hour. "Don't worry," Mother said, "you can do it."

So we got the piece of paper. As Mother said, we tried to stay in meditation. He, the other yogi, wrote the last five minutes. I wrote the whole lot. And I can't believe everything came down, as if I could remember each and every word. This was a tremendous lesson to see. We don't even believe these powers are there. Then the other Sahaja Yogi looked very carefully at the grammar, punctuation, where to put the stops, where to do the paragraphs. We did our best. It looked wonderful. We felt it looked like we had managed to remember everything between the two of us. Mother somehow gave a tremendous power on that occasion.

Then Mother came back again, because She was again going into meditation. She said, "All right, don't worry about that. It's fine, because in the evening, Sir CP, he promised me he's going to look into it and rewrite it if necessary." So Sir CP was available to improve the English if necessary as well. "And besides, I think you did a good job, don't worry." Then She said, "Why don't you watch some TV now?" So we put the TV on, and it was some golf. We put it on without sound because Mother was either in meditation or asleep. And then She dictated more, and we wrote a bit more, and then the job was done. This memory stayed with me forever because of being able to write down what Mother said, word for word. Some powers of meditation, we forget they exist. I didn't have that type of memory at all.

Later on, this story came in very handy because much later, there was another film called The Da Vinci Code. And The Da Vinci Code is a similar situation where the author is implying there is a kind of romantic relationship between Christ and Mary Magdalene, like that film which Mother protested so strongly. And She wrote the letter for the newspapers. The letter was sent to the editors of several newspapers in England to influence them, so the editors would know what's right and what's wrong, at least. They might not publish the letter of Shri Mataji, but at least they would read it and know that this is wrong.

And now, many years later, there is this Da Vinci Code film. A Sahaja Yogi came to England to investigate this, to see if there was any factual truth about it, to visit the locations and see what was available. But then I told him, "Look, what Mother said about that other film was incredible. You cannot have even this type of thought about Christ and Mary Magdalene; it's a big, big insult." Although it wasn't easy to go and ask Mother by then, because Shri Mataji had announced that She had retired a little bit from deciding everything, so people couldn't go so easily and ask questions.

So I said, "Look, this has a lot in common with that film that Mother wrote such a strong protest about." And he said, "Oh my goodness, why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you share that memory? It would have saved me the trip. If I hadn't met you, I might have written something wrong on this subject." So this is a very important memory. Yes, it is important. However, even on Her tapes, Mother said exactly the same thing some years ago. Even before that film The Last Temptation of Christ came about, Mother had already put on Her tapes, on Her talks, that if we cannot conceive of a pure relationship between Christ and Mary Magdalene, this is a sign that we have a perverted mind. We have to understand that Christ is someone of such high standards of dharma that if He needed to take a wife, He would, but He would marry her, not have an affair. Only the highest dharma, because this is Christ. So that knowledge came in handy.

Much later, another Sahaja Yogi wrote a story which was an imitation of The Da Vinci Code. And the way he wrote it, although he was a Sahaja Yogi, he also would not have known this aspect of what Mother said, although it's on a tape of Mother's. It's hard to listen to every tape. So he wrote a kind of romantic novel between Christ and Mary Magdalene. When I read that book, I was horrified. Oh my goodness. We could not go to Mother with these things by then, as Mother was officially semi-retired from deciding everything. So there was at least a Sahaja Publications Committee, with very great Sahaja Yogis in it. In general, I would not have even written an email about this, but because Mother gave me such a warning—"What are you doing? Do you cross your arms and do nothing about it when Christ is insulted?"—I felt, "All right, I really cannot cross my arms this time." I had to write an email to that Publications Committee to request that they don't allow this book to be sold in Sahaja at the pujas. And so it happened. They did that.

So there you go. Any small memories of Mother, they don't seem essential sometimes, because even things Mother already said are on the tapes in any case. That experience came in very handy for me because I was able to help two Sahaja Yogis prevent a big mistake. In fact, some people even thought maybe this book should become a TEV play. TEV means Theatre of Eternal Values, a theatre company for doing plays for Shri Mataji during the pujas. Some people felt, "Why not turn this into a play for Mother?" So really, out of one memory of Mother, something useful came out. There was no question of doing a TEV play about that book. In fact, that book was actually prohibited in Sahaja. And that other Sahaja Yogi also didn't have to waste time investigating The Da Vinci Code. This is just to accentuate the importance of each and every little memory that we still remember from Mother and its usefulness sometimes.

It's interesting, because much later, Shri Mataji told me why She invited me to write down what She was saying. It was a little test for me to be able to write down what Mother said afterwards, because Mother had told me to write about Sahaja Yoga, and I always felt I couldn't. "My English is not good enough," a lack of confidence. But Mother knew that I wanted to write, because I wanted to write even before Sahaja Yoga. So this was like a little exercise to boost my confidence that I could write.

On another occasion, She also asked me to write a testimonial about Sahaja Yoga, to say how much I and my family benefited from Sahaja, and also to give a testimonial about how other people have benefited so much. So I thought, this is quite a responsibility to write an article like that for the newspapers in India. And again, I said the same to Mother, "I don't know what to write, Mother." And Mother dictated the whole article to me. The next day when I wrote it, it all came back to me word for word, what Mother had said. And certain things Mother didn't say fully, but gave me hints of how to say it or what to say. At last, I felt confident. Maybe now I can write about Sahaja Yoga. I was not sure if it was perfect, but Mother said, "Don't worry, because the Indian Sahaja Yogis are going to translate it to Marathi. So if the English is not perfect, what counts is if you managed to put those points across that I told you." It was all there. Mother checked the vibrations. That's fine. At last, I felt the confidence I could write about Sahaja Yoga, as Mother had told me to write.

At the same time, I was reading a book about false gurus. I thought, "Interesting, let's read this book denouncing the false gurus." As it turns out, this writer, he was denouncing false gurus, no doubt, but he was also writing against God, against Christ, against Moses, against Abraham, against Shri Krishna, against Shri Ganesha—everything. He didn't spare anyone. This was not a genuine book against false gurus. The man writing it, he himself was a false guru. And then I noticed, "Oh my God, now he's criticizing Mother too." He said, "These vibrations of this lady, Nirmala Devi, this is not genuine. This is not scientifically proved." So I underlined those sentences in red and took the book to Mother.

I asked Mother, "Do you know about this man? This guy is appalling." And She said, "Do I know about this man? This is the guru whose disciples are writing articles against Sahaja Yoga in Maharashtra. It is also the man whose disciples were throwing stones at the Sahaja Yogis." A very serious incident this man had caused indirectly. And then Mother told me about him. This man says that he only believes in rationality and in science and in the facts, nothing to do with superstition, he said. But really, he was just totally anti-God and didn't understand anything.

That's when Mother said, "Look, I told you to write about Sahaja Yoga, and here's a good subject for you to write about. Write about William Blake, because William Blake spent his whole life writing against rationality, against the intellect, against these so-called mundane philosophers who don't have any respect for God. This is what Blake fought all his life. So since I asked you to write about Sahaja Yoga, this is a good subject for you." And by then, my confidence at last was a little bit boosted. So Mother helped me a lot in being able to write a little bit about William Blake.

So when people ask me, what is the essence of what Mother told you about William Blake? What I've just said, this is, I believe, the essence: that the most important thing about William Blake is to go beyond the mind, to go into thoughtless awareness, to go into deeper meditation, and to put aside this temptation of analyzing everything or understanding everything rationally, because we don't. Without vibrations, we don't understand anything. And especially Blake. Blake is about vibrations, it's about going beyond the brain, going to a very deep state of meditation. And he's actually a great prophet of Sahaja Yoga. Mother also explained that to everybody. This has been explained by Mother hundreds of times, in fact.

William Blake also made some paintings of Mary Magdalene. In the olden days, people used to think that certain ladies there in the Bible were always Mary Magdalene. Nowadays, scholars are saying that there's more than one woman. But even the woman in the parable of the woman taken in adultery, who was caught in adultery, Christ came and defended her and said, "Let the one who is without sin throw the first stone." William Blake did a beautiful painting of this incident, where Christ is actually defending her. We could say this is Mary Magdalene. Mother sometimes calls this woman Mary Magdalene in Her talks. And She says there's no relationship whatsoever between Christ and Mary Magdalene. Mother has explained this so many times. But Blake gave such a pure, pure painting of Mary Magdalene, in which she is described just like Mother describes her. Mother described Mary Magdalene as someone that Christ removed all the sins from, everything. She was just absolutely pure and beautiful. That's the state in which He left her, of course, with His powers. But that's just a disciple. It's an absolutely pure relationship.

There's another painting that William Blake did of Mary Magdalene, which is Christ Interceding on Behalf of Mary Magdalene. This is one of the most beautiful paintings Blake did. God is sitting in judgment, and then we have Christ in the middle defending Mary Magdalene again, and Magdalene is there like a great devotee of God, bowing down. Everybody says this is one of the most beautiful paintings William Blake made of Mary Magdalene, and it really describes Sahaja Yoga. Everything Mother says, you can see sometimes a reflection in his paintings, because he was such a great prophet of Sahaja Yoga.

But Mother told me other things about William Blake. I don't know why, but partly because I was living at Chesham Road, and Chesham Road is such an important place for William Blake; he prophesied about Chesham Road. Also, before coming to Sahaja, I was already very interested in William Blake for the last two years. And I felt at the time William Blake helped me a lot in my seeking. At the same time, I also found the photo of Shri Mataji—not Mother in person, but I found the photo of Shri Mataji for two years before meeting Mother. So I had the photo, I had William Blake, and this was helping me a lot. I had a certain strong feeling about William Blake, and wrote a little something about him once or twice, and Mother said She liked that. So it's all these circumstances put together that may explain why Mother asked me to write about William Blake. And I was someone who felt very unprepared for that, not able to do it easily, but gradually Mother gave that power somehow.

There was a great miracle: we discovered the location of the grave of William Blake with Mother's help. And so it all started. We had to write about that in order to be able to mark the location of Blake's grave. This is something Mother had said that needed to be done. The grave of William Blake was not properly respected, so it was necessary to do something nice about it. We were so lucky; it happened to us that we were able to rediscover that location, and there was no way out. Now we really had to write about William Blake to help create a certain interest about it. We ended up going to the BBC; we were invited by the BBC to give a program about the location of the graves of William Blake and his wife. So it took many years of Mother somehow supporting me and giving me the confidence to be able to do this.

But Mother taught me other things about William Blake. I remember one very important occasion, and this is very easy to share with everybody. We were there at Mother's house. I remember I was doing a little bit of gilding, something very simple. There was also a friend, George, visiting England. He was doing a bit of gilding with me. Other people were doing other jobs, sometimes much bigger jobs: plastering or cement or drilling, carpentry, big jobs. So the message came, "Mother will now speak to all of you. So come to the sitting room." We went immediately. We were doing a very easy job, not very dirty, so we didn't have to change clothes or even wash our hands. We went immediately and sat there. Mother said, "We won't start until the others arrive. We'll wait for them." So we were sitting in silence there in front of Mother.

Mother was sitting down, and what a bliss just to be there. Then my friend George says, "Mother, on your coffee table, that's a book of William Blake, isn't it? Can I look at it?" And Mother said, "Of course you can. But I'll tell you what, good idea. I'm going to show this book to everybody. Let's wait until the others arrive. They're coming soon." They had to change clothes or wash their hands from other building jobs or paint, maybe. Gradually they came, one by one.

Mother was looking at the book of William Blake's paintings. And every time Mother looked at a painting, Her face changed, transformed. And She was just making sounds like, "Wow, wow, wow, fantastic, incredible, amazing." And She kept going through the paintings of William Blake, page by page. And every time, sometimes Mother would put Her eyes very close to the painting, other times very far away. But all the time She was saying, "Wonderful, really, wonderful, wow, wow, wow, incredible."

At last, everybody arrived, and Mother started showing the book to us. She would look at the painting, then She would show it to us. And the moment She showed it to us, it was like a big wave of vibrations was coming to us. A really, really big wave, a bit like when that box of Mother's shoes was opened. Tremendous, incredible. It was putting us in meditation. Of course, Mother was holding the book in Her hands and had looked into it, so now the effect was so powerful. Automatically, as soon as we saw the painting ourselves, we all said, "Wow, wow, wow, amazing, incredible." We could feel the waves of vibrations. And Mother was saying, "Yes, yes, just enjoy the vibrations, enjoy the vibrations."

Having shown the painting, She would show us, "Can you see here the chakras? See, these are the chakras." "Oh, yes, yes, you can see it, Mother." "You see the hands above the Sahasrara? Oh, yes, yes. Look at this painting, the other painting, next painting. Can you see this? The hands feeling the vibrations, see? It's about Sahaja Yoga. Can you see the Sahasrara chakra in this painting? Or look at the Agnya chakra in this painting?" The things Mother could see. Mother could see the whole thing about Sahaja Yoga in each and every painting. There was not a single painting that did not have such incredible elements about Sahaja Yoga in it.

They were very powerful. All we had to do was to enjoy the vibrations. We didn't have to have tremendous scholarly knowledge of these paintings and understand everything like the scholars do. All we had to do was feel the vibrations. What a deep experience. Tremendous vibrations. And by the end of the book, even before Mother told us what the chakras were, we were telling Mother, all of us, "Oh, look, Mother, I can see the three channels there." "Oh, yes, yes, the three channels, yes." "The chakras there or the person feeling vibrations with the hands here or there or big auras." Mother showed tremendous appreciation for the paintings of Christ done by Blake. Mother was very, very appreciative of those. And another thing was the paintings of the Madonna and Child, the Virgin Mary with the baby Jesus. Mother liked those paintings a lot also that Blake did. Blake did a few of those that are amazing, really.

It's hard to find a person more enthusiastic about Blake than Shri Mataji. She has such tremendous love for William Blake. William Blake suffered so much when he came on this earth, and Mother says sometimes on Her talks that She cries when She's reading about William Blake or seeing his paintings, because of how much he suffered in that lifetime, talking to people who couldn't understand anything. But he came to pave the way for Sahaja Yoga as a prophet of Shri Mataji. So what an important thing he did. Christ had many prophets too, and Mother had many prophets too, not just William Blake. But William Blake is one of those prophets that came and did a lot of work for Mother, for Sahaja Yoga. And Mother pays him such tremendous respect and love. You will not find someone who loves Blake more than Mother, really. As if he's a child of Mother. In fact, he is a child of Mother. There's no doubt about it.

These are stories I did not manage to write down and send to Linda. I sent a few, but not these. One day, Mother took us to the Tate Gallery to see the paintings of William Blake. And it was incredible to see Mother there, because Mother saw each and every painting very carefully. She even read the curator notes on the wall, because sometimes there's a little explanation about the painting. Mother read those notes very carefully. She studied each and every painting carefully. But She did something extra: She put Her hands towards the painting to check the vibrations. This is a bit strange, because this was in public. There were many people there in the museum, and Mother was actually putting Her hands towards the painting to feel the vibrations. And She told us the same. "Can you check the vibrations of this painting? Isn't this amazing? What tremendous vibrations."

In fact, the thing Mother said the most that day was "tremendous vibrations." "Tremendous vibrations. Can you feel the vibrations of this painting of William Blake? Check the vibrations. Can you feel the vibrations? Tremendous vibrations." So when people ask me, what is the essence of what Mother told you about William Blake? I believe this is the essence. Tremendous vibrations on the paintings. Check the vibrations. Enjoy the vibrations. And feel the vibrations of those paintings. To me, this is the essence of what Mother told me about William Blake.

Another thing Mother did at that museum was also quite interesting. At the very end of the exhibition, there was a cabinet with some very, very tiny engravings that William Blake made. They're called the Virgil engravings. We looked at them, and they didn't mean anything. They're very tiny, black and white. And because they were inside a glass cabinet, at the bottom, they were very hard to see. But She was putting Her face right against the glass of the cabinet to see those illustrations. Mother saw each and every illustration, those tiny little ones. There are even some great Blake scholars who absolutely admire Blake and like everything about Blake, they dedicate their lives to him. And when it comes to these Virgil illustrations, some of them have said, "Oh, these illustrations are a bit overrated."

But not for Mother. They were not overrated at all. Mother liked them all. She saw each and every one. And She kept telling us, "Check the vibrations of these engravings, these little tiny ones. Check these vibrations, this is amazing. These are extraordinary." Luckily for us, nowadays, some modern scholars have shown much more appreciation for these Virgil illustrations than some earlier scholars had. And in fact, nowadays, they've established that they're the most influential work of his lifetime. There was no other work Blake did that influenced so many painters to follow that style. Blake had a group of disciples, painters who had such admiration for him. And for that group of people, there was nothing Blake ever painted or engraved as great as these Virgil illustrations. So this is a type of knowledge that is only for Shri Mataji or great, great experts. Those people who called themselves "the Ancients," they understood something, and Mother proved them right by saying, "This is absolutely extraordinary."

This inspired me to have another look at these illustrations one day. And once I had a chance to read the poem that the illustrations are for, written very nicely by an English poet who translated it from Latin to English, you can see the whole poem is about Sahaja Yoga, especially in the way that William Blake illustrated it. The whole story is about Sahaja Yoga. And as always, Blake is a Sahaja. Mother appreciates everything he does because it is actually about Sahaja Yoga. It's quite easy for us to also do the same: go into meditation, enjoy those vibrations, and benefit as much as possible from that.

Then one day, when new people ask us, "What is this William Blake? Why is he so important? Where does it say that he is a prophet of Sahaja Yoga?" Sometimes new people will ask us that at a public program. It happened to me once. A new person, he knew quite a lot about William Blake, and they said, "What did William Blake write that prophesied about Sahaja Yoga? Where is that prophecy? Where is it written?"

In fact, the answer is so simple. It's the easiest one to find. Because of everything Blake wrote, the most famous thing he wrote is the hymn called "Jerusalem," and "did those feet in ancient time." This is a very famous poem in four stanzas that Blake wrote. And at the end of this poem, there's a line of text where Blake wrote, "Would to God that all the Lord's people were Prophets." So this is where William Blake prophesied that Sahaja Yogis would become prophets too, with powers to make other prophets.

Then people have a tendency to ask, "But where is that aspect Mother said of 'with powers to make other prophets'? Because this is not written literally." Yes, this is the truth. It's not written literally, but that's the actual meaning if you do the correct interpretation. Because when Blake wrote, "Would to God that all the Lord's people were Prophets," he also put the Bible quote. It is actually from the book of Numbers in the Bible, in the Old Testament, chapter 11, verse 29. So if you care to go and read the book of Numbers in the Bible, in chapter 11, what do you have? You have a situation where Moses feels he cannot handle being the leader of all these people in the desert because they are complaining, moaning, and groaning. There was an incident where they started asking for better food and more food, and now they want to eat meat in the desert. Moses got so upset that he went to God and said, "I don't know if I can manage this on my own, if I had at least one more prophet to help me out here."

In the book of Numbers, God gives an answer. "I will not give you just one more prophet, or three, or seven. I will give you 70 extra prophets if you need. So select the best 70 people that you admire and appreciate, the best elders, the most sensible people. Bring them to the tent of the tabernacle," or depending on the translation of the Bible you read, "the tent of meeting." "And then you put the spirit that is in you, and you put the spirit into them. They shall prophesy, and they will all become prophets."

So this is a situation of collective Self-Realization en masse. This is about Sahaja Yoga. This is what we Sahaja Yogis can do. We can also give Self-Realization en masse; we can take that spirit that is in us and pass it on to another person, like Moses did on that occasion, because he needed 70 extra prophets. William Blake prophesied that this would happen in England, in Jerusalem, because this quote that William Blake gave us comes immediately after that big hymn he wrote about building Jerusalem in England. This is about establishing Sahaja Yoga in England. And how do we do that? We do that by giving Self-Realization en masse, just like Moses did.

Blake gave us the actual, very precise quote of the Book of Numbers, chapter 11, verse 29, because there was a little incident. Moses had a disciple called Joshua, and Joshua came to report to Moses, "Look, out of those 70 people, two of them never came to the tent to receive the spirit. But they have started to prophesy as well now. So we must stop them." That's what Joshua is telling Moses. "Why don't you stop them? Because they did not appear in the tent at the right time." And yet they just caught it somehow and started to prophesy. And then Moses replies to Joshua, "Are you jealous on my behalf or what? Let them also become prophets. Would to God that all the Lord's people become prophets."

So that's how this incident came about. And that's the total interpretation when you put the hymn "Jerusalem" together with this quote, together with this episode from chapter 11 of the Book of Numbers. Moses doesn't want to be the only prophet. Moses wants more prophets. And he's even saying, "Would to God that all the Lord's people became prophets." This is, according to Mother, where William Blake wrote that Sahaja Yogis would become prophets and that they would have powers to make other prophets too. So it's all there in writing. It is so very easy to find.

Shri Mataji said to us in a talk, more than once, "What does it mean to be a prophet after all? In Sahaja Yoga, what does it mean to be a prophet?" And then, She answered the question. "It's very simple. A prophet means a person who can feel the all-pervading power of God in his hands. If you can feel the all-pervading power of God in your hands, then you are a prophet." That's what it means to be a prophet in Sahaja Yoga. We have all felt that power in our hands and above our heads. And we have all given realization to people en masse, sometimes at public programs. So it is true. We have all become prophets as prophesied by William Blake.

Even William Blake explained when people asked him what a prophet is. He said a prophet is not a person who foresees the future. It has nothing to do with that. In fact, Blake says that there are no prophets in the modern sense of the word, because even the old prophets were not able to foresee the future totally. At least most of the time they didn't. They could not get the future right. That's up to God. It's not about foreseeing the future. It's something else. Blake explains it is about feeling the truth in your heart and expressing it. That is more related to being a prophet than to foreseeing the future. But Mother gives a very special definition of a prophet, and that's the best one for us. We become prophets the moment we are able to feel the all-pervading power of God in our hands, which we all do thanks to Mother.

We can feel it now coming from Mother's feet, coming from Mother's shoes, coming from Mother's photos, coming from Shri Mataji. Coming even from the paintings of William Blake. We can even feel the vibrations coming from the poems of William Blake, in fact. So we are spoiled for choice. We can feel the vibrations coming from all the deities, from the swyambhus, from everything. Mother has proved this so well that there's just no room for doubt anymore. We have all achieved that state, and we can share it with new people. I think that's more or less the things I wanted to share for today. I apologize if it's not very clear, and thank you for your time and patience.

Jai Shri Mataji.
