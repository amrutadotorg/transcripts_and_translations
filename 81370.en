Jai Shri Mataji, Edward.

Interviewer: Jai Shri Mataji. Hello, how are you?

Yes, we're good, thanks.

Interviewer: And thank you so much for joining us from Vienna in Austria while we are here in England on what seems to be a very nice and pleasant summer's day. Thank you for joining and sharing with us your absolutely phenomenal times with Shri Mataji. This is a beautiful photo that seems to be near the start of your journey. Could you please talk to us about when you got your realization and what the meeting with Shri Mataji was like when you first met her? It's so beautiful to see Shri Mataji holding the flower and you are just with folded hands, greeting her. What was it like?

Actually, this photo came a lot later. Somehow I guess I recognized her even though I had a lot of damage. My first experiences getting realization were just in Canada when Sahaja Yoga was brand new. So there were only seven of us, I think, and not much vibrations yet established. But in fact, in my first experience, I just had pain in my back. I just recognized Shri Mataji. I think I had just enough light in my heart to know, finally, after a decade of seeking and all kinds of terrible things.

My time in Sahaja Yoga had, you could say, two phases. The first was the first four years in Vancouver, from April '82 until Shri Mataji married me in Ganapatipuli, the first time in Ganapatipuli, at the end of '85. And then I began a whole new chapter because we were very limited there, and you could say our experience was limited. Shri Mataji did visit once after I got realization.

In fact, I saw her for the first time in India at the beginning of '83. I was in Bombay. I arrived all alone in the middle of the tour with a big, heavy suitcase. I had never traveled before. All the other Canadian yogis were there—all four of them. But it was an interesting experience because I guess I just felt that sort of doubtlessness about Shri Mataji. I arrived there at two in the morning, and I think there were about 100 yogis in Bombay at that time. All the foreigners were sleeping in this marriage house on two levels.

The next day, they said somebody was getting married. I didn't know it was Menakshi Pai and her husband because he had to go back to work. The weddings were going to be in Delhi. So, my first time seeing Shri Mataji was at this special ceremony for one couple in this marriage hall. I could see Shri Mataji sitting at the front in the audience. There were two tours, so I was there just at the end of the first tour. And then we had the whole experience with Delhi that year. There were all these public programs at different locations for different chakras, and there was a Shivaratri in '83 in the old temple, which was just brand new at the time.

I was totally new. We were seven yogis, so I didn't have the experience of all these numbers. I have fond memories also of the English riding the train from Bombay to Delhi. Everybody will remember Mio; he was a Serbian yogi in London. We became buddies; he sort of took me under his wing. The Shivaratri was amazing because I went back eight or nine years later and the whole area was built up with houses all around, and it was all sort of dirty and the ashram was different. But I had the memory that it was very big with lots of people, like hundreds of people. Then I went back eight years later and it was just a tiny room with a balcony on top. We must have been maybe a hundred yogis—the foreigners and the Indians, the few yogis of Delhi.

One special thing happened at the puja. I was very new in Sahaja Yoga. I was sitting in front of Shri Mataji with my back against the wall. I remembered it as being far away, and it was only about six meters away. The ladies were doing something at her feet; I didn't know what they were doing in the puja. She had this white robe on. I was sitting there watching her face, and she looked at the wall above my head. Then she looked into my eyes. I had an electric shock. I thought, "Oh, I think Shri Mataji has just worked on me." And later it occurred to me, "Oh my God, this was the middle of the Shiva puja. Shiva was looking into me." I was quite new and naive at the time. Of course, I appreciated it. I appreciated everything that was happening.

Interviewer: So this is the Shivaratri Puja in 1983 at Safdarjung Ashram?

Yeah, it was there. This photo was later. This was in my second phase when I lived in Vienna and I was happily married. The first four years were actually difficult because we were a small group. You could say it was the Sahaja Yoga equivalent of the Wild West where anything went. The leader kicked me out twice because I had bad vibrations. Somehow, like I say, I think I just knew who Shri Mataji is. Somebody told me in the beginning that she's the Mother of Christ, Mother Mary. I remember going home and telling my mom, "Shri Mataji is Mother Mary." I don't think she understood what I was saying.

Interviewer: Amazing. So what did you make of it? You mentioned it was your first time traveling abroad, and you come to India. Your only focal point, obviously, is Shri Mataji, who you recognized in your heart. What did you make of it all as a seeker at that point when you hadn't deep-dived into Sahaja Yoga?

Well, when I got my realization in the first ashram in Vancouver, I went home. Unfortunately, I'd been doing TM for eight years. But somehow Shri Mataji put something into my life that was the key help for me to find reality. I don't know if you've heard of I Ching; it's an ancient Chinese oracle. I had just started using it a few months before, and I knew it worked. The first thing I did when I got home was open the I Ching and ask about Shri Mataji. It was the most fantastic thing.

So the next morning, instead of doing my 20 minutes of TM, I looked at my watch, put Shri Mataji's black and white picture there, and just sat like that for 20 minutes. Within two weeks, I stopped doing all the drugs and everything I'd been doing, and I moved away from everything.

So yeah, already in the beginning, it was interesting for people who did heavy drugs. I used to do LSD sometimes, and sometimes in the trip, you go into this paranoia and you'd just be freaking out for hours. There's no way to get out of that. Shortly after my realization, one time I did LSD, and this fear started coming. I just thought of Shri Mataji's face for a split second, and the fear went away. I thought, "Oh, my God, that is amazing." I had all these various experiences in the beginning.

Actually, the first time I was literally kicked out, I had my own place. I was going to work every day. Looking back, because I always felt I was sort of a victim, but looking back now after all my life experience, I feel like it was the most perfect thing that could have happened to me. Shri Mataji said once, "It's good in the beginning to be fanatical because you have to hold on with all your force." I didn't talk to anyone at work. I slept on the hard floor. I made a big altar that I slept in front of. I did a puja by myself every weekend. Basically, I just had Shri Mataji. I had nobody else in the world.

That happened a second time again after I was called back. So literally, I had this experience of just having Shri Mataji and nobody else. At the end of the second time, when they sort of called me back, the leader suggested maybe I could go down and see Shri Mataji, who happened to be in California. This was May '85. There are videos of the Devi Puja at the end of May '85. We were all sleeping at Dr. Warlick’s house. Shri Mataji was in one bedroom, the men were in the living room, and the ladies were in another bedroom. I remember one morning I was eating something in the kitchen and the bedroom door opened. She would sit in the evening and talk to us in the living room, but I immediately put down my food. It was Shri Adi Shakti standing in the bedroom. She turned her head towards the kitchen, she saw me, and she went like this. I was just flabbergasted.

After a few more days, she did programs in San Diego. She said, "Let's have a puja," because they started a new ashram there. All these people that became big leaders were just young, freshly married. And I was there in their midst. She had this living room puja with about 25 people. So, for the one time in my 43 years in Sahaja Yoga, I was actually washing her foot in puja, massaging the foot while they were pouring water. You can see in the video—I took a clip out of me—I was totally in another realm. It was like I had gone from zero to a million in just a few days. When I bowed down and sat up, she said, "Very good." Then I sat up and she said, "Just keep smiling like that." I think it had been a long time since I was smiling.

Then she worked on people. In the old days, she used to work on each person afterwards, and part of it is on the recording. But I think the battery of the camera must have died just at the part where she told me the key thing. I expected a huge list of things that I would have to work on, but she just said twice, "Don't feel guilty. And just meditate regularly."

Interviewer: This is Devi Puja 1985 in San Diego. Oh, brilliant. That's such a beautiful thing that Shri Adi Shakti is actually telling you firsthand what to do.

While I was washing her feet, because I had spent two periods alone focused on the protocol, I remembered that Ganesha is in the heel of the foot. So I kept doing her heel, thinking, "Oh, I hope this pleases Shri Ganesha." I didn't know I was getting totally bathed in the full blast of it.

Interviewer: So after this blissful experience and you've had your time out, you're now established, you're happily married and ascending in the spiritual life. Were there any miracles that happened that you'd like to share with us, please, in this duration? In the early '80s to late '80s?

I think basically, looking back, our life was just a series of continuous miracles. I don't know how; I guess all the Sahaja Yogis must have made good choices in past lives and got all these punyas. That's why we're allowed to recognize her and worship her.

I arrived in Europe, in Austria, with all these full-on yogis and a huge collective. It was interesting for me because for the first four years I was being watched all the time. Suddenly I arrived in this collective where nobody was watching me, and I was happily married. Shri Mataji was arriving for the '86 Guru Puja in Austria on this beautiful lake setting. My wife was making the puja crown, and I found some little job; I'd made some little Ganesha badges for everyone. It was just full speed from then on. I had been four years in Sahaja Yoga; my wife had been two years.

Suddenly, four yoginis were looking after Shri Mataji in the little rented place she had near the lake for the puja. There was Sabina, my wife, and two other yoginis, and they were cooking for her and everything. Afterwards, in Vienna, Shri Mataji said that my wife and her sister should accompany her to Munich. So suddenly they were on the train with Shri Mataji. There were public programs in Munich and this Kartikeya Puja, this very famous puja. That's sort of where I ran into my wife next time, in Munich.

Shri Mataji used the early yogis to do many things. Somehow my wife turned out to be an artist, and she was still in school at the time. I was just turning 28 when we got married, and she was 26. I came from Vancouver six months later, just in time for this big puja in Austria.

A funny story is that Brigitte and her sister got an inheritance from their grandmother after they came to Sahaja Yoga. You see them in the videos in England, at a train station or at some seminar. They basically went to everything where Shri Mataji was. That's how my wife could afford to go to India for the first time for a marriage.

Then two guys in Vienna said, "Shri Mataji bought a house in England, in Shudy Camps. We're going for the first puja, the Bhumi Devi Puja." My wife said, "Why don't you go with them?" I said, "Okay." It was a 14 or 16-hour drive. I remember the experience there, the first big gathering in Shudy Camps. I guess in a way, everybody in England was used to Shri Mataji being around all the time. She had gone upstairs and I think food was being served. I couldn't really get into the chatting and the food. I was standing at the bottom of the stairs going, "Oh my God, Shri Adi Shakti is up the stairs. Oh my God. Oh my God." I was just standing there; I couldn't get out of this awe.

The next year, I ended up working there for several weeks. She was helping with the cornicing, doing the gold, and I was helping John Watkinson tile the many bathrooms. I used that later in life and became a tiler.

When you talk about miracles, looking back, we were just full-on the whole time with Shri Mataji. It was like twice a month we were seeing Shri Mataji and hearing her say new things. Whoever went would bring that back to the collective. We were living in various ashrams and everybody was just focused.

But something happened in '89. Just before that, I had gone to Finland to help start Sahaja Yoga there with another guy. Then in the middle of '89, I went to Turkey for the first time, and me and Akbar helped establish the new people there. Just before that, in our ashram, somebody had moved out, so we had this big bedroom. Before the birthday puja, I set up all these tables with paper and paints and crayons. Everybody from the collective was invited to make pages for a huge card for Shri Mataji's birthday. In the middle of that, I suddenly got overwhelmed with something. Something in me opened—the creativity and the collectivity. I went to Shri Mataji's picture and said, "Shri Mataji," on one of these rare occasions where you just know she's listening. I was normally very nervous around Shri Mataji. I said, "We really need money. We could do so many things for spreading Sahaja Yoga and beauty and sharing your love." I didn't put these two things together until 20 years later.

Towards the end of '89, Shri Mataji saw my wife at the Diwali puja somewhere. She saw her as she was leaving the puja and said, "Oh, can you phone me?" So Brigitte didn't know what to do. She was working at the time in a 200-year-old porcelain factory, and they didn't have cell phones then. At lunchtime, she went to the porter at the main door and asked to use the phone. She phoned Shri Mataji at her home in London, and Shri Mataji said she had 50 oil paintings she wanted to give us to somehow start an art business.

Just before that, in August, was the first time Shri Mataji was in Russia. For Brigitte's graduation, her father bought her a new car, so we went to all the pujas that summer. I just saw the interview video of us at Milan airport in August '89. I realized we arrived in Milan for the puja at Lake Como. From there, we drove to the Ganesha puja in Switzerland. From there, we drove through the night—there were two vehicles, one from Rome—all the way to Helsinki for the first public program there. Then we drove to Leningrad and Moscow. It was full-on the whole time.

Then we got home. Brigitte's sister was still in Moscow, and she called Brigitte and said, "Shri Mataji said you guys should move to Frankfurt, Germany." So we said, "Okay, we're moving to Frankfurt." I immediately got a job there. Suddenly, this happened at the Diwali puja. Brigitte had to pick me up from Frankfurt, and we drove to Shudy Camps where Shri Mataji was packing to move to Pratisthan. This was towards the end of '89. Yogis were there helping in Shudy Camps.

We had to go up to this little room in front of her bedroom where somebody was unpacking all these paintings she had bought. She told us she wanted us to create an art business in Vienna. In Vienna, she always said that the Saraswati Tattva was so strong because everything is very ornate. Mozart lived there, and it's just like a jewel box. It was her idea that we could do this art business. That was the first time I was ever confident enough to speak to Shri Mataji because normally I was too nervous. A moment came where I didn't realize if she was talking about Vienna or Frankfurt. So I said, "Shri Mataji, should we do it in Vienna or Frankfurt?" And she said, "Vienna." Later, I was so glad that I remembered to ask that, because I would have had no idea where we were supposed to do it.

Interviewer: We were sort of on the miracle subject, but yeah, there were so many events. Actually, I'm writing them all down now, finally.

Yes. I know some yogis pass away and then they don't really share all these memories. I don't really have an excuse because I'm a writer.

Interviewer: Amongst the various talents you have, writing is one of them. We bought your Edward series, "Okidoki," and read it to our children when they were little.

Oh, really? Yeah.

Interviewer: Because not just writing, I think you write poetry as well.

Yeah, and I did drawings and music and carpentry.

Interviewer: Yes, I remember you were doing the decks way back for the children to play, that play area in Cabella.

In Cabella, yeah. Actually, I just bought a whole bunch of wood to do some repairs this time when I go. It's a never-ending thing. It's a work in progress.

Interviewer: Tell us about these magical times with Shri Mataji. We just enjoy the vibrations when you share, and we just have a joy out of it. What must it have been like, being in her presence 24/7?

It's funny you mention 24/7 because early in 1997, I said to somebody, "Sahaja Yoga is getting really big now and Shri Mataji can't have private audiences anymore. It's just too much. She's constantly traveling and so many important people to meet." Then around June, there used to always be some puja in America, and I used to take the Austrians. One yogini worked for Austrian Airlines, so she'd get a group booking. I'd get all the names, collect all the money, and then bring them over to my side of the world.

In '97, that happened, and then I came back. Somebody said they needed help in the castle, doing the facade. It was a huge job. So I said, "Okay, I'll go." I got there, and Shri Mataji arrived shortly later from America. She said she was sick from working out America, and she ended up staying there for five months in the castle with no traveling. We were sleeping six meters below her. There were about 10 or 12 of us guys working every day, six days a week. After that, I never made any proclamations. Adi Shakti can do anything.

I had one nice experience there. I had the idea that it would be nice to have a movie evening once a week. Brigitte had brought her whole collection of movies on cassette tapes. I'd make a poster and say, "Tonight, Star Wars, part one, and popcorn and Coca-Cola will be served." All the guys, wow, after dinner, we'd gather. Then one time, Sandeep came downstairs and said Sadna Didi was looking for movies, if anybody had any by any chance. I said, "Oh, I have some movies." Brigitte didn't only bring the cool movies for workers; we had a collection of Audrey Hepburn. So I said, "Oh, maybe Shri Mataji would like these." He took them up, and about a week later, he brought them back and said, "Congratulations, Shri Mataji really enjoyed it." It was really heart-opening, just one of these little moments.

Another time at that point was Diwali '97. It was a huge construction site, and of course, it was very ugly. She was arriving back from Portugal. Over the bridge, there was scaffolding, and I had the idea, why don't we get some lights or cloth from the castle and decorate? We decorated it all and made a "Happy Diwali" sign. Shri Mataji arrived, got out of the car and said, "Oh, Diwali. Diwali is here also." The only mistake I made was I was standing inside the door trying to blow the conch, and it was making this terrible noise. Everybody was standing nervously because I kept trying. Somebody said, "You better stop." So that was a little bit of humor in that. But it was an amazing period.

We kept having situations like that, working in the castle. A couple of years later, they were redoing Shri Mataji's bedroom, and Brigitte was doing the gold on the cornicing. The work at Shudy Camps was mind-boggling because there were people from all over the world. At the end, we were working night shifts also, 24 hours, seven days a week, like a relay. When you look back, you can't even imagine what motivated you, because you just got so much joy and bliss from Shri Mataji. You wouldn't even question doing anything. You just went as often as you could to see her, as often as you could to go to India, and then, of course, to prepare a house for her.

By the end, the vibrations were so strong. Just before the Guru Puja in '86, they were actually rolling the carpet in front of her bedroom to finish it as she was coming up the stairs. At the last minute. You just go thoughtless thinking about it. Then there were all those pujas there, and I love rewatching those pujas because she's so full of this motherly humor that she always has. Especially in England, she always had this humor and this motherly quality, and you'd get all the English laughing.

Interviewer: From what you were telling about the movies that Shri Mataji watched, it was then that she said Roman Holiday is one of the good movies.

Yeah, exactly. She loved that movie. We just happened to have it.

Interviewer: I was with Shri Mataji a couple of times when she watched movies.

Which ones?

Interviewer: In Vienna, they would get the presidential suite of the really old palace hotels. I remember now there was one called The Elephant Man. It was about somebody who was deformed and had a hard time. I remember not seeing it with her, but hearing about The Matrix. Imagine how human minds can grasp that concept of reality, that it's actually just an illusion.

One thing I referred to recently to somebody, because there's all this happening with artificial intelligence, was when she started watching 2001: A Space Odyssey. I think she got them to stop the movie when Hal, the computer, took over, because she said if it comes to that, then it's really bad.

Interviewer: I remember when we were recording Golden Memories at Blossom Farm in 2010, Patti Prohl, bless her, she shared the same thing. Shri Mataji mentioned, if we allow the computers, then they'll take over. And that's the end of it, this artificial intelligence. Very useful, but...

Actually, I read just a few weeks ago that Shri Mataji said that... I recently read all the memory books. I always compare where I was at the time when somebody was writing about where she was and what was going on. No, I forget. The vibrations are getting too strong now. I can't even think anymore.

But the memory books are fantastic. The recollections are amazing. Reading them gives so much joy. Even when you read it on social media or somebody's forwarded that info, you get hold of the book again and it's like, wow, you're taken into another realm, isn't it? You can imagine that hundreds of years from now, people will be reading these.

Interviewer: But that's the idea of doing these Golden Memories, because you and the others are yogis who had that real time with Shri Mataji. People in the future might like to know what it was like to be with her. We don't have adequate words to describe it, do we? I remember when we used to be in her physical presence, the levels of joy were completely different. It was phenomenal. And although the vibrations are so strong even now, there is something which has completed, sort of thing. Do you feel that?

I think unconsciously or subconsciously, the yogis worry that it's going to go off like the other religions, because we have memories of that from our past lives. But Shri Mataji said that the Param Chaitanya is so established that Shri Sadashiva is pleased and the world won't be destroyed. I just listened to a talk where she described everything. I never heard this one before; she actually goes into detail and explains exactly what happened. But at some point she said that this world won't be destroyed, which makes me feel, well, how many will be left? That's the main point.

Then you feel that so many yogis just left because they had bad feelings with other people. It was mainly personality conflicts, I think, that most people left the Sangha. I could understand in a way how that could happen, but from my experience, maybe because Shri Mataji had me sent out early on, I had never let go of the collective.

Another good point that I realized through all my difficulties is that you have to go through your karmas and your punyas. You have to go through whatever you've earned. But I have the feeling the main thing about all these difficulties is that God has given us complete freedom, so we can do whatever we want. She can't control us. But on the other side of the ego is the conditioning, the superego. So she creates events that sort of bring our ego down, just by making us beg because we're suffering or having fear. It's very valuable, actually, to go through things because from my own experience, it brings the ego down. You're just in a state where every little drop that you get, you're just grateful for it. And gratitude is the quality of Sahasrara. So, in a way, people suffering is not very nice, but it's so valuable to go through these things just to keep you solid, holding on to Shri Mataji.

Interviewer: It's all part of the ascent, isn't it? It's like this belief that Shri Mataji gives us the tests that she knows we can emerge out victorious from, hopefully.

Actually, I don't even use the word "test." I always consider them as exercises. I have training programs to keep my body fit because I'm getting older—I'm 67 now—so I have to do something regularly. All the things that happen, I feel like they are phases. I write these things down, and you can see, "Aha, I had to go through this, repeat it, repeat it, and then I got quite good at it." I was at a different level, and then I had to go through something more. So it's basically just exercises that you get better and better at.

Interviewer: Is there some exercises that were more useful than the others in Sahaj terms for you?

I go thoughtless. When I think what Shri Mataji put me through, right from the beginning, I was just born into this crazy situation of alcoholism and the most intense scariness, even before birth and after. I think one of the first things that comes to mind is you already decided that you wanted this, at any cost. She said, "Well, if you want to get really grounded in it, especially if you go through difficulty, that'll make you build up into it." You probably say, "I'll do anything," and then maybe regret it a little bit. But so much pain, the pain of fear and always feeling unsafe all the time, makes you hold on to Shri Mataji so tightly.

I've known a couple of leaders who had terrible childhoods also, and you could feel the insecurity in them, but their dedication was increased through it. It's not like a person that has a perfect, smooth life is going to be better off. The main thing that I realized, because if you carry these damages in you from childhood, at some point you get older and they come out physically. So at some point I got sick, and then I was getting sicker. I was feeling desperate. I thought it would just sort of fade away and heal somehow, but it became even more dramatic. At the end of many years, I was rushed to the hospital and I almost died.

I was able to watch this whole thing. I had a fear of death all my life, and then suddenly I got over it because in these 48 hours that I was dying, I thought, "Oh, it's not so bad. I get to go to Shri Mataji." I really felt that. Sometimes people feel like God is looking the other way, but I felt, "Well, here she is with me. I'll just watch what happens." Of course, I was saved in the end, and it was very dramatic.

Afterwards, I was still feeling a bit bad about myself, and then Shri Mataji just sent me this thing. Because I'm a writer, I write stories. And she said, "You know, actually it's all a story. She's just creating it for Shri Sadashiva, and he's just there enjoying it." He enjoys every blade of grass and he enjoys our conversation now. I was so worried about not spreading Sahaja Yoga 24/7. Some old Indian yogini told me, "There are different jobs in Sahaja Yoga. Not everybody goes out all the time and raises Kundalinis. Some people help Sahaja Yogis," or like my wife, she's doing all this art, Ganeshas that are going all over the world. At that point, I realized it helped because I could see everything in the light of that great story principle. It took care of everything, because she's directing and producing and watching us, how we're coming along. And Shri Sadashiva is there, enjoying every little triumph.

Interviewer: Tell us, we're going back again to when Shri Mataji gave you and Brigitte those oil paintings. What happened from there on? How did that pan out for you guys?

Actually, that was in Shudy Camps she gave us the painting. The next day we were staying with Hesta and David, and she phoned Hesta and gave a suggestion for Brigitte to paint porcelain doorknobs. To that detail, she was thinking about what we could do. About 20 years later, I connected this whole event to when I talked to her photo and said we need money to spread the love, the beauty, and the art.

From another memory story, somebody else at that time didn't know he was an artist—I don't know if you know Steve Jones. He was just doing some biology or something, and Shri Mataji said, "You should become an artist." His story is amazing. He just thought, "Okay," and then he applied to all these big graphic art companies without a portfolio or anything and said, "I'd like an interview. I'm going to be an artist." Eventually, he was hired by a company. So I had the feeling, ah, maybe Shri Mataji was sort of working on this yogi artist thing at the time.

Unfortunately, we took all the paintings back to Vienna and sold them to the yogis in the ashram. We had a painting sale weekend. I wanted to take the money back to Shri Mataji at the 1990 Brighton Easter puja, I think. She said, "No, you're supposed to sell them to non-yogis," to get vibrations. Of course, the yogis pounced on it. She didn't accept the money. She told us to go to the shop in London where she bought them and buy more and then continue.

For years, we had a location in Vienna, and our baby was born at the same time, so it was another magical time. Later Shri Mataji told Brigitte that she'd like to visit the shop. When I saw Shri Mataji in Delhi in '92, I think, she said, "Sir CP just got an export license and they can send us things from India." I just found my diary a couple of months ago with that conversation. Anyway, that didn't actually happen, and later the shop was closed because we moved to North America.

But she would give us advice. Luckily, Brigitte's sister was married in Delhi to Deepak Mehta, so we had this connection. We were importing semi-precious stones, and in the late '80s and '90s, there were these modern Punjabis, and we were selling those and lacquer boxes. We got these big crates full of stuff. It wasn't a very good location, so it was more of a hobby in a way. But looking back, it was preparation also, because Brigitte became more and more successful with her artworks.

Shri Mataji said we should exhibit in cities in Europe, and she mentioned Frankfurt and London, which Brigitte eventually did in group exhibitions. It's funny, I just finished reading Duilio's book, and he explains he was with Shri Mataji like every day for years. In 1999, Shri Mataji did drawings for a hotel in the Cabella camp, and a restaurant to serve non-yogis, and an area with stands for selling handicrafts and artworks near the Hangar. The Molino would have become a hotel. In 2007, the foundation decided, based on Shri Mataji's early wish, they would implement this idea. All these stands started where people could sell things. That was lucky; that was when we started selling the Ganeshas and the Hanumans in Cabella. It's been 18 years now that we've had a stand there.

It's a really interesting experience because I get to stand there for several days and meet yogis from all over the world in a different atmosphere. I've basically been at all the summer pujas for 18 years. Another thing that was interesting for me is to see people's faces when they come and see all these handmade things that are radiating something. People would just go still, or they'd come back again and again. It's very valuable for yogi artists to know that what they're doing has vibrations. I do a lot of things with woodwork, and I never remember that I'm putting vibrations into it. It's important that yogi artists realize that whatever's coming out of their hands is carrying vibrations. It might be around for hundreds of years that people will be feeling vibrations from them.

Interviewer: Yes, she has given us that blessing to be the saints if we want to be, being her children and her instruments. We should be aware of the impact because of Shri Mataji through us. So, you've talked about the pujas and Havan. How do you find them now compared to when you first came to Sahaja Yoga without much background information?

A few months after I came to Sahaja Yoga, the first yogis of Canada did a historic trip. They drove over 5,000 kilometers across North America to visit Shri Mataji when she came to New York. Then they drove all the way back. At that point, the leader said to me, "Hey, Ed, you want to caretake the ashram while we're gone?" I said, "Sure, why not?" I was alone in the ashram the whole weekend. I found all those Amar Chitra comic books and I read them all. I found out all about the deities. What a treat.

We were so lucky in the beginning. Most people don't realize that Felicity Payman is basically the grandmother of Sahaja Yoga in Canada. She came over and she had had years with Shri Mataji in London. Plus, she had the connection; she would phone friends, or tapes would be sent over. We got all our information through Felicity. In the ashram, every morning at five or six, we did a two-and-a-half-hour puja with a thousand names and all the elements. Every day. Then Shri Mataji mentioned in '82, "Every Thursday, the yogis should stay up all night for their Guru Tattva." So, we went, "Oh, okay," and we did that also.

At my mom's place when I first started, I just had this little black and white photo. They gave me a laminated photo of Shri Mataji's feet and said I should keep it under my pillow. So I would get up in the morning, put the picture there, pour some water on it, and read her 108 names, which brings back memories from 43 years ago.

I had a breakthrough about 12 years ago when I first got sick. It was a traumatic experience that made a breakthrough because I guess you get into a comfort zone. I had worked on something very creative, put my whole soul into it, and an old yogi said, "No, that's very bad." I just decided in that moment, "Oh my God, I didn't know," and I threw it away. It was like ripping my heart out. I got sick immediately. A couple of weeks later, I thought, why don't we just check vibrations? My wife and I check with little pieces of paper with "yes" or "no." Luckily, she's really good at feeling Kundalini. We checked about it, and I was really worried. It said, "No, I should continue with it exactly the way it is. It's perfectly fine."

I had been in Sahaja Yoga for 35 years or something, and I suddenly had a breakthrough. I had been writing about deities, and they said, "Don't write about deities, that's really bad." Hanuman, who is sort of a jolly angel, is easy to talk about and feel close to. Suddenly, it was an overwhelming feeling because I thought, "Sri Hanuman liked what I was talking about. Maybe he was even with me and enjoying it." Beings would actually enjoy me and pay attention to me. I was so overwhelmed, I burst out crying and laughing. I couldn't stop. I was just sobbing, and I felt so much joy. That was sort of a breakthrough where I had this connection to the deities. Because of the guilt in me, I felt they're too big; you can never get close to them. Suddenly I felt they have so much affection for us also. As long as we're her children and we love her, they just enjoy that inside of us. It was just such a joy to feel that they have this affection for us.

Interviewer: It's very important to hear that as well, because we carry on with our everyday lives and somehow that mundaneness takes over that subtle reality. And it becomes a little bit mechanical somehow.

I know. Luckily, one of the biggest miracles in Sahaja Yoga for me is just being married to a yogini wife who's just full-on, thinking about Shri Mataji all day. When we're not sort of goofing around like children, we're talking about how some vibrations change and what that must mean. The focus is how we can get more of Shri Mataji and get closer to her. Every tiny breakthrough that we get is really exciting.

Interviewer: So it's really very interesting how you came to Sahaja Yoga, then Shri Mataji married you and your son Lincoln was born. You wrote stories for him, which other yogis read to their children. And now your son is married recently.

Yeah, he just got married. As a teenager, he was sort of half in Sahaja Yoga, but then he moved away for many years for university. I think you have the feeling with many of the yuvas, they're born realized and they don't have any comparison to what it's like not to be. The first yogis were a bit fanatical and very careful not to make mistakes. They feel bogged down by this sometimes. One thing our son said is we'd warn him that non-yogis can have negative vibrations, and he said he always disliked that because he felt love for everybody. Anyway, they experiment and go out and try whatever. But I think he still has Shri Mataji, he still has respect for Shri Mataji.

So he met this girl spontaneously, and she also was like a yogini, I think, probably also born realized and felt everything. Even though they don't meditate or do any of the things that Sahaja yogis do, that respect and that awe is sort of there. And of course, she feels it in us also. She said again and again, she's so grateful to have parents-in-law like us. She doesn't know it's because we have this source for our hope. That's another blessing. You just see if you hold on and keep going, that things gradually improve. I told a yogi recently, "If you want to see what your state is, just look around you." Most people in the world are struggling and have very difficult circumstances. We, the yogis, look around and everything's quite beautiful and safe. Wow, maybe that means that our inside is like that.

Interviewer: That is truly incredible how the state inside is reflected outside and how Shri Mataji wants us to project and radiate that love that she has given us. Is there any humorous instances that you might like to share that you had with Shri Mataji?

Actually, there was a very humorous one that Brigitte shared. In '86, when she and her sister went with Shri Mataji to Munich, Shri Mataji was working out this dry German side. In the ashram there, somebody had just started an ashram, and they said they were constantly laughing with Shri Mataji. There was them and I think two leaders, and Shri Mataji was trying to speak German. They were all laughing so hard. Shri Mataji was holding her stomach and said, "We have to stop laughing now because my stomach is hurting too much."

The whole time, of course, we're newlyweds, and this was an opportunity for Brigitte to ask Shri Mataji about what to do in Austria, because I was just learning German. At the end, she completely forgot about it after a couple of programs and a puja. Then, we were in this old house, and we were upstairs. Shri Mataji came out of the bedroom, and I was at the top of the stairs. She was just passing me to step down, and she turned to me and she told me everything I should do for working in Austria. Basically, one of the main things that I did end up doing a lot was picture framing, woodwork, which she mentioned again to Brigitte later. She said I could do carving and things like that. And she said I could do painting, like house painting.

Three or four years later, we went to Romania for the first programs there, and Brigitte was again attending to Shri Mataji. When I started doing the picture frames, I think she was thinking of Antonio Schaller, who does everything from scratch. I told her, "Actually, I buy the finished pieces and then I cut them." She started to say, "No, you should buy the equipment and make..." and then the very first Bulgarian yogis walked in the room and she said, "Oh, the Bulgarians have come," so she didn't continue.

The job I got in Frankfurt, when she told my sister-in-law we should move there, was in the oldest picture framing shop in Frankfurt. I had to work out something there because this guy's family were Nazi supporters. The whole time he was saying things, and I'd go home on the bus to the ashram and I'd be crying. My heart was hurting so much.

It took me a long time because I always wanted to do music. Shri Mataji never mentioned it. After another puja in Cabella, a Krishna puja, I'd written a poem about the Kundalini. I asked an actress in Vienna to read it. I was sitting at the back of this huge tent. The person decided not to read it and said, "Why didn't Edward read it?" Suddenly Guido was on the microphone: "Can Ed come forward and read his poem?" I had to go through all the people while Shri Mataji and the whole place waited in silence. I was really nervous. I bowed down first, then went on stage and read it. Afterwards, Shri Mataji saw Brigitte and said, "Oh, your husband was a carpenter. Now he's a poet."

Then in Leningrad that first time, the television came to film her in the afternoon. We also had the Sahaj camera. She said, "No, no, you should go. You're artists. You should go to the museum." I refer to these things—she called me a carpenter, a poet, and an artist—but she never referred to music, even though I was often playing the drums on stage at public programs.

Eventually, I had this thing that I have to do something big with my many talents. Then I realized eventually that Brigitte is coming up; she always encouraged Brigitte. I have all this experience, maybe from past lives, and I'm supposed to be helping her because it's her time. I refer to it as the "Brigitte show," not the "Edward show." An interesting thing happened inside me because I started feeling more satisfied with myself. I realized I don't have to strive to achieve something. Mostly I help her because there's a lot of work to do. She ships out statues all over the world. Or even at home, I always cook dinner, and now I've started cooking breakfast every morning.

Interviewer: It took you a long time to realize?

The funny thing is, way back in the '80s, Jana, who used to live in Bath, did our horoscopes. She told me, "No, what you're really good at would be art marketing." I was traumatized. "No, I have to do art! I don't want to do something dry like that." I just found what she had written last year, and I thought, this is exactly what I'm finally ready to do. That was maybe 33 years later. And then I was ready to accept it. I still do artistic things. I just got an iPad and I've discovered that's a nice element. I'm an Aquarius, and I like to do things with technology and light, sort of like painting with light.

Interviewer: Is there any gifts that Shri Mataji gave you that you treasure?

Actually, our house you could call a present. An old lady, a friend of Brigitte's grandmother, died in 2003. We found out that in '82, the year I came to Sahaja Yoga, she had put Brigitte as her sole inheritor into her will. So already from '82, I guess, it was decided this lady would die and we'd have our own house with a big property.

I have this beautiful little jewel box of a meditation room, and I added some glass door cupboards with lights inside for all the precious things. So basically, we have these two cupboards that have all our wedding things that she gave us. Over the years in Cabella, she would give out presents.

That time in Shudy Camps when she gave us the oil paintings, all these yogis were helping pack her things to send to Bratislava. A yogini came down and said, "You're also supposed to come up. She's giving presents to all the boys." I said, "No, we're just visiting. We didn't do anything." We went up, and by the time I went up, Brigitte was kneeling in front of Shri Mataji. I just sat at the stairs. I just sat on the top step in the back. This is the first time I ever heard Shri Mataji say my name. She said it in a penetrating way that went right through me. She put her head up like this and said, "Edward." I said, "Yes, Shri Mataji." Instead of saying no, I went forward, and she was giving out these watches. So it was double blessings.

At that time in the Frankfurt ashram, I had painted a silk pillow. I heard Shri Mataji liked ochre, so I made the Ganesha ochre and in the background, I did dark blue. I offered it, and she looked and said, "Oh, a good idea of putting blue around Ganesha." I think it represents his mother. She said, "I have so many presents, I don't know what to do. I'm going to have to carry it on my head." And she put it on her Sahasrara.

Nothing really compares to self-realization and thoughtless awareness. All those years in Sahaja Yoga, I could barely meditate. I don't think I really did; I think my heart was just enough there. I would sit to meditate and I guess I would daydream, and I would always feel guilty about it because I could never stop my thinking. Now, especially after these hardships I went through, I can. From childhood, I had so much tension in my body that I couldn't even go into my instrument and experience the Union. I could never go into my body because it had so many horrors locked inside of it. Through this whole thing with getting sick, I started recognizing it and being able to release it. At some point, I felt it's so beautiful inside. It's so big and beautiful and quiet.

So now, at this point, the present given to us is that you could actually just stop anytime and be thoughtless. It was unimaginable for me. And to be able to go into Sahasrara. I noticed it in public; if I'm in a queue at a cashier, people look in my face. I think their nervous system suddenly goes into a wave of peace, and they feel where it's coming from and look into my eyes automatically. That is, for me, the greatest present. Even though I was sort of like a hopeless case in a situation where there was hardly any opportunity to become a yogi, she just sort of plucked me out somehow, knowing all the things I had to go through.

My first time meeting Shri Mataji, I was just so possessed from transcendental meditation and 10 years of drugs, I was shaking. I was in terror. I couldn't go in front of her. Now when I read all the memory books, they're saying in the '80s, the yogis would all come forward and bow at the end of the program. I had one opportunity like that when I first went to Delhi, but I couldn't. Coming from all that and then finally, after decades, just being in a state where I can basically be with Shri Mataji whenever I want is beyond all these little trinkets we collected from her.

Interviewer: Incredible. Were you involved in doing the first public meetings in places with Shri Mataji, and from that experience, would you have any advice for people now and in time to come?

My only experience is really organizing, and in both situations, I was luckily just the helper. That was in Finland and Turkey at the very beginning. In both situations, there was a flat and new people would come every day, and we'd teach them bhajans. I had to learn a lot. In both situations, I was with a very competent yogi who was good at organizing things. The atmospheres were very different: Finland was a Nordic country, and Turkey was Islamic. Luckily Akbar was there, and he knew how to talk to everybody.

In Canada, I was there for the one time she visited while I was in Sahaja Yoga, and I got to drive her. That was great. I had a crazy experience—it's a bit embarrassing. Vancouver was a very beautiful city. They made a park right in the middle of the city with community rooms you could rent. When Shri Mataji did the program there, she said it's good to do it under the earth because it sets vibrations everywhere. They had rented a Lincoln Continental. She stayed in our ashram in a very beautiful location across the water on the mountainside with a view of the ocean. This was September-October '83. My father came to the public program, and my mom came to the ashram. I can't even imagine it now. Shri Mataji at some point looked at her, looked at me, looked at her, looked at me, and must have seen our whole past incarnations.

Me and another boy took turns driving the Lincoln with Shri Mataji. The world leader said when Shri Mataji's in a hurry, it's okay to speed. So we were entering the freeway, and I put the gas down. One evening was the other boy, and the other evening was me. My friends were invited, my dad and everything, and it was so exciting. She was spending a long time inside going through the audience, working on people, and I was outside talking to some friends. Then she came out and talked to the born-realized little girl of my friend. Then she passed with the leaders and went to the lift. Somebody came up and said, "Ed, aren't you supposed to be driving Shri Mataji?"

Oh my God. I ran up the three flights of stairs. The car was not too far away, but it was a one-way road. I came out of this parking lot and reversed it up this road where Shri Mataji was already standing on the sidewalk. The leader told me afterwards that Shri Mataji said, "Oh look, he's coming backwards up the road."

There's another weird situation. Shri Mataji mentioned this on the next cassette we got from London. She invited everyone from the program to come to the ashram for a Navaratri puja, and she cooked for everybody—all the new people. Actually, 50 people ended up coming. This was the first day of Navaratri in October 1983. They ate all the food that she cooked all night. We were coming back at 11 o'clock at night from the program, and some conversation was going on. Suddenly one of the leaders says, "Ed, turn the car around. We have to go to India Town to buy some food. Shri Mataji wants to cook."

So I turned the car around. It was almost midnight. The world leader and our leader went into a restaurant, got some ingredients, and woke up his friend across the street who lived above his shop and got all the rest of the ingredients. She stayed up till six in the morning, I think, cooking for all the new people. I was left in the car with her alone. In Vancouver, she'd always ride in the front seat. She maybe loved to look at everything. I was sitting beside her and I said, "Oh, thank you for the beautiful program, Shri Mataji." Then she took my hand. I think I squeezed her hand; I was so nervous. I couldn't think of anything to say. Then she said, "Maybe you go in and see what they're doing." So I show up in the restaurant: "What are you doing? You left Shri Mataji in the car?" I said, "She told me to come in and see what you're doing!" It was really hard for me because I was so shy.

A month later, the cassettes were always coming from England. Shri Mataji said, "Sometimes the yogis don't listen to me. Like in Vancouver last time, we were driving in the car and I gave instructions and they said, 'No, no, not possible, Shri Mataji is too late.' I felt like taking out a pistol and saying, 'Now stick 'em up! Let's go, I want to get these ingredients!'" I had no idea at the time that was happening.

I went back after seven years, after I got married, and I was basically a new person. It was '93, ten years later. She was having a public program in the same hall. After everybody left, the local yogis gathered around her. A few of us were standing outside the door, and she was coming out with the leaders. She stopped and she saw me and she said, "Oh, you came." Everybody looked at me. Then she was walking to the lift and she said to somebody, "He's Canadian." For me, that was like recognition that I was one of the first. My first job when I got realized was walking the streets of the city writing parking tickets, so I was like a vacuum cleaner every day. Part of that period was when I was completely on my own. I was one of these foundation stones that gets buried in the beginning. So that was my big moment of recognition.

The tour continued. I saw her at the airport and she said, "Are you coming to LA?" I said, "Yes." She said, "Oh good." That was sort of a repeat of my first California experience when I got to wash her feet.

We were at public programs all over the world. My wife just got this brand new car for graduation, and we went everywhere with it, even drove all the way to Moscow. In Finland, there was no car, so the world leader said, "We'll use your car." In Moscow, the program was in a stadium. She comes out to the parking lot and the car that they had hired to bring her there just didn't show up. I was just coming out of the stadium and the leader shouted, "Ed, bring your car!" I have the feeling like Shri Hanuman was carrying me. I ran around the stadium, jumped in the car, brought it around, parked it, and left the doors open. They all got in and took the car.

In many programs, like in Czechoslovakia or Istanbul, I was with musicians on the stage playing my drums. Even at the one program in Vienna at the Royal Palace, a huge, beautiful hall, the Nirmal Sangeet was playing on the stage. I got to play my drum sitting behind them, and the tabla player kept looking at me because we were sort of dueling with each other. I can't even remember all the various programs.

Interviewer: Over these decades, what are the deepest wisdoms and insights that you have gained that could benefit the listeners?

I think the biggest thing for me was this principle of the big story that's going on continually. That made me feel every little tiny thing we do is appreciated by God. The Austrian leader once, we were walking in the woods, and he said, "This bond of love is basically unbreakable. You don't have to worry about anything. You can't really get out of it." So whatever our destiny is, it's a permanent thing.

The feeling that it's all a story and it's being composed every moment, spontaneously, whatever choices we make. There's a basic principle in psychology that people with childhood trauma tend to move either towards affection and anger or towards love, which is healing. The people that move towards love tend to heal, because, as Shri Mataji said, it's like an ellipse; whatever you're sending out comes back. I think that's a mistake a lot of yogis make. Something in their mind tells them that they're justified, and they go off on their own. C.S. Lewis wrote in The Great Divorce about Napoleon, who kept moving further away until he was 10,000 years away. That concept of moving away from the Sangha—oh my God, I couldn't imagine that.

So, just the feeling that you can get that deep satisfaction inside you, that you're all right, you're not guilty, and there's nobody to not forgive. Many people did things to me. I think going back to the question about the greatest presents she gave me, it would be optimism and a sense of humor. Without that, it's really tough to get through, because you always come into the judgmental thing. You get stuck in it, and it's really hard to get out, whether you're judging yourself or others.

I think that's the main thing that helped me. Every day I just remember that, and also that the maya is so thick on purpose that literally we have no idea what's going on. 99.99% of everything that's happening in life is invisible. We just fumble along and stick to it. Even when everything is really thick and you just can't feel anything, you just know, "Ah, it's one of these periods. It will pass."

Interviewer: There were some photos that you wanted to share with us.

Oh, there were a couple more, yeah. Let's see. This one is in Vienna. Shri Mataji came and just stopped at the airport; she didn't do any program. This is when we had a newborn baby. He was about eight weeks old when we brought him to the Navaratri puja in Cabella in the blue circus tent. Afterwards, she was giving names to babies, and we told her that we named him Lincoln. She said, "Oh, what a beautiful name, you should keep it." This must have been just a couple of weeks before that Navaratri, so this is autumn '91.

This looks like the Vienna airport also, this would have been a few years before, judging by the young faces. Brigitte is there on the right side.

Oh, here's the Navaratri puja. Our little baby being held by Shri Mataji. He got so filled with vibrations. And that's Brigitte in front.

This is in Istanbul. I'm not sure what year that would have been. She was also helping Shri Mataji.

And that's in Cabella, that's in the 2000s, I think, from the throne. This is in the Hangar.

Oh, this could be Easter in Turkey, I think.

Interviewer: Beautiful. Thank you so much for sharing these absolutely amazing photographs and the wonderful times with Shri Mataji.

Yes, and the story continues. Shri Mataji said once—I think it was in a dream to somebody after she passed away—she said, "Don't worry, I think I'm going to have to incarnate again because there's so much love, I have to come back." That's so beautiful.

Interviewer: And also, as you were saying, when Shri Mataji said that Sadashiva is pleased with the creation now and it won't be destroyed, with the world affairs and everything else that's going on, we were kind of going through a bit of mental discussion. Then we listened to a talk in our meditation time and Shri Mataji was saying, "Do you think I was going to let my creation be destroyed by these human beings?" It's such a relief.

There she is, protecting us and holding us and guiding us in every way, isn't it? I think we're lucky this time. This talk I was just studying about creation, she said she made so many creations; some of them still exist and some of them don't. It sort of makes you feel a bit small. But somehow we did something right this time because the Param Chaitanya grew and the self-realization spread, and she had so many children loving her and sharing that love to please her Lord, that she did a good job.

I have the feeling that all this will happen within our lifetimes because things are speeding up. In a way, it was a pre-incarnation for the last incarnation of Shri Vishnu. I was just reading in this talk, she said so many things. When the karmas become too much, there's a literal weight on the Mother Earth, and Shri Vishnu comes not just to correct dharma but to relieve this weight of the sins from the mother. I have the feeling that's piling up and something will happen. I'm looking forward, hopefully in this life, to see the end of all evil. I'd like to still be fit to be able to be involved in the fixer-upper part of Krita Yuga, where you have to beautify everything again.

Interviewer: Thank you so much for joining us today for the session of Golden Memories and Unparalleled Times with Shri Mataji. And thank you, Shri Mataji, for making all this happen and for having us as your children. Jai Shri Mataji, again and again.

I hope we all remember that she's so intimately in our spine, watching and recording every lifetime. She's so intimately alert and aware of everything that we're going through and helping, not only just aware of it but doing every single thing possible. She's all around us and she's in each other. It's mind-boggling, isn't it? You can't really appreciate it with the limited human brain in the thick maya.

Interviewer: Well, our love and regards to Brigitte, and thank you so much, Edward. Thank you for joining us. Jai Shri Mataji.
