Sorry, I had to little bit help him with his hand. So as you have heard these young artists, you could see in their innocence how creative they were, and attention was so concentrated. It's true, I am telling them, "I know you have to sometimes get hurt and you get pain also, doesn't matter. Because it's only Indian people who can really sing or play this music". I mean Indian artists, you can call them, they may be from Bangladesh or from Pakistan, they are really basically Indians, as far as the art is concerned. "So, you shouldn't mind if you are hurt or anything because you are the only people you can do this".

It's difficult for Western people to take to this kind of music and to become masters, very difficult. So we have seen, of course, one or two people who have tried, but it's very difficult. Like this Yawdi Mehanin, supposed to be a great artist and all that, I have seen him with Ravi Shankar. Poor Ravi Shankar was trying to play with him like a baby, you know, absolutely! He just couldn't play with him. It was just so, he didn't know how to play and we felt that way.

So, it's a great thing that these young people have taken to classical Indian music. Normally, nowadays, you are all enjoying this music, while young people in India, in the city specially, like to have your pop music. So this art can be only kept alive by these young people who understand the value of this classical music. Unless and until they really adhere to it, I once felt that we are going to lose completely our heritage. But some or other it has worked out that I see now even younger generation is doing it. And also I have seen very young, very, very young, two years to ten years as I told you, children being born who know this music just spontaneously.

So this great music must be saved. And there should be people who can play it, who can sing it, who can elaborate it. And, of course, there should be listeners like you. Because they are all saying that because you are so good at listening it, that they felt absolutely at home and they enjoyed your company, and such an audience they have never seen, such silent and good one which was understanding and was absorbing everything. So they are very much thankful to you for that. So it should not be any compulsion on you, but gradually you will realize that it's a very intricate, difficult and melodious Divine music. And we should develop our ears to enjoy it.

The only trouble in Cabella, I find, that nothing starts before ten o'clock.
[Laughter]
Whatever one may try. I was ready since eight o'clock. So they said, "Now they have gone for their food". Then all right. I said, "Now is it all right? Now is it all right?" So there is no timing for it. You see, somehow, I have seen, but as you enjoy everything, it's all right. What does it matter if it is late or earlier?

For tomorrow they are going to have a havan. Maybe here, they will try, I don't know where their idea is. They can do it here also. It's a good idea. And in the afternoon, in the evening time, we'll have our pujas. That would be better, I thought. I hope you are not hungry or you are enjoying your food, and everything is all right.

May God bless you all.
