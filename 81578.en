One day, it was just the three of us: Shri Mataji, her granddaughter Anupama Nanu, and me. Shri Mataji was doing an oil massage for her granddaughter, and I was just rubbing Shri Mataji's feet. We were watching a movie, something with Hema Malini, and we were just laughing and laughing. But as I was rubbing Mother's feet, I suddenly had so many thoughts in my head, and I started feeling really nervous. Mother said, "Don't feel guilty."

It was sometimes really joyful, but when you massage Mother's feet, you wonder what thoughts are coming. I don't know why our brains do that, but sometimes it happens. Another time, at Shri Khyam, I was feeling very joyful while I was massaging Mother's feet, and I thought, "I would really like to massage her body." The next time Mother came to Shri Khyam, I got the chance. For 15 days, I was massaging her back and everything, and it felt like my whole body was frozen. I felt so much joy. I had to phone John and tell him how I felt. It was like I didn't know where I was. It was such a wonderful thing.

Regarding films, in America, we were watching The Wizard of Oz once. When they all faint in the poppy field, she said, "This is prophetic. This film is prophetic."

I wasn't there for this next one, but a few days later, Sarah was there, and they were watching the science fiction movie 2001: A Space Odyssey. When HAL, the computer, really started to take over, Shri Mataji said, "Once they take over, you'll be finished." So, that was pretty horrible.

Another time, watching films in Hampstead, we called around, and Mother had the television on. We were very embarrassed. There was Mother sitting there, with that beautiful, very young picture of her on the wall, and on the screen was Marilyn Monroe and Robert Mitchum in River of No Return, or something like that. She plays a nightclub singer, and there she was with not many clothes on. It was really embarrassing. At the end, he picks her up and takes her off, and her red spangly shoe falls off as she's going off to be a wife. Mother turned around and said, "That was a very good film."

Then she turned the channel, and it was James Bond and Pussy Galore. It was terrible. And she just commented, "He's only with one woman."

I watched Gaslight with Mother once. I was in her house, and Helen Marsden was there as well. We'd just had lunch, and Mother was walking around the room. She said, "I'm bored. What shall we do?" She got the remote, pointed it at the television, and immediately Gaslight came on. She said, "Ah, this is a very good film. I like this. Let's watch this."
