Talk to Sahaja Yogis
New Delhi (India)
Talk Language: English, Hindi | Transcript (English) – Reviewed | Translation (Hindi to English) - NEEDED

Today I want to talk to the Sahaj yogis also because from this particular place there are very few people wo have come and most of you are Sahaj yogis who are, trying to know many things which I didn't have sufficient time to explain to you. Now I wanted first of all to tell you something about the sickness of the people which perhaps I have not elaborately told you about how to cure people and how people suffer from different sicknesses. As we are now on the principle of the being, we must understand that sickness also comes if there is something wrong in the principle that builds up the human beings. So now basically there are two principles which affect the body and the third principle affects the evolution. So, the first principle of left sided Iccha Shakti or the desire, power is if in danger we develop lots of diseases due to lethargic organs. Left side is the tamasic side, is the side where darkness is affecting people. Those people who live in too much darkness or in the past or in a sly way, in a hidden way who are introvert we can say in short, who spend their life mostly in a very aclosed waters or live with people who are extremely cautious and afraid of others. All people who do not talk much or who avoid meeting people, who "Shun People'. All such people are left sided, are having his body tamas. Such people are in their spiritual awareness or spiritual ascend try to take to bhakti. They take to bhakti more. They worship God from their heart, from their emotions. They work through emotions. There are twenty-four types of relations they establish with God. Thats called as bhakti relationship we can say. And they dwell upon it and all the time weep and cry and say O God when will I meet you. Such people are the ones who take dominations from other, suffer, sacrifice, and lead a life of great sufferers. But in their expression, in their achieving God they start doing bhakti. And they think through bhakti they will come to God. But with bhakti God comes to them. Because of their bhakti God comes to them and he incarnates for the bhaktas. The ones who cry for God, he incarnates. So, there is nothing wrong with those people. Now these people eat extremely imbalanced foods as far as proteins are concerned. And in proteins they are so weak that they might suffer from all lethargic muscles in every way. So, you can see that these people suffer from cold, they suffer from diarrhoeas, because the muscles are weak. They will eat the food, the whole food will pass out as diarrhoea. They will have lethargic hearts by which they will get a heart which will not pump the blood, swellings in the body. Also, they might get this gout and these troubles of the joints. They also get the lethargic liver which gives them allergies. All kind of allergies come to these people through their lethargic liver. So now you have to base all these troubles of lethargic organs of any kind on the left side. For example, a person whose eyes are open but he cannot see, is also suffering from the same type of disease. These people are affected by the subconscious and the collective subconscious from where the spirit attack them and they become involved into this spirit and they have a very bad sympathetic attitude towards themselves . They are themselves miserable and make everyone miserable because they get their ideas from these miserable sly people and they cannot see anyone happy nor do they keep happy themselves. They will make the big fuss out of their so called troubles and sickness and problems and try to create as much problem as possible for others. But the problems are not aggressive . It is more by appealing to the sympathy , appealing to the weaknesses of others . And a person who stays with such people can also get effected if he tries to show sympathies with these people. Cancer and what’s that called as muscular that mellites what u call - muscular descripriencies and weaknesses in which the muscles become extremely weak gradually and which other disease was that ? Osteomyelitis , Poliomyelitis all these lethargic things that makes your even lung lethargic. If your lungs are lethargic then you get diseases like TB - Tuberculosis. Tuberculosis comes from the left side . Now those who are strict vegetarians , who don’t eat any even garlic and don’t eat even onions and all that are very vulnerable to the left sided business . On top of that if they are going to a guru who is left sided , they are even worse. So, one need not lead an abnormal life. One has to be a normal person eating a right proportion of proteins, carbohydrates and fats. So this is one side of Sahaj yoga in which you see that left sided people have to be very very careful and not to just assert themselves on that side . Many people come and argue with me because they said that in GITA it is written , they said so , I don’t know that tamasic people eat lot of meat - is not true. Is not true. Tamasic people are the people they are not bad people by any chance. They are one type, are the people who eat too much of carbohydrates. Because left side is hydrogen and carbon comes from Ganesha on the left-hand side. So, its more carbohydrates. No question of eating too much of meat. But the right sided people have a very very overactive extremely overactive personality. Such a right sided person is eating too much of proteins. All the times meat, this that. And he becomes an overactive person and such an over active person receives a blessing of their ego. And a big ego develops. Such a man aggressively destroys other, the immediance of others, pull them down , criticises others , jumps on them, can be very hot tempered, can be absolutely demonic. As I said before Hitler is the example. Now this type of people who eat too much of meat and too much of heavy food and develop muscular capacities too much more than a human being should have, say they become like horses then they start behaving like horses , worse than horses. And that’s why a person should not take to too much of energy, should keep to the centre. All such people have overactive organ. Due to overactive organs, they develop a very bad heart which is overactive, in which heart pumps fast, palpitation takes place. In lungs he develops asthma. In his intestine he develops constipation . He develops a very very bad liver and a very unhealthy skin. The skin is extremely sallow. And such a person is very very quarrelsome and aggressive . A person who leads a very ascetic life and of martyrdom . For example many government servants think that they are doing a very great work of martyrdom for their country . But such people also become so conscious of that that they are hot bricks, you jus can't go near them. They are extremely hot tempered . Or any person who leads a life for asceticism of a severe type like Vishvamitra , Durwasa all these people. They all become so hot tempered that you can't talk . They are very snappy and their language is very sharp and when they talk, u can feel that is not a person who has any balance in him . But they look very brilliant and considers themselves to be very intelligent but they are actually stupid people. Because they do all kinds of stupid things. They do such stupid things that anybody who is wise can see they have no sense of proportion in doing anything that is against the whole . Such people are vulnerable to many diseases like I said the heart, liver - cirrhosis of the liver, also diabetes, leukaemia, kidney trouble, high blood pressure, uterus trouble. Such people can become barren women. They may not have children at all . Such women cannot have children specially women who are very very flirtatious type , and who think they are very beautiful and also, they are having a very active life, can become completely barren. Also, men can become something -good for nothing - people if overdo, if they overdo things. If their attention in spent all the time fulfilling their ambitions, they can become like that. So those people also who indulge too much into life, and so called enjoy life, waste their time in drinking and being with women and all that. They all can be ruined not only by money but also by their very bad health. Now on the level of right heart you know that such people may have very bad time with their children, may have bad time with their parents, may have very bad time with their wives. At the level of right Nabhi they will have problems of digestion, they may have money but they can never enjoy that money or can never think of living a life which is complete. At the level of the brain, they become ego oriented, the ego can go that level that they develop, they can develop paralysis. Paralysis is possible in both the cases. Even the left side person can get it or the right-side person can get it. But mainly people get it the paralysis on the right side. It effects the left side of the body, but the paralysis comes from the right side, I am sorry. It comes from the left side but effects the right side of the body. So, there are two types of paralysis. One is the paralysis caused by too much of ego, another by superego. Those who have lethargic temperament develop clots in their blood and low blood pressure and these clots cause the paralysis also on the left-hand side. The another one is caused by the damage to the brain on the right-hand side by the overdevelopment of Mr ego within it. Thats how we can summarise on the whole that the diseases of the physical side are caused by these two imbalances . Apart from that we have the mental problems with people. Like a left sided person will have a mental problem like he will be a sly person, he will be a frightened person. He won’t be talking to others he would be nervous , he will not have self confidence, he will be running away from public . And Also then he become schizophrenic that he hibernates sort of thing in the house , doesn’t , he becomes like a cabbage you can say that. That kind of a lunatic symptoms. The another side of the ride side is that such a person becomes a very hot tempered and obnoxious person. Absolutely. Such a person can be so cruel , he can be so troublesome that he would be really a challenge to the whole family , to the whole society and he would be very disturbed. So, this is the second problem, also is a mental case. Now such a person may not look mentally upset - the right sided person. But when they grow old they just talk . They will go on talking so much that nobody can talk to them . You can't even open mouth before them. They go on .... jisko hindi mei khte hai badbadana. They go on jabbering all the time , everything they are telling you. And quite relevantly they will talk of God, of Atma, this that. But just they are talking because they are so egoistical, that they just go on talking, don't allow any body to speak. And such horrible characters if there is even one, seem, you are in for trouble. Because you get headaches from them, and you get other problems that you don't know how to manage them, how to keep them decently in their proper places. So, they are also in a way mental cases because they are not normal. So, on mental side also, we have problems of people who are egoistical or who are accepting domination from others and becoming sly. Sly people are good at spoiling the relations of each other by saying something, by carrying stories, by being sly. And so, both of this kind, extreme type are very injurious to a proper social life . Now ego-oriented person has another very big problem that he asserts his ideas above everything else. So always such a man because he is stupid, an idiotic, the idiotic ideas survive and because of idiotic ideas every planning that is done by such people is a failure. Thats the reason our planning in India has failed. Everywhere it fails. Because the idiotic people, they are stupid, they are ego -oriented just to assert their ideas, they are trying to plan something and that’s how the plan goes out. Everywhere where the administrator becomes much more than what he should be. Then he, his behaviour itself is so idiotic and so much away from reality that everyone has to suffer. If such an administrator he asserting itself in the planning of any program of a country or of a nation. The worst and worst are the rakshasa who are so egoistical that they think of capturing even the Adishakti -the Primordial mother. Is such a stupidity, is the greatest stupidity that they indulge into. So stupid man is a very big problem to the whole society though he never realizes. He thinks I have managed the show; I am the most successful person. But once the history is over, people talk about him as the greatest stupid person ever born on this earth. Like one Mr idiame, who is supposed to be, of what place he is ? now he is not there but he was a Prime minister of Uganda . He was a real idiot. You could see the way he used to talk and all that and he was an idiot. And he said that the people of my country should be called as, from my name . Because you see I am the one who represents this country. So, somebody suggested that its alright but how should we call ? Like from Cyprus people are called as crypto ....what it was? Cypriot. So, if call your name it will become idiotic. So, the people refused to accept this solution. Though he was so dominating. So, there was another one who was, who made shoes out of pearls, horrible , nonsense for his marriage. I don’t know what s no, which was the no of that marriage but he wanted to made shoes of pearls, all sorts of idiotic thing they do . I mean these people who are such extremely ego oriented, surprisingly become very miserly. Extremely. They are so money oriented that they are extremely miserly. They spend all that money on themselves, but not on others. That they will try to save. Any good work has to be done they will keep back their money. But on themselves they will buy the best wines, they will buy best things for themselves. But for others, they have no money. Even where it is their due, they will try to save money. They will not pay where it is the due, which we see among so many peoples even in Sahaj yoga. That they have to pay something which is their due for something which is very important but they will not pay. They wany even free, sometimes the books, sometimes whatever it is for which people are paid. For example, this Panadol is raised now, it needs money. Who is going to pay for it. I paid for at least three to four years myself from my own pocket and my brother helped me to do all this work . And they wanted me to go on with it all the time . Imagine for your self-realization I have to pay. I travelled on my own, I had my own things done. They wouldn’t even pay for what is done. I mean it is required that the people who are organising this program should put up the pandal. I am supposed to give you the realization free but not to pay for this Panadol. Tomorrow you will say Mother also pay for us for coming here and going back , our fare . I am not surprised - you see, such people are extremely miserly. Every pie they pay you see they think we must get the money back . And If anything is done extra for them , that is not counted. Only thing because whatever u can get, you should get, but while giving, they are zero. And these money-oriented people are horrifyingly, surprisingly are rich. One can’t understand how are they rich, because there is nothing like generosity in them. And no priorities, not proprieties as to where you have to spend the money. And there is no self-respect about this . Thers is no self-respect . Its very surprising. You will be surprised if I tell the Indians that I have seen in the west sometimes you go to a hotel with other people, I have never seen anybody offering to pay except for my husband or me. They start looking this side that side. If somebody can pay , very good. Its more surprising, even in countries like Sweden and Switzerland. Switzerland is another the greatest miserly country could ever think of it - is Switzerland. Europeans are extremely miserly people. Most surprising it is - how miserly they are. And Indians in Delhi are - Sahaj Yogis - are very funny . I must say, I was surprised to hear that people just come for food free. I mean, am I supposed to pay for your food also . Pay for your foods , pay for your taxes . Tomorrow you might even say pay for our house rents. Is absurd. All this comes from ego, which doesn't allow you to see the propriety of things. Is very surprising. They will spend money on themselves, buy this buy that. But to do the for proper things they have no money. Most surprising thing it is? Every time I come, I find Mr Verma or somebody tells me that look at this mother, this is the money they have. So Every time, I have to pay out of my pocket to fill up the gap all these things. Every time may be this year also. Now I told them this time I am going to give my Kada , you sell it and get it. This is the situation in this Delhi, where the Sahaj yogis are so Richard that they don’t want to pay even 200 Rs per year. Don't learn things from European Sahaj Yogis. They have to learn from Maharashtrian Sahaj yogis, They are poor people, but never have they taken a single pie from me . They say, mother its sufficient. You are doing so much for us. Other Gurus take their money, extract all the money. Here Guru has to spend money all the time. Can you imagine Sahaj yoga of this kind. Have you heard of such a guru anywhere that the guru is spending the money for Sahaj yoga. I have been sending not this year. 12 years I have been coming to Delhi. I think till last year, I have been spending all my own pocket money. And I don’t know how to answer my husband. He just can’t understand. He said what is this Sahaja yoga that you have to pay for the disciple. I said thank God they don’t ask for their house rents. It’s a very shameful situation. I must say it is a very shameful situation, that where the money is needed, they have no money. There is no budgeting at all of a priority. You are Sahaj yogis, you are saints. What are your priorities? But in Maharashtra you must come and learn. They are poor people; they haven’t got so many riches. You won’t see so many cars in Maharashtra. There hardly one or two people who have cars in Maharashtra. But never such a problem comes up there, whether you go to villages, or to the cities. Nobody makes up an account because the whole account is, we have to pay for this, electricity this that. All has to be paid through my pockets. Thats why I am talking to Sahaj yogis today. So European Sahaj yogis also I have to tell them that they have to behave themselves a little better. This is not the way to behave towards money. It’s a shameful way that I have heard that European Sahaj yogis, some of them are behaving in a very shameful way. Is not correct. Is not a good thing. So, this is the right sided stupidity. You know any kanjoosh man you meet , you just laugh at him , isn’t it. There are so many stories of kanjooshas. So the kanjoos and the lazy which one you would prefer ? I don’t mind a lazy man , but a kanjoosh - God save me. Whatever you may do for them. You see kanjoosh has no sense of shame , ne sense of shame left in him . He doesn't understand what he is doing. Is so surprising it is sometimes that the kanjoosh people have forgotten that their spirit is the most important thing. And they should not save money where it concerns self-realization organising. It is more surprising that these people, when they behave like that all these countries one by one are becoming poorer and poorer. The more you are worried about money, the worse it becomes. Of course I don't need any money. You know already I don’t know how many thousands I have spent out of own pocket so far. But the problem lies that nobody understands that it’s a shameful thing that a guru has to spend for you . Now that's why I said , today I wanted to talk to the Sahaj Yogis of Delhi. I was ashamed absolutely to hear that Sahaj Yogis here can’t even give twenty na ..less than twenty ...18 Rs per month. 18 Rs .... Per month? Those who cannot afford, its alright . Those who are retired ..alright, Children.. alright. But you can't even give 18 Rs per month? Its not even 18 , less than that. I don't know. This is the minimum you can pay. We have to run an Ashram; we have to run these things. You want to have a place, where to go . How can that they? I just can't believe with Sahaj Yoga, if you do not even have this much of generosity. Its better you give up Sahaj Yoga. Better give up. You are not the one who can go on with Sahaj Yoga. Look at your mother, how generous she is. I give you realization, work morning till evening. Today I didn't have a single minute free. I was working. Whole day I have been doing this, doing that. Even for buying things for you for all the Sahaj yogis everywhere. How far I go, I work so hard. And you can’t even give 18 Rs, I can't believe it. I heard about the Sahaj yogis, now you are sitting under the pandal, who is going to pay for it? I should pay? And these carpets I should pay? Is this the way to behave? Next time if anybody doesn't pay like that, I am not coming to Delhi. I am telling you. Next time I will not come to Delhi. I can’t afford it now, anymore. Coming to Delhi means, I have to shell out my own money. every time? Those who have not paid the money please pay, otherwise I will not come to Delhi. I am telling you. I don’t like these kinds of things that you cannot even pay 18 Rs to maintain that ashram, to maintain all these things. This is too much. Now will you please try to understand that you have to be of a calibre to be a Sahaj Yogis. You cannot be a just a rudder person from the road who can become an Adishakti’s son. Can you? I do not want beggars to be my children. Will you be please now all of you decide today that no more of this talk I will have to do. This is the last time I am telling you . Its is a shameful thing and, in the history, it will go down that mother stop coming to Delhi because every time she went there, she had to shell out her money from her pocket. The history of Sahaj yoga will be written in golden letters and remember that everybody name I am going to put down there and those who do not pay please give me their names. Thats it. I want to know who are these culprits. और जो लोग कंजूसी करेंगे उनके साथ भगवान भी बहुत कंजूसी कर सकते हैं। So now we come to the centre, central path of Sushumna. The central path of Shushumna is for the people who are in the centre. The people who have their proper understanding and who have got their wisdom. These people are extremely generous. You take any guru, Sat guru, take anyone take Nanaka, take Kabira or take Tukaram. Tukarama, his children asked him that you get us some sugarcane. So, he was walking and one gentleman who was his master, whose field of sugarcane he was looking after, gave him lots of sugarcane. So his coming go his and all the children started asking give me one sugarcane, one piece of sugarcane. He gave everything. He came home, he had no sugarcane for his own children. They suffer from overgenerosity. They are so generous, you can’t imagine. You should ask people who have known me in that aspect. Generosity is the only way you can express your love to others. I have told you before also. All your material wealth and everything has no meaning unless and until you show generosity for the people. But it should be quite and it should be absolutely silent. I have seen that it’s nice to oblige somebody who comes to our house. Indians are very good at it. Please have your food, this, that because just to impress. later on, they will take out some work from that person or something. But there is no genuine ness about it. Anybody who comes just help, doesn’t matter. Any great cause, what can be the greater cause than this work of God that I am doing. And there I find you people behave like this. Now where are you going to spend your money. So, the centre people are extremely generous to begin with. They cannot retain food, if they have it at somebody’s house, either they vomit or they will have diarrhoea. If they eat at a place where they should not have it , if it is not properly vibrated, if the food is not good, they will not eat. Even if they eat the food, they will vomit it. They are extremely kind and generous . They do not suddenly jump on people and say ooVoo, you have a food that has got this and that . If it is so , they try to avoid not to eat . but sometimes they are crucified , alright doesn’t matter . They say alright I will eat and throw it away. They are extremely wise and tactful. tactful. They know how to deal with people. Thay are extremely, diplomatically gifted to please others, and somehow or other bring them to the temple of God . The whole attitude of such people is to clean themselves , to keep them clean , to keep them alright , to get more and more people to this great work of realization. They never show off. I never see them before. They never stick on me. They don’t show. They are not in front . They don’t want to show their faces. They are quiet. I know who they are. But they are dynamic and they work it out. Only when they have to consult something important, they will come and see me and tell. I know the way they work, extremely silent and beautiful, gracious people they are. And they also know, how to handle others. They can sometimes get into temper which is necessary if they have to protect the protocol of their mother. Or could be the protocol of Sahaj Yoga. And of God. Normally they are very quiet and silent people. Their presence is blissful. Whatever house they enter, it is auspicious. Whatever shop they enter, prospers. Whatever person they talk to, is benefitted. They are auspicious. They are blissful. They give blessing. Automatically. They don’t have to say, I bless you. If they are there, they bless you. They never think of making money out of Gods work. Never. Not a single point. They are so truthful. Not because they are afraid that if we make money the thief will come and take away all our things. Not with the fear, but with the full confidence. That what they are doing is the greatest happiness and joy. And their health wise, they are more on the fatter side, I should say. Because they have gas in their body. lot of gas. The Pran Shakti - is in the centre. In the Prana enters into Shushumna , that creates the gaseous body. The gaseous body is not heavy. Is very light, they walk very fast. They are active. But to look at they look plum. Normally. if they are not, they try to be plum. They want to be plum. They want to find that what’s wrong with their liver so that they could be plum. They are rather on the plum side. Their main disease is their excretion. And their all kinds of vomiting and all that. For example, a person who eats a wrong type of food, or a wrong type of liquid has to immediately go and vacate it. This is their problem. Another problem they may develop that if they have taken too much vibrations, they may develop a swelling on their body. Under these circumstances, first of all they should find out if they are in the neighbourhood of somebody who is antigod. Because such swellings are developed when the vibrations are fighting an antigod activities of the person who is with you. Say your wife is negative, then such a person might develop a swelling because his vibrations are fighting the women. He shouldn’t mind that fighting. But he must know how to correct the women. He must know how to put her right. Or the man if he is like that, the women might develop an anti-devil force within her which will give her that swelling. Different types of swellings might appear with the vibrations jetting out with a great speed. They might develop Arthritis, if they don’t give vibrations, or pain in the joints. The other problems they may have is of very low breathing. Low blood pressure because of parasympathetic activity. And when they are fighting with the antigod activities, they might feel tired also sometimes. But again, they recoup and they feel alight. At every centre if the vibrations start flowing too much, then all these people may develop, may develop I am saying a kind of a suction or emission of vibration depending on the quality of the person who is facing them. And when such a thing happens, they can easily correct it by giving a Bandhan. And in case they find the vibrations are too much , then they can ask another Sahaj Yogi to take out a vibrations from a particular chakra and give it to the atmosphere. They may suffer from the throat trouble, also may suffer from the drying up of the liquid in the body if they have to fight the antigod elements very much. So, a kind of a dryness can develop in their peritoneum or may be in their tracts which are covering them. Thats why it’s nice for them to eat some ghee or butter. They must rub their fingers and the hands and all these places with ghee or butter to sooth it down. Because the heat from the other people also can make them dried up. At the Agya level they may sometimes develop a headache with people who are very much caught up on the Agya , on the right side. Its important at this time to give a Bandhan to yourself and to other person who is very egoistical and don’t listen to them. Just close your ears and the person will stop talking. Also, they might develop some pressure on both the sides of the head. Sometimes when the kundalini cannot flush upwards , there is an obstruction on the Agya. You might feel a pressure on this brain plate. At that time, they should try to bring the grace on top of all the sympathetic systems, bring it down , put stand on the mother earth, ask her to suck it. So the kundalini’s pressure is reduced because when the grace comes all the body then all the chakras open up and also agya opens up. If there are problems with their Agya, they should use a candle at the back, if their eyesight is getting weak or short sited. If their Agya is too much here, there are mantras which are to be used like I forgive everyone and all that . On a subtler way you know the all the mantras that are to be said. If a Sahaj yogi finds a Shastrara catching then he should take a bath in the sea, I think. I don’t know where he should take a bath. Because Shastrara is my place as you know. And to catch the Sahastrara is a very serious thing for a Sahaj Yogi. He might develop a Ekadasha with that and he will be in trouble. And then he will come and tell me that Mother though I was a Sahaj Yogi , I was praying on your photograph and all that. Still, I got this trouble. The reason is that when you are a Sahaj Yogi , you have to recognize me. Thats the condition. So far you have never recognized anyone , but now you have to recognize me . If you don’t recognize me , you will develop this Ekadasha, and I tell you that if you try to do like this then it is not possible to allow the kundalini to come up. So Sahaj yogi who are very doubtful and still like this, should not be called as Sahaj yogis. They should be kept out as far as possible. Let them learn that they are not worth it. Let them know that this realization has been given by me and by nobody else. Like once Venugopalan told me that Krishna did not give me Realization, Rama never gave me Realization, Ganesha never gave me, Shiva never gave me, Parvati never gave me , Adishakti did not give me. It was Mataji Nirmala Devi who has given me Realization. So she is the one I know. Unless and until you understand this, all Rama, Shiva, and Brahm deva, Vishnu, everyone is going to get angry with you. Because they will not understand . Because you have got your realization, still you are denying me that means something wrong with you. And the whole plate can be covered and you might develop Ekadasha, that’s the beginning of the end . Taking too much advantage of me is also like that. Too much sticking on to me, also you might get this Ekadasha. Must keep away. Too much pressurising me you will get it. Answering me, not listening to me. When I say, I want to do this you will say no no let’s do this. You catch. I know what to do, when to do, where to do. I know that. I know when I should reach a place. What I should raise the kundalini, where it will work out. I know everything , you have to leave it to me. And if you start challenging me, you will catch on Shastrara and then don’t blame me. Only in Sahaj Yoga, if you could rise and ascent and try to recognize me, I will have no problem, you will have no problem. If there is anyone say your wife or husband and anything who talks against Sahaj Yoga, put your hand, close your eyes. You are not to hear any Ninda of me at least. If you don’t understand, you don’t understand. Because after all you are not me. But know that I have given you realization. And you should not try to challenge me. Because God himself will be against you. This is very ungrateful of you to behave like this. So, first thing you must do is not to trouble me much by any chance. You have to keep Prasanna. This is what we always say that keep the Devi Prasanna. Yesterday the music was on, I was very Prasanna. You should have been happy, that the music was on, Mother is Prasann. Thats all. But no, you wanted it to be your way. You hurry me up. You say come along now you have to go. Thats all. Then your ascend is not going to be alright. If You may are a big administrator anything, that is in the office not here. Here I am the one. You have to leave thing into my hands. Don’t try to play tricks with me. Because apart from my mother's heart, there are many other Ganas you see, many other deities, many other great things which are waiting and they may try to trouble you. So as Sahaj yogis I have to warn you . New people won’t understand this . For them it will look like egoistical and all that. They won’t understand , forget it. But there are very few new people , that’s why I am talking to Sahaj Yogis and telling them the truth. Because so far as I have had no chance to tell them all these things. So, it doesn’t matter as Sahaj Yogis you are saints. And you must have that dignity of a saint and that generosity of a Saint and a sense of priority and propriety. I hope Delhi Sahaj yogis will begin from tomorrow a new life in their behaviour आचरण में लाओ। बाते करने से कुछ नहीं होने वाला आचरण में लाओ। And try to be good Sahaj Yogis to begin with .Yyou cannot compromise on certain things . Sahaj yoga , you will be amazed, is such a great science. Even one line here and there, they are finished . The other day a gentleman came and told me I don’t believe in such an such saint. Say a Muslim say that I don’t believe in Gourmania. Immediately his vibrations must go down. Finished. But much worse when you say about me, or think about me. If there is even a thought coming see that you just because Gurunanaka is a person within you. But he didn’t give you realization. He and me are one . There is no difference at all. But what he feels when he has become me and giving you realization, you don’t want to recognize me then all right. He is the one who will be angry. Not me. We have always seen people who worshipped Shiva. In the hand they keep Shiva, they catch on the heart where the Shiva stays. Because Shiva himself is angry. Sahaj Yoga is a very dynamic thing and for that we don’t need these people who are good for nothing. Kanjoosha are out . Absolutely. You should be extremely punctual and anxious - Aatur to do the needful for Sahaj yoga’s work. It’s a tremendous work. While we have people who are so anxious, they are willing to stay here, they are willing to go anywhere. They are willing to do any work in Canada, want to go to America, work it out. And here we have people. Its Surprising . In the Yog Bhoomi, this is Jangpura, just imagine , this is Jangpura. Maybe here the Jung I don’t of who, which people took place. In Hastinapur, a great Jung took place long time back where evil forces were fought. But was there anybody like the people we have here. Can you hold the Sower of righteousness in your hand, when you do not have any righteousness in your behaviour. We cannot be like these ordinary politicians and these business people. We are saints. Understand you are Saints. You can’t behave like them. Cheapish way. I never take anything free from you. It’s very difficult to give me something unless and until there is a purpose or some sort of reason, I would hate to take anything. You know that. So, I should be your ideal. You will be very much respected if you behave like a saint. Saint has to be Saintly within and without. One person who behaves like that shines everywhere. Everybody knows ohh here is a great saint has come. You don’t have to become very wealthy person for that. You don’t have to be big politician, or a big minister, nothing. An ordinary person can clear the whole thing. So, I think one way of improving this would be that all of you should take up responsibilities, you should try to travel around. Now some people should travel around, go establish some centre, look after them, then go somewhere else establish that centre and look after. Now Establish a centre in Jangpura or some place. Try to come, bring it, distribute some hand base in the market places, get some people ... establish. There are hardly few numbers of people who are organising. It’s not the way. Every one of you part and parcel of the whole. So now, I have to tell you today again, I have to go somewhere. And so, you have to excuse me. I hope you don’t mind today that I won’t allow to, it won’t be possible to make you touch my feet. It’s alright there is no need to touch my feet at all. I will tell you a very sweet story of Shri Krishna, and Radha and then I will go away. Once it happened that the ladies who were married to Shri Krishna got very jealous of Radha ji and they told Shri Krishna that you don’t love us. On top of that Shri Narada came to put more oil on the fire. That he said he really, I believe he never cares for you. He just likes Radha Ji. He is not bothered. So, Shri Krishna as diplomatic as he was, he started saying ohh god, I have a terrible pain in my stomach. Now what to do? so they said now what to do? So, he said it is very simple anyone who is my bhakta, if you can give a dust of your feet for me to eat. Then I will be alright. So, they got a fright of their life. As it is if I tell you anything you just want to give your solutions every time. Nobody listens to me. If I say go here, no no it’s better to go that way. Baba come here, no no no this way is better. Everyone has a brain way about it. Doesn’t matter. So, they had brain waves, they said they said you see why don’t you take some medicine? then somebody will call the Vaidya. He said I know for definite that I cannot be cured by anything else but one thing that you have to get a dust of one of my bhaktas. So everybody started looking at each other ,you see as some of the Sahaj Yogis do when it comes to pay. They never heard it some of them, never heard it . Better you see it is very tricky nature. So, they said now what to do? If we do not cure Shri Krishna, he is just ailing, and what to do? Shri Krishna said have some pity on me. Give me some dust of your feet. So, he said to Narada that you go and ask Radha to send her dust of her feet. So, he went to Shri Radha.
Shri Radha ji was in Vrindavan, and the soil of that place is yellowish in colour like Keshar like saffron. So they said, she see and went told that Shri Krishna is very sick and he got a terrible pain in his stomach. So she got a fright she said really, how can that be. I can’t believe it. So what does he day? what treatment can he take? He said any one of his disciples, anybody his bhaktas he says can bring little of the dust of their feet, he will be alright. He has to take that as medicine. So, she said alright take the dust of my feet. He was amazed. He said what are you doing? You understand...if you give him the dust of your feet then all your punyas will be lost. He is playing some trick, you know. Just don’t try these things. She said nothing doing, you better take it. Bu he said t what about your punyas and papas? She said I know one thing, it is he who looks after my papas and punyas. I have not think of that. So he took the dust of a feet which was absolutely yellow like a saffron or like a pollen of the flower. And he went and gave it to Shri Krishna. Shri Krishna said I knew Shri Radha will send it. He said now let me eat it. He said you can eat, but now you have to answer the question that Shri Radha has said that you look after her papa and punyas. How is it? How can it be? What does that mean? that you know what is punyas and papas are. And she is not bothered about it. She has not worried about her papas and punyas. He said alright now let me take the medicine. Then he took the medicine and he said I will better sleep. And Shri Narada saw the heart of Shri Krishna open and in the heart was the lotus of very beautiful pink colour. On that lotus was lying Shri Radha Ji. And her feet were rubbing against the pollen of that lotus and the yellow of the Vrindavan clay was the same colour as that. And then he realized that when she is touching that lotus with her feet what does that matter if she gives her dust of her feet to Sri Krishna to eat. She is in his heart. When her feet are is in his heart what does it matter? and that’s how they realized thar Shri Radha’s love was so great that for her she didn’t think of dharma adharma but judged to be at the command of her love she acted and that’s how she had a place in the heart of Sri Krishna. May God bless you , I hope tomorrow we will meet again and I talk to you at length about kundalini. Those who have come for the first time today should at least come tomorrow and I will tell them all about kundalini and I am really now fed up of talking on introduction . So, you can take the book, read about it, come back. Sahaj Yoga is yatharth and also I will give you realization tomorrow. I am sorry, I have to go for some work today and that’s how you must excuse me today. I hope you don’t mind. Thank you.
