1990-1105 PUBLIC PROGRAM Day 1 BANGKOK

I'm sorry for being late but there was some sort of flooding and the whole road was closed! I bow to all the seekers of Truth.
At the very outset, we have to know that the Truth is what it is. You cannot conceptualize it, you cannot organize it; also you cannot feel it with your human awareness. You have to become a subtler being. The truth is that you are not this body, you are not this mind, you are not these emotions. But you are the Spirit. And another truth is that there is an all-pervading power of God's Love about which all the scriptures have been written. So the aim of spiritual ascent is to seek the Spirit. You have to be the Self. Unless and until you become that, you will be filled with a kind of emptiness. And you will feel extremely restless about it. This all-pervading power is the one that does all living work. We take it for granted, these beautiful flowers, everything, we take it for granted. We do not also think how from a little seed these beautiful flowers have come out. But there's a mechanism within us also, which will sprout and give us the second birth. For this, you cannot pay and we do not pay to Mother Earth for what She does for us. We cannot pay for it. But people have forgotten that it is so invaluable. And there are so many false people also preaching and taking money from all the people. All the religions we started by these great incarnations and prophets also have now become man-made. If you are intelligent enough you can see for yourselves that they have achieved nothing for us. All these incarnations and prophets were born on the same tree of life, tree of spirituality. Only the people have taken away those flowers, and they called it that they are mine, ours; and then, they are fighting with those dead flowers. So there was nothing wrong with any prophet or with any incarnation. What we have to do to get to the essence of everything? And the essence of every religion is to seek the Eternal and to know the limitations of Matter. And it is transitory so we have to use it with all understanding. So now, it is important that at this juncture of human race, a new age have started. It is an age of our mass realization.
I am sorry that I have come to Bangkok very late. This is I should say the last country that I am visiting. It is working out in 56 nations and there are people who are now giving realizations. Like one enlightened light can only enlighten another light. So this is the age of Enlightenment in the real sense of the word. It's not some sort of an artificial, pretentious belief; and it has to work out within yourself, the transformation. I would say today being the first day, I would like you to ask me some questions. First thing I must say that whatever is said to you should not be believed into with blind faith, but you must keep your mind open like a scientist and see for yourself. This is like a hypothesis for you. And if it is proved, as honest people, you have to accept. Because it is not only for your benevolence but for the benevolence of your children, it is the benevolence of the whole world. If this instrument is not connected to the mains it has no meaning. In the same way, if we do not get connected to the mains our lives have no meaning.
So what Buddha has said is that "Buddham sharanam gacchami" that is you have to surrender yourselves to Buddha; buddha means enlightenment. But that doesn't mean it's just a mental concept, it's a state. And then He has said "Dharmam sharanam gacchami". So, the Dharma is within yourself. It is like ten valences within us. You may belong to any religion, you may be Christian, Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, anything...you can commit any sin. Human beings may have many brands, but they are all just the same. Because there is no dharma enlightened within them. That is "Dharmam sharanam gacchami", then "Sangham sharanam gacchami". Sangham is the collectivity. But when you get your realization, you become (it's again becoming) part and parcel of the whole. It's not just a certificate. You can feel it on your central nervous system, on your fingertips, all your centres and the centres of another person. And if you know how to correct those centres, you can cure yourself and you can cure others. You can help people mentally, in mental cures, physical cures, but above all, spiritual Joy starts going through you. Tomorrow, I will tell you the nature of Spirit and the nature of this Kundalini which is resting in the triangular bone called as the sacrum. But today, I would definitively like to have some questions from you which are relevant. Please.

Yogi: What is the meaning of the word "Sahaja"?
Sri Mataji: Sahaja, all right, I thought they must have told you. "Saha" means "with", "ja" means "born": "born with you" is the right to have this yoga, yoga means union with the divine. In short, Sahaja means spontaneous; I mean like a living process. 

Yogini: [UNCLEAR]
Sri Mataji: Hardly anytime. Awakening takes no time but you have to establish yourself fully; some people do it in three days, some people take at the most one month, but you completely get established. And for which you don't have to pay. But you must have value for your life, that is very important. Moreover, it cannot be forced, it cannot be forced. It has to work through your asking, through your freedom. 

Yogi: You said that you use this particular technique to get enlightenment; what exactly You mean by enlightenment?
Sri Mataji: Enlightened means that your central nervous system...whatever you have achieved in the evolutionary process, you can feel it on your central nervous system.
Now, supposing there's a dog and the dog can go through any dirty lane, but for human beings it is difficult. The reason is evolutionary process has brought us the sensitivity to dirt and filth. But when this enlightenment takes place the Spirit which resides in your heart, which is just a witness, starts enlightening your attention. I told you that on your central nervous system, you can feel the different centres of people and your centres too. And you know the absolute, absolute truth; because you can feel the cool breeze. In case, whatever you ask, it's yes about it, like a computer. Supposing there's a man who is dressed up like a sâdhu baba and comes here like a saint, how will you make him out, whether is true or not? But even if you have 10 children who are realized souls, you tie their eyes they'll immediately tell whether he is false or not. So lots of false ideas, lots of blind faith drop out. Supposing we are sitting in the darkness and somebody is holding on to a snake, and you tell him that's a snake, he may not accept till he bites; but if there is even a little light, immediately he drops the snake. I've seen wonders of Sahaja Yoga, that people taking drugs and all kinds of funny habits just drop them overnight. So you know the absolute truth and you know about yourself and you know about others. Your attention becomes very pure. So much, so that even a glance of such a person can do wonders. There is no lust and greed in the eyes anymore. I mean you become a saint. But there's no show about it; you lead a very normal life. You become extremely dynamic, full of energy, but you are extremely compassionate. The description can take one complete lecture. So it is better to experience this all-pervading power. Is there any question, any more? That's good. I think if you all sit on one side, it will be a better idea. All of you. One should not feel...I think that people are a little upset because of a few people, but one should not be upset because, in the beginning, it's always so. 
See there is no end to knowledge and I must have given thousands and thousands of lectures only in the English language. But when you come to this hall, I had just to tell you that you put on the one switch and all light is coming. But it is all built-in within you; the system is all built-in just like as if this is built-in. So if I go on telling about the history of electricity, how it came to Bangkok, it is quite boring. Best thing would be to get the experience. Now, there are three conditions for our ascent. First one is that you have to forget the past and not to feel guilty at all. People might have told you that it's a sin and all those things that you are sinners, so don't believe that. After all, you are human beings. You are not gods. You are the only ones who can make mistakes. So please, do not feel guilty. Now if you feel guilty then the centre here, on the left-hand side, catches very badly. It's a very dangerous thing also because it gives you diseases like angina and all the diseases which are caused by lethargic organs. Moreover, spondylitis is another disease you can get with this feeling guilty.
The second condition is that you have to forgive everyone in general. Most of the people say it is very difficult to forgive; but whether you forgive or you don't forgive, you don't do anything. But if you do not forgive, then you torture yourself and play into the wrong hands. That means you live with a myth. So, in general, you have to forgive, it means don't think of each and every person, just say I forgive everyone. You feel much lighter immediately. 
Then the third condition is that you all have to be extremely self-confident. You are not to doubt yourself. You are all capable of getting Self-realization. So, please don't be diffident, don't count your mistakes. Now you feel guilty and forgive everyone in general. This will help us a lot to raise the Kundalini. If you do not forgive then the centre on the optic chiasma is like this, very tight and it won't open; it has to open out like that; otherwise, the Kundalini won't rise. So, all your life you tortured yourself, now at least at this time you should forgive everyone. I mean to say you should be very pleasantly placed towards yourself. Because you do not know what Glory awaits you. You will only know your meaning and your greatness once you get your Self-realization. 

All right, now very simple things we have to do; [Yogi's name/UNCLEAR], can you come here, please? You can show them, come along. Now, he will show you how we are going to nourish our centres ourselves. 
First, you see that, and then we will have to close our eyes; it will take hardly 10 minutes altogether. I'd be happy if you could take out your shoes because this mother Earth helps us a lot. And both the feet have to be apart from each other because these are two powers which work within us. Please, keep the shoes behind, it would be better. Now, please put both your feet away from each other. Left side is the power of Desire; the right side is the power of Action. So you please put your left hand like this on your lap very comfortably. You have to sit comfortably, not bending too much or bending backwards, but you are comfortable. The left hand towards me like this suggests that it is your desire to have Self-realization; it's symbolic. The right hand we will use for nourishing our centres on the left-hand side. All right; so now -he will show you also, you can have a look- put your right hand on your heart. On your heart. Here resides the Spirit; but the seed of the Spirit is in the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in our childhood. Then we take our right hand on the upper portion of our abdomen, on the left-hand side. This is the centre of your master. This is created by great incarnations of great masters, like prophets. Now, this right hand you have to take it in the low portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side and press it hard. This is the centre of pure knowledge. Pure knowledge is that which manifests on your central nervous system. This is what Buddha is. From where the word Buddha has come. That means it is not mental, but you feel it on the central nervous system; also from Vidyâ, Vidyâ is meaning the same thing. Now, raise your right hand again on the upper portion of your abdomen and press it hard with your fingers. Again, raise your hand on your heart. Now raise your hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder. And turn your head to your right, fully. I've already told you that this centre is in jeopardy when you feel guilty. Please do not feel guilty about anything. Now put your right hand on your forehead across and now put down your head. This is the centre where you have to ask for forgiveness, you have to forgive everyone. Forgive everyone in general. Now you have to take your hand back on the back side of your head and push back your head. Here you have to ask forgiveness from the all-pervading power, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes. Now the last centre, which is important: stretch your hand palm fully, bend your head down and put the centre of your palm exactly on the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood. Now press it hard, push back your fingers; important is to push back your fingers so there's good pressure. Good pressure on your scalp; now please move your scalp slowly seven times clockwise, slowly seven times clockwise. That's all we have to do. There's one thing you have to bend your head, that's better. Then you can pressurize it better. And don't move the hand, move the scalp, please. All right, that's very simple now. 

Now, we close our eyes; you may take out your spectacles. If there's something tight on your neck or on your waist, you can loosen it a little bit. Close your eyes please; keep both the feet away from each other and left hand towards me. Now please put your right hand on your heart; nowhere you have to ask a question to me. You may call me Sri Mataji or Mother, whatever you like. Now ask a very fundamental question: "Mother, am I the Spirit?". Ask this question three times. Please ask this question three times. Now if you are the Spirit, you are your guide, you are your master. So now please take down your hand on the left-hand side in the upper portion of your abdomen. And here you ask a question again three times: "Mother, am I my own master?". Ask this question three times. I have already told you that I respect your freedom and as you have to attain the complete freedom, I have to respect your freedom. So I cannot force pure knowledge on you. You have to ask for it. So now please put your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. Here, you asked six times because this centre has six petals: "Mother, please give me pure knowledge". Say it six times. As you start asking for pure knowledge, this Kundalini starts rising. So we have to nourish the upper centres with our self-confidence. So please now raise your right hand onto the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side. And here you have to say with full confidence ten times: "Mother, I am my own master". I have already told you that the truth is that you are the Spirit. You are not your conditioning, your ego, but you are the pure Spirit. So now please raise your right hand on your heart and here with full confidence say twelve times: "Mother, I am the Spirit". This all-pervading power is the ocean of knowledge. It is the ocean of compassion and bliss. It is the ocean of Joy. But above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness and whatever mistakes you commit, this ocean of forgiveness is very powerful and he can dissolve all of them. Now raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder. And now put your head towards the right, fully. Here you have to say again with full confidence, 16 times: "Mother, I am not guilty at all". I have already told you that whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything. It is a myth that we do not forgive and as a result, we torture ourselves and play into wrong hands. So now please raise your right hand on your forehead across; and please fully put down your head. Here you have to say from your heart, not how many times: "Mother, I forgive everyone in general". Please send your head, please bend it. I forgive everyone in general, please is very important. Say from your heart. Now please take your right hand on the back side of your head and hold it tight. Push back your head as far as possible. Here, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, just for your satisfaction, you have to say from your heart again, not how many times: "O Divine power, if I have done any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me". Please put your hand on the back side of your head, push back your head. Now, the last centre; now stretch your palm, put the centre of your palm on top of your fontanel bone. Now again I cannot cross over your freedom. I respect it and I cannot force Self-realization on you; you have to ask for it. So now press your scalp fully and move it seven times slowly saying "Mother, please give me Self-realization". Bend your head. Move your skull clockwise with full pressure.

Now take down your hands please; please put both your hands towards me like that and watch me without thinking; now put your right hand like this and bend your head and see with the left hand if there's a cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area. Now don't put your hand on top of your head, please; away from it, some people get much further. You might get also a hot breeze, it doesn't matter because you are not forgiven. Now please put your left hand towards me and now bend again your head and see for yourself if there's a cool breeze coming out of...now do not doubt...maybe hot breeze. Now please put your right hand towards me; again bend your head and see for yourself again if there's a cool breeze coming up. Now raise both your hands towards the sky like this and fully bend back and ask a question three times: Mother, is this the power of God's Love? Other: is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost; Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya? Now please bring down your hands, please. All those who have felt the cool breeze or hot breeze out of your head or on your fingertips and hands, please raise both your hands; both your hands, please. It's good. May God bless you. You all felt it? Then, good. 
Tomorrow again those who have not felt it will feel it tomorrow and I'll meet all of you individually. Also, you can telephone to your friends and ask them to come. Isn't it? And or maybe they are feeling guilty? So tomorrow it will work out. I am sure it will. Thank you very much. Hope to see you tomorrow with all your friends, and I hope to be here very early. And I'll explain to you everything. (The white skin doesn't get it). There, they all got it. Good, we hope to see you tomorrow again and get more friends. Now you should not discuss around you because this is beyond mind. You can't think about it. If you start thinking you lose again the vibrations. So thank you very much. It's a very good beginning. 

Yogini: You will give us course?
Sri Mataji: Yes.
Yogini: When?
Sri Mataji: Tomorrow. We'll be having a follow-on here later on. Tomorrow, I'll tell you all about this, everything, and then they will have a follow-on. I will tell you everything. All right, tomorrow; and also we are having here some people who are staying over there come all the way from Switzerland and they want to have a follow-on program.
Yogini: [UNCLEAR] We are very late.
Sri Mataji: What happened is that today there was some sort of flooding on the way and for this, we were stuck at the airport. Do you come from what part of India?
Yogini: I live here for 20 years. I'm Jaïn. 
Sri Mataji: Jaïn is the thing I'm teaching you. What Parshwanath has done, you see. Jaïn is to know.
Yogini: Yes, I know.
Sri Mataji: So now this is what it is you have to have, all right? All right; May God bless you. I'm very happy. 

A yogini, leading another yogini to Sri Mataji: She has a problem in the back.
