Good. We will now tell some sari stories, and each story is such a proof of Shri Mataji's love for each one of her children. It's so beautiful to hear all these stories, and it's only the Divine who can handle such situations.

My first sari story was in 1985 in Vaitarna. It was the announcement of the weddings, the first year, the weddings that took place in Ganapatipule. When I heard my name and the name of my husband, we went to meet. We didn't look at each other; we just said "Namaskar."

Nearby was a big table with a lot of saris. Shri Mataji was there, and near Shri Mataji was Grégoire. Grégoire said, "A sari for this man, please, Shri Mataji." And in one second, Shri Mataji picked up a sari out of these mountains of saris. And this is the sari she picked up.

(To the person showing the sari): Can we see it? Yes, don't hold it. Just hold it a little bit further away. Perfect. That's perfect. Yes.

And the sari has the color of the earth, you see, and a nice bordure. Shri Mataji gave this sari to my husband. My husband said, "What should I do with it?" He meant, "Should I keep it or should I give it to you?" And in my brain, there were just a lot of thoughts. I had already bought my wedding sari, and I didn't have any money to pay for this new sari. So my first sentence to my husband was, "You have to pay it." That was the first story.

The second story was in Poland, in the 90s, in the hotel in Warsaw, where Shri Mataji was staying. When I saw the sari, I was completely moved. I looked at her and I said, "Shri Mataji, you have so many children all over the world. How do you know that—not pink—red is my favorite color?" She just smiled and looked at me and she said, "You see, you are my children and I know everything about you."

I heard the situation again. She was talking about the situation in a puja that was following afterwards. And in this puja, she said "Yes." And this lady, I was so moved to see that she knew the color of my sari.

Finally, the last sari story that I got from Shri Mataji was in 2009, when Shri Mataji came to Vienna for our new ashram. Of course, we were happy to have her in Vienna. But on the other hand, it was a time when she was looking sick. She was in a wheelchair. She didn't interact with us as we were used to. She was no longer talking with us. It was, in a way, very sad to see her like this.

So, we have this new ashram in Vienna. But since 2006, we also have a new center, a Sahaj center, in the center of Vienna. We knew that she would not be able to go there. So, with Steve Jones, we prepared an album with pictures of this center to show Shri Mataji. We could immediately go into her room. She was sitting. Near her was Sir C.P. Sir C.P. was holding this album and showing Shri Mataji the pictures. And Steve was explaining how it was, describing the programs, and so on.

Later on, Shri Mataji was giving presents to people. I got this sari—not red—a green sari with a gold border and so on.

(To the person showing the sari): My dear, just hold it up again without moving it. And a little bit further back from the camera. Like this? Yes, higher. Perfect. You see, like this? Yes. Yeah.

But the story is not finished because some months later, I met a yogini who told me, "I'm glad to see you, Christine. Because, you see, I observed something. I was watching the video where Shri Mataji was giving presents to yogis. For each present, Sir C.P. took Shri Mataji's hand to put it on the present to be vibrated. But for your sari, Shri Mataji immediately put her hand on your sari without the help of Sir C.P." And for me, it was clear that it wasn't destined to me. We had just presented this new center, Postgasse. And for me, it was this delicate, great way of Shri Mataji to give blessings to this center.

This center has been running since 2006 every day of the week without interruption. We have programs, music, German, English, Russian. We have workshops. We have other meetings. It's just running. The vibrations are so strong and flowing since 2006. And this is just the blessing of Shri Mataji. Jai Shri Mataji! Jai Shri Mataji!

(To Christine): Christine, I wonder if you ever thought of donating that last sari to the center itself? No, donating that sari to the center. I wondered if you ever thought of donating that sari to the Sahaj center.

No, because I had already worn it, wie sagt man, ich habe ihn getragen, bevor ich das gewusst habe (I had worn it before I knew that). I didn't notice this, you see. It was just some months later that a yogini told me this. I didn't notice it then. But then you realized, yeah. Yeah, so I wore it already. Wow.

(To Christine): Christine, they're beautiful, beautiful stories. I'm just going to pause the recording a second. Yes.

(To Dara): Dara, thank you for sharing your stories with us next. You know, I wasn't going to even... I thought, 'Oh, I actually don't have saris from Mother personally.' I do, and I just want to share. For me, when I first came to Sahaja Yoga, I found myself about a month later in Romashram, and I had no clothes because all the clothes I had weren't appropriate for Sahaja Yoga. So I was a bit perplexed. What could I wear? I had almost nothing. And dear Jane Marlow said to me, "Oh, Dara, it's no problem," and she brought me to this room. This is the old Romashram, the first one. And this room, the whole wall of it, was filled with saris. She said, "Anyway, we are to wear saris every day." And she handed me a sari and showed me how to put it on.

I fell in love with these saris. It's something fabulous for me. It's something—I don't know—this beauty, like Shri Draupadi, being covered in this protection of Mother. And it's one piece of fabric. And yet, each piece of fabric is such a gorgeous artwork, and folded up, it's like surrounding the whole universe. Every woman looks beautiful in a sari. It doesn't matter if you're thin, you're hot, any shape. Women just look like queens in the sari. And for me, this is... I can just thank Mother. Just that graciousness that when you put a sari on, you walk differently. I just love saris.

So I don't have any saris left from Romashram. That was, this was 36, 37 years ago. But I do have from my India tour. We were given saris by Mother. And these are the two I have left. I just show the border. The cotton is super thin now, but there are just these beautiful borders on it. And the colors, it's just something fantastic. And I always, when I'm looking for a sari to buy, I always try to find saris with these very traditional, very simple designs. One color with these beautiful borders. And yet, when you wrap it around, it's just so elegant. It's so nice.

I'll tell one of the later stories. I had the opportunity to be in India for three months this past winter. And I stayed in Alibag, and the "mummy" there, she gave me this beautiful sari with the top piece as a gift when I left. So, when we went to Delhi, we stayed near Maldon, and it was February, and it was literally ice cold there. There was no heating, obviously. You would go out the building and walk across the grass, and the grass was literally ice.

So, for the morning meditation at six, the last morning I was like, "I'm just not going to bother. It's just too cold because you're just sitting there shivering. You can't really meditate properly because it's just so cold." So Manfred left to go meditate, and then I stayed. But then I thought, "Oh shoot, I'm just going to go." I quickly put on a Punjabi suit and opened the door to go out, but I couldn't leave. Something was stopping me. So I thought, "What is it?" And I thought, "Okay, you have to put a sari on."

So I took this sari and I put it on. It's super thin; it's for summertime. And I put on my silk underwear underneath, coat and jacket, and sweaters and shawls, and trudged across the grass and got there as soon as it was almost time for Arati. They always have Arati at the end of the meditation. I walked in and sat down in Namaskar, and got up, and somebody was standing there and said, "Can you please do Arati to Mother?"

In Nirmal Dham, when you do Arati for Mother, you go into a glass enclosure around Mother's Swayambhu. You enter this, and they give you everything. Then they close the door behind you, and you can't hear anything. You can't hear a thing outside. They're playing the recording of the Arati, but you can't hear that. You can't hear the planes crossing overhead or anything. So, basically, it's just whoever is in there doing Arati and Mother. At the end, there's Mother's Swayambhu and Mother's silver padukas, and all these beautiful flowers. Then you're standing with the tray there and singing Arati by yourself. It's just the most incredible experience. And I was like, "Thank you, whichever deity, for not letting me leave the room without putting a sari on," because they only let people with saris on do the Arati. So, yes.

(To Dara): I can't see anybody. It's a bit disconcerting. Do you think everybody can put their—I mean, Dara, it's part of the recording requirements really. Because it's just easier for the recording if people's videos are turned off. Okay. I know it's very difficult for the person talking because you're kind of talking into a vacuum. Yes. But that was a beautiful, beautiful story. Yes.

When Jibra, our first child, was born in 1991, Manfred went on the India tour, and he came back with seven saris for me from the saris Mother always had for sale, which she had purchased. So Manfred went and bought seven saris, and each one was more beautiful than the other. I was just in shock—seven saris!

And then there was this sari, which was very simple, somehow, compared to the other ones; it had no designs on it, just very simple and plain. I just kind of put that one aside. We were living with another couple then, and Ganga said to me, "Did you see that blue and red sari?" I, because she had been on the tour also, said, "Yes, these other ones are so beautiful." And she said, "Do you know this? Mother had very few of these saris, and nobody bought them because they were so expensive."

The next day, Mother got really angry at all the husbands and said, "You have to buy these for your wife! These are the most precious saris. It's Banarasi silk." I don't know if that means anything to anybody unless they're Indian, but it's a very special hand-woven silk, and the border has real gold in it. Unfortunately, it's all shredded now; it's so old. I can't wear it anymore, but I just have it there. I hold it. I don't know what to do with saris that you can't wear anymore, but it's precious. These are ones Mother has specially chosen.

And there was also, oh, I don't have it here like Christine. Oh, there it is! This sari. It was in Vaitarna also. Like Christine, we had already been married for one year, and she was choosing the saris for the brides, which I wasn't anymore. But then she said, "You know, the other ladies can come and I'll choose them a sari." So I went, I was there looking at saris, and I picked up this bright pink sari. And she came and said, "No, no, no, no, no." I was, how old was I? 27, 28. Like nowadays, you'd be shocked. And she picked this sari out for me.

Again, I can't wear it anymore because it's so worn through. She said, "Older ladies need to wear lighter colors." And, you know, I was 28, and I was a bit in shock. Not because I didn't think I was older, but I mean, actually, in those days in Sahaja Yoga, we were all, like, 28, 30, the oldest ones, because there were very few. Like now we're all older, but in those days, I guess, at that age, older. But I understood from Mother that, not that I'm an older lady, but that I have to mature, and that I'm no longer young. I'm no longer an unmarried woman; I have to behave with a certain dignity. It was a very humbling experience. And I felt such love and care for Mother, that she somehow taught me, instead of reprimanding me and saying, "You have to behave differently," she did it in such a sweet and gentle way by choosing a sari for me. And I also love this. I don't know what to do with saris you can't wear anymore, but yes, that one.

It's like, "Thank you, Mother." And this sari was from Mother. It was at a Navaratri Puja in Cabela. Mother had just been in Japan, and she had brought back their polyester saris. She brought back these saris in all different colors. Yes, she said they're very unique. They've got a weave and a print on them, so they're really nice saris.

And yes, I just love saris. I feel it's that tattva, it's that essence of womanhood. When you put a sari on, you feel Mother's protection, and you feel this grace. You walk differently. Every time there's an opportunity to wear a sari, I put one on. It's such an honor, I feel, to be able to use them.

And this is the last sari I'll show you. When I was in India, I was with my sister-in-law, and we were sari shopping in Delhi. We were nearly the whole day in this shop. It's just so beautiful; they're just such a work of art. This sari...

(To the person showing the sari): That's the wrong way around. Yes.

So, it's not for an older lady, I suppose, because it's not a light color. But I do love it. I was going to take another sari—it was very simple, a light color, very plain. But there was a young boy who was helping us. And I said, "No, let me just take this sari." And the young boy who was helping us out, he said to me, "You look like the mother-in-law. If you buy this sari, you're like the mother-in-law." And then Annegret and I burst out laughing hysterically because I am actually the mother-in-law. I was with the "mummy" of my daughter-in-law buying this sari. So, we were both laughing hysterically. And then we told him that I am actually the mother-in-law. But she said I should buy the sari also, and that the other one was boring. So, there you go. Those are my stories. And thank you for listening.

(To Dara): Yeah, Dara, I know exactly what you mean. I was just saying to somebody the other day that when I wear a sari, I walk with a gravity and a serenity that I don't have at other times. Yep. Yep. Yep. And I wish that, like Draupadi, when Trump was president the last time, I prayed that the women of America can be clothed in Mother's—all these saris that Mother's given. Mother said once that Draupadi was probably protected by all the saris that we've offered to her during the pujas. And so I prayed, and I pray now, that the women of America and all over the world, that they have that protection of this sari, of Mother's saris around them. And that all these horrible men are shocked by the Dharma of Shri Sita, of Draupadi, of Shri Radha; that it stuns them. And they recognize Mother. It's my deep prayer. Yes. Should we just give a bandhan for all the ladies in the world who need that protection? Right. I feel like, yes. And that the men recognize that all the women are their mothers, are their sisters, are the queens, and that they bow down before the goddess, the innate goddess.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

(To Padmini): So for the last stories today, we go to Padmini. I'm just going to share first a couple of pictures of Shri Mataji wearing a certain sari. Padmini, would you like me to show both before you start talking about them? Or do you want to just—

Yeah, yeah, please.

(To the screen): Okay. So this is one. I'm ready. Is that okay? I showed them, I think. No, did you see them? I can start now?

Yes, please.

My name is Padmini. I'm from Chiplun. My husband is John Watkinson, he's from the UK. We were married in 1987. Sorry, 1988. I had a long wait to come to the UK. In the end, Shri Mataji asked me to come to Cabela. And I was quite, very lucky, staying in Shri Mataji's home in Cabela. We used to live in the amazing ground floor. That time, I got the chance to make Shri Mataji's food: Shri Mataji's lunch, dinner, and breakfast. And serving her breakfast every day. Shri Mataji told us, "Before you cook our food, always meditate. Use Bandhan and raise your Kundalini. Then you start the food." And we used to do the same thing.

It was such a joyful time every morning, early morning, serving Shri Mataji tea after breakfast. And Shri Mataji just talking, it felt like she was your friend. You felt so joyful at the start of your days. One day, Shri Mataji showed me how to make her bed, like a hospital bed. She showed me how to make it. It felt like she showed you as your mother, as if you were a small child, how she showed each thing. Such a feeling with Shri Mataji. Just feeling, you know, you were really lucky with God. And all that time spent with her, really, really good.

One day, we had to go to a picnic at Thalya with Shri Mataji and the grandchildren. At that time, I was just alone in the kitchen. And she came into the kitchen. And she said, "Today the children, they love paratha and keema." It's like mince lamb, they call. Then she showed me how to cook it. She took out all the lamb fat first. After that, she added all the garam masala (clove, cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, and garlic), cooked it, and put in the onion. After that, the keema. It was such a lovely dish. She was holding the pot with her hand. And I said, "Shri Mataji, it's a very hot pot." She said, "No, it's okay for me." And then she cooked and gave it to my hand. She said, "Just try to taste." And it felt like when I had this food, my Kundalini just came up, you know. Unbelievable, Adi Shakti coming and showing how to cook this thing. We went to the picnic at Thalya, and we went to the small river there. We really, really enjoyed that day. Such an amazing time.

Another thing, one day, Shri Mataji washed her hair. And she said I should dry her hair with ajwain smoke. They put some charcoal and they put ajwain. Drying her hair... I was so glad, and her hair was so velvety. But I had to be really, really careful, you know, because sometimes the ajwain would really spark. And it was unbelievable, that experience. Such a lovely, tremendous thing, you know.

One day, Shri Mataji said to me, "I have a special sari for you." And she went inside and she got this sari for me. We'd like to see the photograph I can show you. You can see how it looks. This is the sari. That's the pink part. This is the pink part, Shri Mataji, this one. She's wearing.

(Moderator): She needs to have the camera on you. You can see. No, they can't because the photo's there. Let me just stop sharing now. Ah.

This is the sari, and this is the border here. She said, Shri Mataji said, she wore this sari for a long time. It's very beautiful cotton and beautiful design inside, all in pink color.

(To Padmini): You see properly? Yes, we can see properly. John, if you just hold it still, it's best. Yes. Beautiful. And she wore it in Australia and seaside; she wore it at that time also, this sari.

(To John): John, can you just show the pink side once more? Yes. Beautiful.

And she gave me a matching shawl also. The sari's matching shawl and cardigan. That's the one she gave me. This is the shawl.

(Moderator): Yes, we can see it beautifully.

And this is the cardigan. That's the cardigan she gave me. It's matching all the stuff.

(Moderator): Wow. Yeah. Kept you warm during the winter there.

And the cardigan, I wore the sari a few times, and I use the shawl, but the cardigan I just keep it as a special thing, you know. It's a very special thing, you know. It's a really tremendous gift from Shri Mataji. And in Cabela, you could see Shri Mataji every day. Even after the puja finished, she used to come inside the Cabela house and wash her feet, and all the kumkum water, all the vibrated water, you could use this water, put it on your Sahasrara, you know, sometimes you could put it on your face. Such an amazing, tremendous time in Cabela. And we were so lucky. My husband used to work in Cabela, all the angels, all he did in Cabela. One day, Shri Mataji was looking at those angels, and one of the UK Sahaja Yogis was there. She called him and said, "Can you see the angels?"

And he said, "Yeah." And she said, "Look at these angels. John Watkinson put these angels, and love still comes from these angels. You can see," and that story is very nice. If you go to Cabela, you can see the three big angels at the entrance that were made by my husband. And my first baby was born in Cabela, close to Novi Ligure Hospital. And Shri Mataji held her when she was 10 days old. Shri Mataji gave her the name Meenakshi because her eyes looked like fish. And she said it's one of the goddesses' names. She said, "This is a very, very old soul, born to be born." And my daughter was laughing so much when Shri Mataji held her. It was such an amazing time. We used to go to all pujas, and after the puja, to see Shri Mataji every single day. It was really a tremendous time. We were all so lucky to have Shri Mataji as our Mother, attending the puja and enjoying each other. Really, really, thank you, Shri Mataji. Thank you, Shri Mataji.

(John Watkinson): I'll just add that we had a difficult time. The British government refused Padmini a visa, and Shri Mataji's attention was on it for a long time. So we had a very difficult time. It took about five years before we were actually together, and it was quite a tapasya. But at the end of it, we had all those blessings. I got to work in Cabela, and Padmini eventually came to Cabela. And so the Divine knows the right time, because there were just so many blessings at the end of it all, when we were finally together, you know. The Divine knows the right time for everything. And we both knew that it was meant to be. It was just wonderful. Anyway. Jai Shri Mataji. And thank you, Shri Mataji, for giving us as soldiers of life, and all over the world, brothers and sisters. Thank you very much, you know. Jai Shri Mataji. Jai Shri Mataji.

(Padmini): So I think, when I came back to the UK, I got to massage Shri Mataji's feet one day, and there were very tremendous, amazing vibrations. And in the healing house, one night, Shri Mataji and me, and Shri Mataji's granddaughter, we were just watching a movie. Shri Mataji massaged her granddaughter's head, and I used to massage Shri Mataji's feet. And we watched a Hindu movie all night. In the movie, something happened, and I felt guilty. Shri Mataji asked, "Why are you feeling guilty?" Because Shri Mataji just knows small things. And the whole night, I was doing this massage, Shri Mataji's feet, and talking with her. It's such a joyful time, you know. Wow. Yeah.

And then, I feel I have massaged Shri Mataji's feet, but I had said, before Shri Mataji came to the healing house, I went to Shudy Camp. I just said, "I'd like to give Shri Mataji a body massage." And then, at Shudy Camp, she asked me to do her back massage and everything. And just, you feel, look like you in the fridge, and how joyful, you know. Such amazing times in the UK also, at the healing house and Shudy Camp. And when Shri Mataji moved from Shudy Camp to the healing house, it was such a tremendous joy for her. She looked like such a small child. And in the healing house, in her bathroom, they had put angels, and she was so happy, showing Sir C.P., saying, "Look at these angels." And you never saw how her face looked, full of stars, and just, I don't know how to explain it. It just looked like Christmas; such a joyful time, her moving into the healing house, you know. Wow. Yeah. It's just a shame that we don't have any video to capture it, you know. But, I feel, it's a memory, all of this, you know. It's unbelievable.

John has lots and lots of experience with Shri Mataji. John wrote a book recently; it's a very nice book. It's all his experiences about spending time with Shri Mataji. I think. Thank you, Shri Mataji. Thank you so much.

(Moderator): Padmini, first. So, I'm going to stop the recording now. But thank you to all three of you ladies who have contributed this evening. It's been wonderful.
