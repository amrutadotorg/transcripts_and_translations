Before I met Shri Mataji, I was a student. With John, I was going to a hatha yoga class. I just decided I wanted to get fit, so we went to the class, and the girl who was running it had seen a poster of Shri Mataji. She knew something about Shri Mataji, and she said, "I've heard of this lady. I've heard she's very good. Would you like to come along?" So we said, "Well, yeah, all right then." We went along, not knowing anything about what we were going to, just because this girl had said she was very good. We went to Dr. Johnson House in Birmingham, and it was 1978.

We weren't married then; we were going out with each other. So we went, and we sat down. There were probably about 30 people in the room. Shri Mataji started talking, and I thought, "Well, I really like what this lady's saying." She seemed very, very genuine, and she struck a chord in me. I liked what she was saying.

Then she gave realization. I can't exactly remember what she did, but I remember she came down and worked on every single person in the room. She came to me and said, "You must say the Lord's Prayer three times to yourself." Then she moved on and worked on somebody else. She came back to me after a while, put her hand above my head, and said, "Ah, you've got it." I sort of looked at her and thought, "Well, what have I got?" because I couldn't feel anything, actually. I didn't feel the cool breeze, and I didn't feel vibrations. I didn't feel different. I didn't even feel thoughtless. So after she left, I thought, "Well, this all sounds very nice, but obviously it's not for me." At that point, I thought it was a shame.

At the end of the meeting, I can't remember who it was, but it might have been Bala, who said to everybody, "Would you like to come up and kiss Shri Mataji's feet?" So we all got up and just stood in a line. I didn't think anything of it. I didn't think, "I'm not doing that," or, "Yes, that would be great." I just thought, "Okay, then." So we all stood in a line and kissed Shri Mataji's feet. I think I remember her putting her hand on my back when I did that.

So that was that experience. I went home not feeling anything; I didn't feel vibrations at all. But I went to bed, and when I woke up the next morning, I went downstairs to get a paper. I remember walking along the street and feeling completely different. I remember thinking, "I feel slightly drunk." I was walking along feeling very light-headed and thinking, "Well, something must have happened last night." So I thought I must have gotten something.

That day, John had previously asked the person who was organizing the meeting if we could see Shri Mataji again. And he said, "Yes, you can come to my house." It was Bala, and he was living in Tamworth at the time. So we both went that Sunday to Bala's house. We walked into the living room of a little modern, semi-detached house. There were a few people there, probably 15 or 20. I remember seeing a couple of armchairs, and obviously one was set up for Shri Mataji to sit in. There was one next to it. I asked, "Is anybody sitting in that one?" They said, "No." So I went and sat in it.

It's a little embarrassing now. I just sat in it, and I put my feet up. Shri Mataji came in and sat in her chair. She turned to me—I was right next to her like this—and she said, "Can you feel the vibrations? Put your hands up. Can you feel the vibrations?" I said, "No." She said, "Put your hand above your head. Can you feel the vibrations now?" And I said, "No." And she just laughed and went on to the next person. So obviously, I should have been feeling something, but I wasn't.

I can't remember a lot about that meeting, but I do remember Shri Mataji addressed everybody in the room. They were all sitting on the floor. She said to one girl, who was just sitting there, "You must forgive your father." And this girl just burst into tears. I think Shri Mataji said something like, "You have to respect your parents. You may not like them, but you have to respect them." And so that was the end of that experience for me.

Great. John, you were with Frances in these two meetings.
