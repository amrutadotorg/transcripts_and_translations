Some of the TM people... Well, we didn't know at the time. We didn't know who they were. What happened was that a phone rang. I picked up the phone. "Hello." I forget what else I said, but I know I said hello. This fellow said he wanted to know about Sahaja Yoga. Well, at that time, I wasn't particularly eloquent as regards talking, and I mumbled on about Sahaja Yoga, about vibrations, and about Shri Mataji.

The odd thing was that while I was talking to him, I felt that the place was surrounded by TM. I don't know what I meant at that time, but that's what I felt. It was surrounded. And so I said to him, "Do you do any sort of yoga or any sort of meditation?"

He said, "What's that to do with you?"

And I said, "I thought maybe you might be doing TM." I was hit by this stunned silence.

Then the voice said, "How do you know that?"

So I started to explain how certain centres have certain qualities, and when these qualities are marred or damaged, it's caused by certain actions. I said, "I felt that the problem with you was TM."

That was when people doing TM started coming to us. They felt that there was a problem because they knew they weren't actually going anywhere. They were spending lots and lots of money, but it was like you go up one step and there's another one, so you never really get to the top. They thought that there must be something else to find.

The fellow that I spoke to, as I say, was David Prole, apparently. And he told his friends what had happened. He found out about Shri Mataji in a magazine called Yoga Today.

Now, there was a David Baxter—it's funny, a lot of the early ones remember David Baxter. He was a local reporter, and he wrote an article for Yoga Today on Shri Mataji. Unfortunately, having written that article, he gradually slid out of Sahaja Yoga for a while. Mother said that was because he was attacked. But he wrote this article.

David Prole got this magazine and put his hands on the pictures of Shri Mataji, and he was sort of revolted by it. So he thought, well, there's got to be something here, and he wanted to find out about it. But he lost the Yoga Today magazine. Then, what happened was he was unwell and he went to the doctor's. And at the doctor's, he found the magazine there. A similar sort of thing happened. So he took a note of the number, and fortunately, he got me on the end of the phone.

I remember the two girls that were with me when I answered the phone. I put them back—I said, "Stop. Stop." I put them back like this, but I carried on. As I say, it had this profound effect on him, and that was when the TM people started coming. One of the very early ones was David Prole, and also Dr. Spiro and Linda. David came from the university; it was Weston who brought him in. I was there at the meeting, it was a freshers' meeting. Dr. Spiro came from there as well.

The people from TM brought in a lot of drama for a while. When we tried to raise their Kundalini, they had really dramatic effects. They'd scream and howl and jump—all kinds of things, just from raising the Kundalini or starting to say a mantra. It showed you the power of the vibrations.
