I bow to all the seekers of truth.

I have been telling you that the truth is that you are the Spirit and there is an all-pervading power which looks after you, looks after every living being, does all living work. All the problems, human problems come from ignorance that they do not know that they have to become the Spirit. We try to seek joy in various things like material wants or money. Or we try to seek joy in pursuit of powers, worldly powers. Or we try to form our own attachments in different places like our children, our family, our house, our home.

Thus we exhaust the energy of our centers and we feel exhausted and get diseases, physical, mental and emotional. I have seen a very common diseases in Moscow. One of them is what we call as diabetes, another is liver. Third is high blood pressure and blood cancer. All these are caused by the imbalance of one center within us. That is the second center that we have here, the yellow coloured one. The main work of this center is to give energy to the brain, which thinks too much, to replace the grey cells. So those who think too much all the time, worry too much about future, plan too much about future or physically work very hard, use this center more...
