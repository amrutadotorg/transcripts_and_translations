 (England)
No, I wasn't an intellectual at all. I ran away from home, ran away from school, and wondered where I fitted in society. I sort of tried everything. Then I was on Crete with my two children, who were 11 and 14, living in a cave. We had fresh water, so I had to put everything there, and I was smoking. One boat a week came around, and we got supplies from it. The other thing I was doing totally wrong was I didn't wear any clothes, and one of my kids was 14, bless him.

Anyway, in this cave—which later turned out to be a swayambhu, because the Greek leader gave Mother a present from there—a voice, a dawning, came into my heart, right inside. It said—I remember it so clearly, because it's not the sort of word I would use—"You will find what you are looking for. You will find it in the bottom of your heart." It was this sort of dawning, and within one week, I had my realisation. This was from Crete back to Brighton.

I went home, straight back to Brighton. I was just about to go into meditation, and I had all the false gurus, everything, on the table. The person who was looking after my cats while we were traveling said, "Oh, I know of someone. I've got a friend, and he's into that sort of thing as well. He gets a cool breeze." And I said, "That's it, that's it! You've got to take me!" And it was Kingsley.

Kingsley's girlfriend had just gotten her realisation in London, and he had gotten his three weeks prior. He was the only Sahaja Yogi outside of London in Brighton. So I kept saying to this chap, "You must take me." I went there, and Kingsley came down with long hair, dressed in red, with all these cats. We went up into his little room, which had a pyramid in it. There was this mirror on the wall with all these pictures, and there was a little photocopy of Shri Mataji in black and white—you could hardly see it. He said, "That's a picture of God." I remember thinking, "I'm so glad God's female."

Anyway, we sat down in front of this mirror, and I could see myself in it. I could see this smile getting absolutely fixed on my face. He said, "I'm just going to say some words which might help." On the back of a piece of newspaper, he had written Mother's Mantra. I said, "Whatever it is, I think I've got it. I feel amazing. I've got it!" I had this big grin.

He said, "That's great. Well, should we have a joint to celebrate?" Because that's what you did then. I said, "Well, I feel pretty stoned already." He said, "So do I." It was just great. We were just talking, and within a few minutes, the whole thing made sense. He talked about reincarnation, and that was it. I went home singing "The Lord's My Shepherd," the sort of thing I knew, and in the morning, I thought everything was amazing.

I saw my friend and said, "I didn't realize that the heaven and the bliss and everything you were looking for could be like this." I thought that was illegal. It was just amazing. That was it.
