There are loads of stories I could tell you that could be dismissed as coincidence, but I'm going to tell you a weirder story. I was at the hospital in Washi, in India, during the morning meditation. I don't often meditate well, so I'm not going to pretend I'm a great meditator. I'm not. So I thought, "I'll just sit here as if I'm waiting to do Mother's Puja. I'll sit here for six hours if I have to. Eventually, I'll get into meditation."

I sat there, and I didn't go into meditation, but the weirdest thing happened. I was at loggerheads with two kids I was teaching at a special school. What I'm going to say is not very pleasant, but they were about eight or nine, somewhere around that age. I don't often dislike kids, but I actually really disliked these two. They were horrible, nasty, fighting with everybody, giving me no end of grief, and kicking off all the time. I really didn't like them, but I wasn't thinking about them at that moment.

Suddenly, my heart turned into a womb. Seriously, I've never experienced it since. I felt these two kids in my heart, and it didn't feel like my heart; it felt like a womb, and it was sloshing. These two kids. I thought, "What's this about?" and just went with it. I didn't think much of it, but I was staggered by it when I came out. I told you, didn't I, Philippa? I thought, "Oh my God, that was an amazing experience." Then I just let it go. I wasn't in a meditative state; it was just happening, and I was observing it as if I were having a cup of tea.

Time went by, and when I went back to England, I returned to the school. Something really, really weird happened. This kid that I had absolutely detested saw me in the hall, ran across, and jumped into my arms. The same thing happened, more or less, with the other kid. He didn't jump into my arms, but when he saw me, he said, "Oh, sir, sir, sir!" and came and gave me a big hug and a cuddle. I was like, "Oh my God, what's happened here?" I had no clue what had transpired between my time in India and these kids in England, but something had happened that had melted them or purified them in some way.

Interestingly, I don't know if anybody recalls this, but Derek once gave a talk where he said, "Oh, Mother, I'm a lecturer, and I have all these people. How can I give them realisation?" And she said, "Take them into your heart."

I had tried to do that while I was teaching, but on a mental level. What Mother was showing me was that this is not a mental thing. It wasn't me going, "Oh, I put you into my heart"—all that kind of mental rubbish. This was a reality. They were in my heart. I wasn't visualizing them; they were there. I could feel this thing going on, and what happened to them was reality, not some kind of fantasy. The boy running across the hall and jumping into my arms—that's what happened. I thought, "Oh my goodness, what's happened here?" So that, really, was taking them into the heart.

Amazing.

Yeah, it was. It's very beautiful.

Yeah, it was really staggering.

It is staggering, yes. I was shown what Mother really means, not just on an intellectual basis where you think, "Well, I understand that, let's take them into my heart." There's all that kind of nonsense that goes on, isn't there? You do it on an intellectual level, but this was a real level.

Absolutely.

Don't people generally find it happens quite a lot, just...
